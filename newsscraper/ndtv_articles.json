(Representational)\n\nA special National Investigation Agency court in Delhi on Friday sentenced an ISIS terrorist to seven years of rigorous imprisonment for conspiring to establish the proscribed organisation's base in India by radicalising and recruiting youths through social media platforms. Imran Khan Pathan was convicted by the NIA Special Court, Patiala House.\n\nHe has been awarded the sentence in a case registered by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in December 2015 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Indian Penal Code.\n\nThe case pertains to a \"larger criminal conspiracy hatched by the ISIS to establish its base in India by radicalising and recruiting Muslim youths through different social media platforms\", an NIA official said.\n\nAs a result, radicalised youths expressed their solidarity, allegiance and support to the ISIS and left India to join the terrorist organisation, the official said.\n\nThe NIA had filed a charge-sheet and then supplementary charge-sheets against 17 accused, including Pathan.\n\nEarlier, the court had convicted and sentenced 16 of the 17 accused to up to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for a conspiracy hatched by ISIS handlers based in Syria and subsequent formation of a group \"Junood-ul-Khilafa-fil-Hind\" which owed its allegiance to the ISIS.\n\nPathan was in direct touch with ISIS handler Yusuf-Al-Hindi. He had also received funds to the tune of Rs 50,000 from one of Yusuf's associates Mudabbir Mushtaq Sheikh, who was convicted for making an improvised explosive device and to further the activities of the ISIS in India, the official said.\n\nWith this judgment, all 17 charge-sheeted accused involved in the case stand convicted by the special court."},

Nandigram falls under one of the two Midnapore districts.\n\nMr Adhikari's \"outsider\" swipe at the Chief Minister is also a counterattack at her using the same line of attack that Ms Banerjee often deploys, that of calling the BJP in Bengal an \"outsider\" party.\n\nMr Adhikari, 49, led the Trinamool Congress's struggle at Nandigram in 2007 and captured it from the Left. Nandigram, and then Singur, catapulted Ms Banerjee's party to power in West Bengal in 2011.\n\nMs Banerjee was earlier seen to contest from two seats, the other being Bhowanipore in Kolkata. Today, while announcing she would fight from Nandigram, she made it clear she would not contest from Bhowanipore. But she did hint of contesting a second seat.\n\n\"I will contest from Nandigram as I stick to my words. From Bhowanipore constituency, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay will be contesting in the upcoming assembly elections,\" said the Bengal Chief Minister, announcing candidates for the election starting March 27.\n\nThe Bengal election will take place over eight rounds and 33 days in a marathon schedule that the Trinamool alleges was stretched on directions from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top BJP leaders."},

(File)\n\nAs the farmer agitation against the centre's three farm laws enters its hundredth day on Saturday, union leaders have asserted that their movement is far from over and they are \"going strong\".\n\nThe marathon movement has sent out a message of unity, made \"farmers visible once again\" and brought them back on the political landscape of the country, they said on Friday.\n\nFor over three months, the three Delhi border points at Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur have transformed into townships occupied by thousands of farmers from different parts of the country, mainly Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.\n\nTo mark the completion of hundred days, March 6 will be observed as 'Black Day' as part of which the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal (KMP) expressway will be blocked for five hours, according to a statement from the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, a coalition of protesting farmer unions.\n\nRakesh Tikait of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said they are prepared to continue the protest as long as it is required.\n\n\"We are completely prepared. Unless and until the government listens to us and meets our demands, we will not move from here,\" Mr Tikait, who is among the leaders at the forefront of the movement, told news agency PTI.\n\nDespite several rounds of talks between the government and the farmer unions, the two sides have failed to reach an agreement, and the farmers have refused to budge until the three laws are repealed.\n\nEnacted in September, the three farm laws have been projected by the centre as major reforms in the agriculture sector that will remove the middlemen and allow farmers to sell their produce anywhere in the country.\n\nThe protesting farmers, on the other hand, have expressed apprehension that the new laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of the Minimum Support Price (MSP) and do away with the mandi (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.\n\nWhile a resolution was reached on two of the four demands -- rollback of rise in power tariff and penalties for stubble burning -- in January, a decision on repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee for MSP continues to be stuck in limbo.\n\nHowever, according to the farmer leaders, the movement has achieved much beyond the immediate scope of the protest. It has evoked nationwide unity among farmers as well as recognised the contribution of women in farming.\n\nYogendra Yadav of Swaraj India said, \"The movement has brought the farmers back on the political landscape of this country. It has made farmers visible once again. It has taught every politician a lesson -- not to take 'panga' with the farmers.\"\n\n\"People used to take farmers for granted but this movement has shown that getting into a confrontation with farmers is costly business,\" the activist-political told PTI.\n\nThe fight against the laws was one cause that seemed to have resonated with a large number of farmers throughout the nation, cutting across religious and caste barriers .\n\n\"It has united farmers like never before. Haryana and Punjab farmers are united. Despite deep attempts at communal mobilisation in UP, Hindu and Muslim farmers are united in this protest. Gujjars and Meenas are united in Rajasthan,\" Mr Yadav said.\n\nKavitha Kuruganti of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee agreed and added the movement had proven very \"constructive\" socially as well.\n\n\"The farmers movement has to be assisted on multiple levels. There is a very important but limited agenda of securing our four demands, but beyond that is the issue of what the farmers movement has been able to achieve as larger outcomes,\" she said.\n\n\"In Punjab, socially...things like substance abuse, alcoholism and so on have come down because the youth have been constructively engaged in the movement,\" she said.\n\nShe added that the movement had also \"reinforced the identity of women farmers\". \"Women farmers have been able to assert themselves and make their presence and participation felt,\" she said.\n\nTo mark International Women's Day on March 8, the protesting men will hand over charge of managing the protest sites to their female counterparts.\n\n\"The stage management will be taken care of by women only. Besides, the spokesperson for the farmer movement for that particular day will all be women,\" said Avtar Singh Mehma of the Krantikari Kisan Union.\n\nContinuing the movement over such a long period has not been devoid of any setbacks. One of the major setbacks that the movement faced was the violence during the January 26 tractor parade.\n\n\"There's been the setback of January 26, when all farmers were portrayed as violent 'khalistanis' and so on. The image that was there of the protest before the 26th was intentionally maligned by the police and the government,\" Ms Kurugranthi alleged.\n\nShe added they have also had to \"fend off multiple attacks from the government, including supplies being cut, and locals being provoked against the protestors\".\n\nPrepared for the long haul, protesting farmers at all the borders have already started gearing up to beat the Delhi summer by equipping their trolleys with air conditioners, coolers and farmers. Arrangements for better and steady supply of water are also being made.\n\nAfter weeks of protest in their respective regions, farmers from Punjab and Haryana pushed towards the national capital with their ''Delhi Chalo'' march and camped at Singhu and Tikri since November 26 last year.\n\nThey were joined a few days later by farmers from Uttar Pradesh who set up a camp at the Ghazipur border."},

(File)\n\nQueen Elizabeth II's 99-year-old husband, Prince Philip, was on Friday moved back to a private London hospital after a successful heart procedure, Buckingham Palace said, raising hopes for his recovery.\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh, who turns 100 in June, was transferred from the state-run St Bartholomew's Hospital to King Edward VII's Hospital in central London.\n\n\"The duke is expected to remain in hospital for continuing treatment for a number of days,\" royal officials said in a statement.\n\nA yellow and green National Health Service (NHS) ambulance with tinted windows was seen driving away from Barts, as it is known, at about lunchtime on Friday.\n\nPhilip had been brought to the hospital near St Paul's Cathedral in a similar vehicle, with police and royal protection officers blocking the views of waiting photographers and camera crews.\n\nThe development came nearly three weeks after the former naval officer was first admitted to King Edward VII's on February 16 after he reported feeling unwell.\n\nHe was taken to Barts on Monday for tests for a pre-existing heart condition.\n\nHe had an unspecified procedure on Wednesday, widely believed to be linked to a stent he had fitted in 2011 for a coronary blockage.\n\nHis lengthy stay in hospital has raised fears for his health, given his advanced age, but palace officials have been quick to stress it was not related to Covid-19.\n\nThe duke and the queen, who is 94, both received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in January at their sprawling Windsor Castle home west of London where they have been isolating for nearly a year.\n\nInterview row\n\nPrince Philip, who has been married to the queen for 73 years, is Britain's longest-serving consort and has typically been in robust health throughout his long life.\n\nBut despite his latest medical scare, senior royals have been quick to reassure that he was on the mend.\n\nEarlier this week, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, who is married to Philip's eldest son, Prince Charles, said he was \"slightly improving\".\n\nHis youngest son, Prince Edward, said last week his father was itching to leave hospital.\n\nBut royal commentators have expressed concern about the effect of a tell-all interview by his grandson, Prince Harry, and his wife Meghan, due to be broadcast in the United States this weekend.\n\nHarry, 36, and Meghan, 39, stepped down from royal duties last year, in part due to intrusive media coverage, and moved to North America.\n\nPre-broadcast clips of the interview with US chat show queen Oprah Winfrey have set off a storm of controversy in Britain, particularly Meghan's claim that the royal family was peddling lies about them.\n\nMeghan is also reportedly facing an internal palace investigation into claims that she bullied royal household staff during her time in Britain.\n\nShe has accused them of character assassination and pushing a \"wholly false narrative\", with the row prompting calls for the interview to be rescheduled because of Prince Philip's health.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"},

Due process of law is followed in matters relating to law and order, irrespective of the identity of the alleged instigator,\" the centre said.\n\n\"With specific reference to the North East Delhi riots in January 2019, the law enforcement machinery acted swiftly in an impartial and fair manner. Proportionate and appropriate actions were taken to control the situation. Necessary legal and preventive actions were taken by the law enforcement machinery on all complaints/calls received, as per law and procedures.\"\n\nOn the use of the sedition law, the government said \"public order' and 'police' were state subjects and the responsibility of maintaining law and order and investigating crimes was upto the state governments. \"Therefore, measures as deemed fit are taken by law enforcement authorities to preserve public order,\" it said.\n\nResponding to criticism of the lockdown, the government said any mass movement of people would have spread the disease rapidly throughout the country. \"Taking into consideration these facts, the global experience and need for consistency in the approach and implementation of various containment measures across the country, a nationwide lockdown was announced,\" the centre said.\n\nThe government also listed various steps it said were taken to prevent distress to people and to alleviate the problems of those worst-hit by the lockdown. India had registered \"one of the lowest rates of active Covid cases and deaths globally\", it said.\n\nIn response to criticism of what the Freedom House report called \"Intimidation of academics and journalists and crackdown on expressions of dissent by media\", the government said the constitution provided for freedom of expression under Article 19.\n\n\"Discussion, debate and dissent is part of Indian democracy. The Government of India attaches highest importance to the safety and security of all residents of the country, including journalists. The Government of India has issued a special advisory to States and Union Territories on safety of journalists requesting them to strictly enforce the law to ensure safety and security of media persons.\"\n\nOn Internet shutdowns, the centre's statement said such decisions were taken with the \"over-arching objective of maintaining law and order under strict safeguards.\" The government also defended its crackdown on Amnesty International, saying it had illegally poured in large amounts of money to four entities registered in India by misclassifying it as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).\n\nIndia was among 73 nations downgraded for declines in political rights and civil liberties in the report put out on Wednesday. The report, which ranked 210 nations, noted that states designated \"Not Free\" had reached the highest since 2006.\n\n\"The changes in India since Modi took charge in 2014 form part of a broader shift in the international balance between democracy and authoritarianism, with authoritarians generally enjoying impunity for their abuses and seizing new opportunities to consolidate power or crush dissent,\" the report said."},

Today we'll focus on an issue which each one of our guests has been most keen to speak about, the importance and the future of democracy, both across the world and in India, and how it connects to the health of our economy. We will also look at whether you should be investing in Bitcoins or run a mile from them. But first, let's look at India's stock markets, it's booming. Will that continue?\n\nEverybody always wants to know about which way the stock market will move this year, and for us in particular, will India's stock markets go up even further or will share prices start to fall?\n\nAnd most experts have one truly honest answer, frankly nobody knows. But there are many underlying factors which do impact our stock markets, and many of those factors are not always obvious and it's worth looking at them.\n\nRaghuram Rajan, you have said that the (US President Joe) Biden plan of spending 1.9 trillion dollars could increase inflation. Now that will raise US interest rates and that will make asset values, particularly the stock markets, well maybe not crash, but come down sharply. How will that affect India?\n\nProf Raghuram Rajan: Well, one thing we've benefited from because of the Feds very easy policies, remember in March everything collapsed. Remember where the Sensex was in March and that was a result of portfolio flows leaving India and again, we were in a crowd then, because it left Brazil, it left Mexico, it left the Philippines and all emerging market prices collapsed. We've now seen the reverse of that, money has flowed in, in a really big way, which is why our reserves in India, foreign exchange reserves, are again at an all-time high. Money has come in. And so, this is fickle money. This is money that can go out once again. And so, if the Federal Reserve is eventually forced to tighten policy to combat the inflation, and the Federal Reserve has been very, very docile saying we will not do so, we are going to stay accommodative, but there's only so much they can stay accommodative. So, I would suspect initially what happens is inflation picks up, they look through it. But eventually, if it stays that high, and because of the spending, they have no option but to act. At that point, we'll have another taper tantrum of the kind we saw earlier, unless the Fed manages it really, really well.\n\nNDTV: Just to be clear, you're not saying it is definitely going to happen. But that is a kind of forecast by you, and you always tend to get your forecasts right.\n\nProf Raghuram Rajan: No, no. So, there's many a step between now and there. So, if you have more reasonable spending, you have actually a fairly strong recovery in the US and Europe towards the end of the year, that can lift the rest of the world. That can be very useful. I mean, the US will run a large current account deficit, that will pull in imports into the US, which means China will export, which means China will pull imports from the region, which means many other countries. I mean, one of the things, India's success stories, has been our export performance over the years, something Arvind Subramanian has written very well about. And so again, we have the chance of growing out of our problems, if we are more open, if we embrace the world economy at that point and grow out.\n\nNDTV: On the stock market, while in the real economy everything has been trending downwards, the stock market in India has been shooting up. Ruchir Sharma, the author and writer, who is now a Contributing Editor with the Financial Times, showed us data which points out that there's a real disconnect, the world economy has fallen by 4%. But stock markets around the world have shot up by an average of 13%. That is a kind of 17% spread. And it is even more acute in India. While the Indian economy is falling by 7.7, or 8%, still the stock market has gone up 12%, that's a 20% spread.\n\nNow Professor Milgrom, this is a really startling contrast. The economy plummets downwards and yet the stock markets go shooting up. What is the reason for this huge disconnect?\n\nProf Paul Milgrom: Well, the stock market is about the value for the future. When you have assets, you have to decide where to put them. And one of the things that happened, the interest rates are so low, so if you put assets in a savings account or in bonds, you get almost no return on it. So, people don't have anywhere else to put their money that has reasonable returns. So, they buy stocks and they're not too worried about it. Everybody's talking about a quick recovery at the end of the pandemic. Pandemic assets, although the assets might not be making much money tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, they'll be making a lot of money when the economies bounce back, which we expect they will. So, where else would you put your money? There is no place else. I think that's why people are investing in the stock market.\n\nNDTV: So, you think there's a low probability that the stock market is going to crash in the near future? I mean one shouldn't be too worried about that? I know that's a very unfair question but is that an accurate assessment of what you're saying?\n\nProf Paul Milgrom: As Keynes told us, it's all about passions. You can be right about values and still lose money in the stock market because other people have different opinions and they drive, you know, the GameStop stock way through the ceiling. Or something crashes when it shouldn't, you should always worry about that and mitigate your risk. And if you need the money in the short term, you shouldn't be investing in stock markets. But right now, the reason the values are so high, I think, is that interest rates are so low. There's no place else to put your money. And there aren't safe places that have reasonable rates of return. And so, people are pouring their money into the stock market because they have very little choice. That's what I think is going on.\n\nNDTV: Professor Kremer, how has technology changed the world as we know it in this pandemic? And may I ask you a personal question, how has technology during this Pandemic changed your life, for the better or for the worse?\n\nProf Michael Kremer: I have a high enough income. My life is very easy relative to a lot of other people, and I haven't had a family member who's been infected. But you know, not being able to travel to see my father and my brother, that's been painful. My son has been going to school remotely. Again, you know, he can go to school electronically. So that's much better than many children in the world. But it's not a substitute for in-person education.\n\nNDTV: Right. It's been tough. I can hear that in your voice.\n\nProf Michael Kremer: Yes. So, the sooner we can vaccinate everyone, the faster we can end the Pandemic. And increasing manufacturing and delivery capacity for vaccines means we can vaccinate people faster and get back to normal life more quickly. So, think about it like filling a bucket with water. If you try to fill a bucket with a narrow pipe, it'll take a long time. If you can build a high diameter pipe, then it will fill quickly. And vaccine capacity is like that pipe. Now, we developed in the world and especially in India, which is producing a huge proportion of the world's COVID-19 vaccines, we developed vaccines and we produced them at an unprecedented rate. Historically, we've never seen anything like this. But nonetheless, with the currently announced capacity, many countries are not going to be vaccinated for a long time, especially lower income countries. And our analysis suggests that investing now, because there are long lead times, investing now to expand capacity further, would be valuable, because it would let us reach widespread vaccination faster, particularly in lower and middle-income countries.\n\nNDTV: Abhijit Banerjee, you're an economist with a difference, you have always worked with real people on the ground, a differentiating aspect that you won the Nobel Prize for. Looking back for a moment, what were the key aspects in your view of the Pandemic in India and its impact on ordinary lives?\n\nPerhaps the biggest tragedy of this Pandemic has been the impact on poor migrant families. It was perhaps the most thoughtless policy repercussion of the lockdown. I can't even go into it here, it is too, it's too difficult. In fact everyone in India was appalled and actually deeply saddened by what happened to the migrants in our country. Have we as a nation learnt a lesson from that tragedy, a lesson that migrant workers are not only key to our country's economy, but also their numbers are in tens of millions, many, many more than the government ever estimated?\n\nProf Abhijit Banerjee: I think focusing again, with construction, goes the idea of focusing on the migrants and for once, they have actually now acknowledged that migrants are a big part of the economy. I think the 18 million number that they put out is probably too small. I guess this is much bigger than that. We just don't have a data set to get that. But they're also talking about putting some money into collecting data on migrants, so maybe that's something that I would be super interested in finding out what they're planning to do and do it right. Because I think we do it right once and change our view. We'll see, maybe find out there were seventy million migrants or something, and when that happens that's going to change how we think about the whole economy. We still think of the economy as being urban and rural, whereas in fact, it's all these intermediate people who are driving it. So, housing for the migrants is then something, again a construction idea, subsidy for low-income housing. That's all sort of connected around that ball of construction being the hub. And migrants will come to work in construction, stay in low-income housing, low-income housing will be built and hire more migrants, etc.\n\nNDTV: Raghuram Rajan, closely related to any economic revival, is the geopolitical situation. And we've seen US-China tension, some India-China tension as well, but the US-China tension, especially under the Trump administration. And now there's the Biden administration and there's news of a coalition of democracies. India is a democracy, so is it going to help us, how do you see it unfolding, and how will it affect us in India?\n\nProf Raghuram Rajan: Well, I think in a departure from the Trump administration, which seemed to make cozy with authoritarian regimes, Joe Biden wants to reassert the US as the leader of a pack of democracies, or at least primus inter pares in that set of democracies. And it also is a natural sort of coalition to, let's say deal with China, to try and find a new modus vivendi with China. And that's really what the Biden administration has in mind. And in this coalition, naturally Japan and Europe will fit in, but what other countries do they bring in? Now in the past, it would be natural for India to be part of this coalition. Because it's the world's largest democracy, and certainly in the quad sort of structure where India, Australia, Japan, the US come together, those are examples of structures in which India's present. But I think there is also a worry, when you start talking about democracies today, there's a question mark on India, certainly in foreign dialogues, which I think is really, I think perhaps overstating what is happening in India, but also very worrisome, because of the trend.\n\nNDTV: Important that you mention it. But how widespread is this global concern and apprehension about India's democracy? And how important is democracy for even our economic growth, do you see a connection between democracy and our growth rate?\n\nProf Raghuram Rajan: When you see India's democratic bona fides being questioned elsewhere, you know, for sure, our natural reaction is these guys don't know what they're talking about and India's strong and vibrant. But we also know when sitting in India, that there are, there is less room for free debate and free discussion than there used to be. And so, the question is how do we remedy this? Because I think, go back to our medium-term growth. Our medium-term growth, remember we are not a manufacturing power, we are more a service power. It is going to be in the areas of services. And it is going to be where we bring ideas to the table. We become consultants to the world, we become educators to the world, we also become R&D. A lot of R&D is being done in India today, huge amounts. Many international companies have R&D centers in India. So, all that requires free debate, free speech. That's where we score over China. So, to my mind, it would be very important, both in our geopolitical, now that we have problems with our neighbour to the north, our alignments are going to be more sympathetic.\n\nNDTV: Does that mean you foresee some major changes in global alignments, with India becoming much closer to western powers?\n\nProf Raghuram Rajan: I'm not saying we're going to become a standard bearer for the West, I don't think we want to be that. But we're going to be more sympathetic to the West, because we see some democratic affinities with them. And I think given that, and given that our natural growth going forward, is going to be on the export of services, which we do really well. And providing services more, especially now that we can do services at a distance, Zoom, for example, is going to be very helpful in that. I think we should be focusing on creating a greater space for free speech, for debate, for enthusiastic back and forth, and not label anything that is critical of one stream of thought as anti-national, and not patriotic, and you know FIRs against journalists. This is not just bad for our country internally, but also looks very bad outside and makes us less central to the emerging coalitions that are going to be important in the world, certainly over the next four years.\n\nNDTV: Actually, in fact the most wonderful thing about post-independent India, compared to other developing countries, has been our freedom, our freedom of speech. And it has led to our younger generation, youngsters like you, now with democracy in their very DNA, they question everything, I think they question too much actually. But our great freedom has always made us feel so proud. It is the essence of India, isn't it?\n\nProf Raghuram Rajan: It does. And what sets the government on the right course, is criticism. Constructive criticism, by all means, but criticism is important. Because then you learn from your mistakes, and you then straighten out. The government doesn't have information about everything that's going on. It acquires that information from the critics who say, look, this is getting problematic. That's a mess. And so, we need a government that continues to welcome criticism. Again, it's good that the criticism should be constructive, but sometimes you can't control it, by all means, let it be. That was India, that could be India again. We need to work a little bit on making it happen.\n\nNDTV: So, once again, since you're based in the heart of western debate and opinion, is the world noticing a change in India?\n\nProf Raghuram Rajan: For sure. Look, I read the most respectable newspapers here, the New York Times, The Economist, Financial Times. Of course, there's a tendency in India sometimes to dismiss it. Oh, these are biased, it's hard to argue that Democrats are biased against India. Democrats cherish India. And the New York Times is largely a Democratic paper. But for the New York Times to start having article after article, now, again, you can argue newspapers look at the dark side, they don't look at the wonderful, positive side and there's a lot that's positive in India happening. But my sense is, we should understand that the mood in the rest of the world towards India is darkening. That the kind of countries that India is sometimes compared with on the democratic front, are not countries we want to be clubbed with. India is better than this. And therefore, we can say it's all about public image, but it's not just public image, it's also that we need to fix the reality. I saw an interview by Hamid Ansari, our former Vice President, just yesterday. I mean, he's a serious Indian, who has concerns. And we should understand that this is something that matters to our people, and matters to our future. We need to fix it.\n\nNDTV: And Kaushik, you have spoken about concerns in the Indian economy even before the crisis induced by the pandemic. In fact, Arvind Subramanian, India's former Chief Economic Advisor, then at Harvard, now returning to India with the Ashoka University, has presented a series of charts on the pre, pre-pandemic slowdown of the Indian economy. He suggests that the slowdown in India actually began 10 years ago. Let's quickly run through Arvind Subramanian's brilliant findings.\n\nTake India's exports for a start. Our export growth is plummeting from 16% and 24%, now down to a very worrying 3%, all this is pre-pandemic. Also, our imports fell from 15% in the Vajpayee government era, and now down to 4% now. Again, this sharp decline happened before the 2020 pandemic.\n\nIndustry and government infrastructure investment have also dropped to the lowest levels of only 2-3% growth per year, so the downward trend began before the pandemic, we can't just say that the Pandemic crisis was the reason for our problems. And even credit and bank loans showed the same decline well before the pandemic, and had fallen to its lowest levels for decades, down to just 4-6%.\n\nSo, we're bringing all these figures out to show that there was, as you have written, a deepening crisis before the pandemic. So, Kaushik, while the pandemic intensified the crisis, exacerbated it, the understandable collapse of our economy happened because of the pandemic. But the real concern is that there was a slowdown in the Indian economy in the kind of decade before the pandemic. So what caused the slowdown in the Indian economy, what caused the slowdown before the pandemic?\n\nProf Kaushik Basu: What is causing it, I'm not 100% sure. But there are writings, political economists, political scientists writing, sociologists writing, simple things in life like trust matters a lot. Everyday life, everything is not written down as a contract. Thousand things we are doing by trust. Once trust begins to erode in society, society gets polarized, not trusting one another, the economic indicators begin to do badly. Francis Fukuyama is the classic work, which points to East Asia's success, because not just economic variables, but East Asia is picking up trust of the kind that you get in Nordic and Scandinavian countries. This is there in East Asia. India, starting from I don't know when, the trust was probably improving.\n\nNDTV: So, Kaushik are you saying that trust and non-economic issues that, like social issues, do have a direct impact on growth rates and poverty levels?\n\nProf Kaushik Basu: India has invested a lot, some will say too prematurely, in building a country where you feel a common identity, just by virtue of being in the country. That was the common identity. That is getting eroded. And, I cannot be completely sure about this. But I'm completely sure that the growth has crashed in a way that no one had expected. There has to be causes for that. And my feeling is, the politics has become so divisive. And here I'm not putting blame. Immediately nowadays, in public debates, you think that the blame is at this person's door or that person's door. I'm not doing that. But we have to recognize that it has become a very divisive politics. And that is probably what is adding to the mismanagement of the economy. There are a couple of things which were pure, simple mistakes and mismanagements. For instance, demonetisation was a very bad economic move. The lockdown, the way it was done, which left somewhere between 15 to 40 million people, actually, from 23 million to 40 million people, I know that data, scattered over the country.\n\nDoing exactly the opposite of a lockdown because they had to find food and survival. Those mismanagements did contribute. But you can correct them. Mistakes happen, you can begin to correct them. The political divisiveness, when trust goes down in society, much harder to correct. I feel we should bring that on the agenda. And we have to reach out to people, that it's in your collective interest to stand together, too little of that happening right now.\n\nNDTV: And I just want to ask you one more thing, the world is changing, you're in America at the moment, you understand first hand what's happening. There's been this huge change in America with Biden coming in, there's talk about, we just said there's talk about a coalition of democracies, by which some imply that China is on one side and democracies on the other. And that is actually really important for India, right? As you just said, India was proud of being a democratic country, where you could say anything, you could argue and freedom matters in India. Do you feel that changing, and in the new kind of post-Trump world, where being a true democracy could carry a premium now, a benefit in the Biden more democratic world? So, in the democratic world is there going to be a kind of face-off, a division, with democracies and the non-democratic world, and should India be aware of this, and should we be happy about it and will that affect us in any way?\n\nProf Kaushik Basu: Very much so. Because, on this we truly took pride in India. You know the time when India became independent, around that one or two decades, a whole host of countries became independent at that time, colonialism was breaking off. But if you see there's only one country with a record, that became independent then, and remained a democracy with complete free speech, is India. There's been hardly any interruption, there was an interruption during the emergency, 1975 to 1977, a two-year interruption. But, basically, India has been a vibrant democracy. You stand up and criticize, and I know that even at G-20 meetings when I used to go, people would say that it is amazing, in our corridor discussions, people would show a lot of respect to India, that you can speak. India is like a rich developed country in terms of that space. And we were also beginning to grow. So there was India's investment in that freedom of space for debate and discussion. The democracy which was vibrant, which makes growth difficult, but it puts growth on a stronger footing. And it had begun to grow. So it was an amazing journey for the country. And maybe at times, I feel we took too much pride in that. That is beginning to, India is eroding on that. I hope people wake up.\n\nNDTV: Are there signs of a global trend of democratic values and norms being eroded?\n\nProf Kaushik Basu: I mean, the United States is a good example of a country today, we are again feeling very buoyant about the United States. That there is a recognition that the US was beginning to turn, but it's turned back. With that, one hopes that this is a signal going out around the world that, to do well in the long run you need the soft power of democracy which India had, the soft power. Prannoy, I may be digressing a bit. Once, I remember in China, I'd gone as an academic years ago. A journalist came to interview me on economic matters and asked, that can you tell me Professor Basu, what's the secret of a soft power? And there was almost an element of envy in the voice that India epitomized soft power, which is a lot of power, its soft power. And that is getting eroded. And it is in our self-interest, collective self-interest, to make sure that that does not erode. And the world, with the United States having turned around a very dangerous corner, hopefully there is a bit of a global rise in this sentiment, that democracy is important.\n\nNDTV: Paul Milgrom, may I ask you a slightly political question? How does America avoid another Trump-like era? You don't have to answer that. But it is worrying for all of us across the world because America has never seemed to be so polarized as it is now. We admired America. And then we were shocked when the people of America voted in a politician like Trump. Now where hatred works. So, the rest of the world is concerned that this could happen to America again. Can the polarisation in America get even worse than now or can it improve?\n\nProf Paul Milgrom: I'm worried too. By the way, this gets back to technology too. I mean, you know, the Trump phenomenon is partly about Twitter, and it's partly about the lack of any single trusted source. Trump has been lying for years and riling up his base with falsehoods and teaching hatred. When I was growing up, we had Walter Cronkite, there was this authoritative newsman who everybody believed, and that told the truth. And now there's nobody we believe, and anybody can put on anything. And Trump was spreading all this stuff on Twitter. I think to bring the country together again, we really have to find a way to have somebody who's trusted and a way to clamp down on lies and falsehoods and hatred, which tear people apart and create this polarization. But I don't know how we're going to do that.\n\nNDTV: Okay moving on now to a completely separate topic, which is very exciting, the new world of cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, which are actually designed to exclude the control of any government or any powerful authority. They are completely autonomous and a law unto themselves. Ruchir Sharma pointed out to us that there is a kind of generational divide regarding Bitcoin and attitudes to Bitcoin. Nearly 30% of our younger generation have invested in Bitcoins, while for the elder generation less than 3% have invested in Bitcoin. That is a big difference.\n\nSo, is Bitcoin a serious phenomenon and could it even be a future currency, or is it just a bubble?\n\nRaghuram Rajan, there is this whole question of Bitcoin being a bubble, or possibly could be the currency of the future, which side do you lean on?\n\nProf Raghuram Rajan: Well, so, I think there are two versions of bubble. One is a pure bubble, which is what the economist version is, is something which is valued only because other people value it. There is no fundamental baseline value. I mean, think of Bitcoin. It's very hard to even spend Bitcoin, remember we're spending a nation's worth of energy to try and keep track of Bitcoin, right? It's a very inefficient asset. The amount of computing power that has to go on to maintain Bitcoin transactions is huge. So, in the longer run, it doesn't seem to me that this is a viable means of transacting, means of payment. If you take away the means of payment from Bitcoin, it really is an asset with no intrinsic value. It's a digital asset, which has claims on nothing. So, people value Bitcoin, only because other people value Bitcoin. When Elon Musk tweets positively about Bitcoin, Bitcoin values go up. But it's not as if there's some nirvana down the line when Bitcoin will become the means of payment everywhere. In fact, it's sort of programmed not to become that. So, this leads to the question, why are people valuing Bitcoin? I mean, the reason is, they are valuing it because others are valuing it. And that is part of the reason why it's volatile. One day, Elon Musk tweets, it goes up in value. Another day, somebody says this is heading towards disaster, and it falls. Now, there are some financial assets like that, some of the high-tech companies, which aren't producing anything right now, maybe of that kind. But broadly I would say that asset prices are high. I wouldn't say it's a bubble everywhere. I think there are, certainly in every country, a fair number of assets, which are fairly priced. But low interest rates are lifting everything, perhaps some beyond what their true value is.\n\nNDTV: Paul Milgrom, there are so many pluses and negatives about cryptocurrencies. How should an average person understand and assess the role of these cryptocurrencies in savings and investment decisions that every household takes? You know the economies of countries across the world are diving downwards, but the stock market is shooting up, and Bitcoin is rocketing. It's like the Russian Sputnik vaccine.\n\nProf Paul Milgrom: It's a rocket ship.\n\nNDTV: Explain that.\n\nProf Paul Milgrom: Well so, you're talking specifically about Bitcoin mostly, I think, which 10 years ago was what, $25. And now it's what's $50,000 - $60,000. I don't know. I haven't looked in the last few days. It's just incredible. What's happened to the values and it's also very hard to grapple with because I think that there's a lot of risk associated with it. People are investing in blockchain because it has some unique attributes, very easy to transact. The government can't confiscate it from you. People who are worried about that, like to invest in it, it provides a hedge against monetary inflation when governments are doing their monetary, all those things are reasons to invest. And yet, it would seem so easy to create substitutes. There are other cryptocurrencies that people are creating and if they catch on, then why would you put your money in blockchain, which is so expensive. What is the foundation for the value? It's a kind of fiat currency. It's something that's valuable only because other people say it's valuable. It doesn't have any inherent value of its own. So, we'll see. I think one of the things that's driving blockchain up is the fear of missing out. People are thinking, Oh, my God, it's shooting up. I should get some just in case it continues to go up and that's it. And the demand is feeding on itself, but that's bubble type demand. It could collapse again if people back away from that.\n\nNDTV: Yes. FOMO, the fear of missing out.\n\nProf Paul Milgrom: FOMO, yes. Fear of Missing Out.\n\nNDTV: So, what would you advise an average person to do, invest in Bitcoin or not? Number one, and number two, what would you advise a government, say like the Indian government, should governments allow Bitcoin, blockchain freely or try and have tight controls and ban it?\n\nProf Paul Milgrom: So, I think tight controls are pretty much impossible. I think that one of the appeals of blockchain, one of the reasons people invest in it, is they think that it's very, very hard for you, you have your wallet, your blockchain wallet, your secret passwords, nobody can see what you're doing. And, without blocking access to the whole internet, it's just very hard to control blockchain. For the average person, I think that there is this FOMO thing. People have some fear of missing out, but I think investing too much in it is extremely risky. I think we're talking about it really looks like a bubble to me right now and bubbles eventually break. People make money during bubbles too. And if you, if you have that fear of missing out, and you want to invest, invest a little bit, but don't overdo it. Because you could have your whole asset wiped out. We see the same thing with the GameStop. You know, the GameStop shares. We had just a bunch of people who decided they were going to drive it up and they did. And so a lot of people made a lot of money. A lot of people are going to lose a lot of money too, is the way it's going to happen.\n\nNDTV: So, the Indian government, like many other governments, is trying to place strong controls on Bitcoin. Now, is that the correct path forward? Or is there a new world, with a new kind of currency and governments should just get used to it and not get involved?\n\nProf Paul Milgrom: First of all, I think that its use as a currency is going to be limited. I think governments can regulate its use as a currency. I think people are using it now more as a store of value. And I don't think that the governments can do very much about that. I think that we should watch it carefully, to make sure that it's not you know just a pump and dump scheme that draws average people in, where they lose a lot of money. I think that we're moving increasingly to electronic payments of all sorts.\n\nI'll tell you a story. I visited Sweden with my wife, you know my wife is Swedish. I went to Sweden and most years when I go to Sweden, the first step I make is at the airport and I get some Swedish currency. But I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it. Last year, I was in Sweden for six weeks. I never got any Swedish currency. I could pay for everything with my iPhone or my Apple watch, I just never needed any currency for six weeks in the country. And it wasn't even inconvenient. I mean, we're all moving toward electronic payments. I think that's just the future. And I think Bitcoin is just one little piece of that whole thing.\n\nNDTV: So now this next issue, that's completely different to what we've been discussing so far, but the issue that hasn't had the degree of attention that it should really have had, that it deserves, and that's the health of our children, that's deteriorating.\n\nKaushik there are some key trends in the Indian economy I would like to show you, as you have done lots of work in these areas. This data, which you are obviously familiar with, is from again another paper by Arvind Subramanian, former Chief Economic Advisor, then with Harvard and now back in India with Ashoka University, he's shown that there are two contradictory trends.\n\nHe's shown that there are some positive signs with improved access by ordinary, poorer people, vulnerable people, especially by women, to government welfare measures. For example, more people are using bank accounts, more women are using bank accounts, there's been a huge increase in gas cylinders for cooking, that women have really appreciated. On top of that many more homes are getting more electricity and the number of homes with toilet facilities has risen, though there's some way still to go on that. All good signs.\n\nArvind Subramanian also points out some really disturbing trends in the data and in what's happening in our country, especially related to child health in India. There's a sharp increase in anaemia, there is little or no reversal in the downward trend of stunting among children, and diarrhoea and acute respiratory syndrome are back on the rise again. These are awful signs. Kaushik in all your work on malnutrition and stunting, can you explain why child illnesses and stunting is so bad still and in fact illnesses are getting worse?\n\nProf Kaushik Basu: Hugely, and that should receive much greater attention Prannoy. The malnutrition figure is suggesting what some people are beginning to talk about, that it's a K-shaped improvement that is taking place. That the top segment is becoming better, it's like the top part of the K and the bottom is becoming worse. And the malnutrition data which has come out, and to me actually that is the biggest worry. And we should focus a lot of attention on that. And that is showing that since malnutrition is not something that the middle-class, upper middle-class, even the lower middle-class suffers, it's the very poor, and India still has a large segment of that. That segment is becoming slightly shorter for that age over the five-year period, I should give that data correctly. For 22 states and Union Territories the data has been given out, not for all over India. Of these 22, 13 states stunting has taken place, which has not happened before. So, stunting is taking place. It is true UP, the biggest state, is not a part of this data. So, unless UP is going in a totally different direction, it is an all India worry. There are a few states which have done better, Bihar surprisingly has done better. Hats off to that. I think Assam has done better. Andhra Pradesh not bad, Sikkim not bad. But the average is loss of height for age, for the below five-year age group, which demographers or health economists call stunting. Stunting becoming higher, greater, means the population becoming more stunted, is a very rare happening, that has happened from 2015 to 2019.\n\nNDTV: So, what are the underlying causes and really the reasons behind this child malnutrition and stunting in our country?\n\nProf Kaushik Basu: Once again, we should immediately begin to dissect this. There is also some data which is suggesting that our sanitation has improved over this period. Cooking fuel, better fuels we are using so pollution is less, so those things are not causing this. So almost certainly the income of the poorest segment has been going down. Even while the country is growing, growth is coming down. But it is still positive growth. The poorer segments are becoming poorer. Inequality has gone up. We have got data from Oxfam, we have got data from, Piketty has analysed this data, inequality is going up. So, what is probably happening is that the poorer segments are becoming poorer, and that is leading to malnutrition, which should not happen for a country like India. With so many strengths, vibrancies, there should not be malnutrition increasing.\n\nNDTV: And the trouble Kaushik is that the media tends to, not only in India but all over the world, tends to and has historically always tended to highlight major sensational events. Suddenly 10,000 people have died, or 5,000 people have died in this earthquake or a flood. But millions die because of malnutrition and millions of children, that, too. But that's not highlighted. Why? Because it's a slow process. It's not sudden. So, if it's sudden you report it. But if it's a much bigger problem, like malnutrition, it doesn't hit the headlines. But in your opinion, is that the biggest concern, malnutrition and child health, looking 10-20 years from now?\n\nProf Kaushik Basu: Absolutely. So, in fact, my future forecast, I will tell you, I think there's going to be an immediate pickup, of course, recovery, India's going to recover. Then it's going to be moderate, slowish growth. After that I'm again worried because of all these factors, what it will do in the long run? But the great rosy story of India, which began somewhere in 2003-2004, and continued for 7-8 years, where the whole world was talking about, that for now seems to be blighted. And, coming back once again to this particular topic, of malnutrition, is something that can do a lot of long run damage. For that, once again, we have to be focused on inequality. I mean, inequality is important. You just don't want the country to grow, because the top segment is growing very, very rapidly, because these kinds of factors will begin to cut into the country's long run growth prospects. And I feel a lot of the attention from here onwards ought to be in these sectors. But for that, once again, I'm going back. The country to stand together, not be as divided, and as you're saying Prannoy also, in analysing data, what you're suggesting, you're not saying, but I am saying, that you also need a bit of an openness. You can't, as soon as a number is pointed out, you don't say that I'm not going to take it seriously because this is ideological. The numbers are not ideological. So, we have to look into the numbers in the face. And then say that this is worrying. I can disagree about the cause of it. What you're saying is the cause is not the cause, there's always a dispute. But we must look at the numbers and the numbers are very worrying at this point of time.\n\nNDTV: Michael Kremer, child malnutrition and stunting, some of the major problems facing India. You have studied this area in-depth. What can and what should be done for our children in the distribution of vaccines, which is the more likely future scenario?\n\nProf Michael Kremer: You know our analysis suggests that it's worth it for even the lowest income countries to purchase vaccines. And we did an analysis for Africa and virtually for every country in Africa, it makes sense, COVAX has pledged vaccines for up to 20% of the population. But it makes sense to go beyond that. And so, even for low-income countries, we would advise going out and if necessary, borrowing, to do this. The World Bank has made $12 billion available for financing vaccines, and actually much of that money has not been used. So, I think if I were a finance minister, and even in a very low-income country, let alone a middle-income country, I would think this would be one of the best expenditures that could be made. Now that's not to say that high-income countries don't have obligations. I think high-income countries should be contributing to this as well, through the COVAX facility.\n\nMaybe you know, there'll be technical judgments about which vaccines are best, given the new strains that are coming out. Now, the other aspect is who should purchase this. And there, I think there's an argument for national governments to do that, in some cases. You know, the Government of India may want to do that. There's also a very important role for international organizations. The countries that have already ordered a lot of vaccines, Israel and UAE, US, UK. We're probably going to have a lot of our needs met through existing capacity. But there are many other countries in the world, where it's going to take a long time with existing capacity to vaccinate them. And so, you may need an international body like COVAX to order these vaccines. And then if they solicit bids, you know Indian firms are in a very good position to win those bids. India is really the vaccine manufacturer for the world. And so, of course, it will be important to produce to international standards and so on to do that. But I think both national governments and international organizations should be purchasing.\n\nNDTV: Okay and finally, may I go back to you Professor Milgrom and ask a rather naive question? May I ask you for a moment about your own work, including the work for which you won the Nobel Prize and how it helped you understand not only micro human behaviour, on which it focuses, but is also very relevant for understanding the bigger picture? I mean, the connection between your work and how you can extend it, for us to understand what's going to happen next in the economy.\n\nProf Paul Milgrom: Well, what my work has been used for mainly, at least the work that was cited by the Nobel Committee, has been about designing better markets. We are starting to see lots more designed markets now, when we do markets for roads, as we get self-driving cars, the way that the car-sharing takes place. We see online markets now that are designed for matching, matching people more effectively. So, this isn't so much about the macro economy as about the details of how people are organized. And I'm one of many people who have worked in that area. And this improved efficiency is going to help a lot of people by using resources better, and making resources available more widely to more people because less of it will be wasted.\n\nSo that's the single biggest thing, but you know I'm going to dive away from your question a little bit. Sort of my biggest disappointment about the prize, the work that I'm proudest of, I can't answer your question with it all. A lot of it is really fundamental work about Game Theory, about the role of, you know, when I started working, economics was about supply and demand and conditions of entry, all physical things. And Game Theory says, you know, what people believe is also really important, and what they expect is also really important than driving their behaviour. And the fundamental work that I did in that area is the work that I'm personally proudest of. But it didn't get mentioned at all by the Nobel Committee. And it's not at all useful to you. Maybe that's why, because for somebody like you is saying, what can I predict about the macro economy with it right now. Well, nothing. I can't tell you anything about that. But it's very helpful in other personal situations. Would you like one more story? Can I tell you one more story?\n\nNDTV: Yes, we would love that. Please go ahead.\n\nProf Paul Milgrom: The last story is about when I met my wife, and there's some Game Theory in this story. So, I actually met her at the 1996 Nobel Prize dinner when William Vickery and Jim Mirlees won a prize. I was seated next to her at the dinner, and we had a really pleasant evening, we danced and laughed and talked, and I flew home. I decided I wanted to see her again, but I wasn't sure how. I lived in California. And she lived in Stockholm. And how do you approach somebody like that? And how do you convince somebody like that, that it's worth taking a chance to even date you, when we're so far apart? So, what I decided to do, being the game theorist that I am, is I wrote her a letter and I said, look, I had a really good time and I'd like to see you again. Since you live in Stockholm and I live in California, I'll send you a plane ticket and meet you anywhere in the world. And, that was supposed to get over. You know, I was thinking, she's going to talk to her friends, they are going to tell her there's no future, and I have to do something big enough that it will shut up the friends and her confidantes. So, that was a game theorist's move. And it worked pretty well. We're married now and together for 20 years.\n\nNDTV: Let me tell you, of all the economists that have given examples and lessons, I think for our viewers, that story that you just said, will resonate the most.\n\nWell, that's it for now. Thank you all for being with us for these three Town Hall programme series. Our final Town Hall is a very special interaction with the great Amartya Sen. Don't miss it, it's really very special. Bye for now and thank you again for watching."},

Taxes make up for about 56 per cent of the record high diesel rates.\n\nMs Sitharaman, who had increased central excise duty on petrol and diesel by a record margin last year to mop up gains arising from international oil prices plunging to a two-decade low, remained non-committal on taking the first step to cut central taxes to give relief to consumers.\n\nFor consumers, \"there is enough case to say that prices should be down, it's a burden,\" she said while interacting with journalists at IWPC.\n\nWhile the burden on the consumers is \"understood\", the pricing is a vexatious issue, she said.\n\n\"That's where I use the word ''dharamsankat'',\" she said. \"It is a question which I would like states and the Centre to talk about because it's not just the Centre which has duties on petroleum products, it also has the states charging.\"\n\nStating that both states and the Centre draw revenue out of taxes levied on petrol and diesel, she said 41 per cent of the tax collections made by the Centre go to the states.\n\n\"So there is an issue which is layered and as a result that has to be a matter ideally for the Centre and the states to talk about,\" she added.\n\nOn the issue of bringing petrol and diesel under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, which will end the cascading impact of taxes and bring uniformity, the finance minister said the call has to be taken by the GST Council, the top decision making body of the indirect tax regime.\n\nCurrently, the central government levies a fixed rate of excise duty while states levy different rates of VAT. Under the GST, the two would merge and bring uniformity, solving the problem of fuel rates being higher in states with higher VAT.\n\n\"Whenever the GST Council decides to take up this issue, they are well within their interest to take it up and discuss. It's a call which the Council has to take,\" she said.\n\nAsked if the Centre will take such a proposal to the Council in the next meeting likely this month, she said a call will be taken \"closer to the date of the Council meeting.\"\n\nMs Sitharaman raised excise duty by Rs 13 and Rs 16 per litre on petrol and diesel, respectively, between March 2020 and May 2020 and it now accounts for more than one-third of the Rs 91.17 a litre price of petrol in Delhi and 40 per cent of Rs 81.47 per litre rate of diesel.\n\nEarlier this week, economists at SBI in a report stated that petrol price can go down to Rs 75 a litre across the country if it is brought under the ambit of GST.\n\nDiesel will come at Rs 68 a litre and the revenue loss for the Centre and states will be only Rs 1 lakh crore or 0.4 per cent of GDP, according to the calculation by the economists made under the assumption of global crude prices at USD 60 a barrel and exchange rate at Rs 73 per dollar.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"},

The aim of the index is to accelerate India's urban development and guide evidence-based policymaking. It also works to promote healthy competition among cities. The city that ranked the best with a population of over one million is Bengaluru.\n\nWhile there is no debate on the weather, medical facilities, education and jobs, there is another face of the city which has made the headlines - its often terrible traffic, garbage woes and polluted lakes.\n\nThe civic infrastructure has not kept up pace with the Garden City's rapid growth, giving rise to some cynicism over the ranking. But the criteria considered for the ranking are the reasons why the city made the cut.\n\n\"My first reaction was to chuckle a bit.

Dr Mohan was also the first to confirm that the rover had successfully touched down on the Martian surface after surviving a particularly tricky plunge through the atmosphere of the Red Planet.\n\nDr Mohan, who emigrated from India to the US when she was only a year old, told Biden that her path actually started way back when she was a child, watching the first episode of Star Trek, the popular TV show.\n\n\"In addition to those fantastical scenes of space, what really captured my attention was this really close-knit team which was working together, manipulating this technological marvel with the sole purpose of exploring space and understanding new things and seeking new life,\" Swati Mohan told Joe Biden during a virtual interaction on Thursday.\n\nUS President Biden congratulated the NASA team responsible for the successful landing of the six-wheeled rover on Mars and for giving the country a \"dose of confidence\" at a moment when the nation's reputation as a scientific leader has been tattered by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJoe Biden, speaking during a video conference call with the leadership of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) team led by Dr Michael Watkins, expressed awe over the landing of the Perseverance.\n\nInteracting with Joe Biden, Dr Mohan said: \"You know, Perseverance is my first mission at JPL, where I have gotten to work from the very beginning of formulation, all the way through operations, and it made me feel like I was part of that crew. Being able to work with this incredibly diverse, talented team that has become like a family, spending years creating our own technological marvel has been a privilege.\"\n\n\"Those last days and weeks leading up to landing day, it was pretty smooth, but we were all still really nervous and, frankly, terrified until we got through those final seven minutes.\"\n\nDr Mohan helmed the mission's attitude control system, which helps make sure the spacecraft is heading in the direction it needs to be.\n\n\"To be able to call touchdown safely, to see those first images come back from Mars, to see the place where we have never been able to go to on Mars before and go there -- reach there for the express purpose of seeking out new life just made it feel like I was living in a dream,\" said the Indian-American engineer.\n\n\"Now that tremendous relief has passed for the team of being able to be there safely, all that's left is the excitement and the thrill of all the scientific discoveries that are yet to come and what Perseverance can actually find -- and hopefully find those signs of past life on Mars,\" Dr Mohan said.\n\nShe thanked the US President for speaking to the NASA team. \"Thank you for taking the time to speak with us,\" she said.\n\nJoe Biden said: \"Are you kidding me?

We bring the best out of every single solitary culture in the world here in the United States of America, and we give people an opportunity to let their dreams run forward,\" Joe Biden said.\n\n\"Everyone was so down the last years about: Is America still the -- fount of change? And are we still the country that has hopes and develops and pursues the most unlikely things to happen? And we are. And you all demonstrated it. I really mean this.

Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first, Joe Biden did it on live television, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi's inoculation is being credited with reviving a lackluster rollout.\n\nBut despite being one of the first countries in the world to authorize vaccines for use, China has said nothing about the vaccination status of its top leaders, who all -- including President Xi Jinping -- appeared without face masks in Beijing Friday, mingling with thousands of delegates from across China at the country's biggest political gathering of the year.\n\nWhile officials seated in the rows behind them were all masked, Xi and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang moved around the Great Hall of the People, where the National People's Congress is opened every year, mask-free. The exception seemed to apply only to members of the Politburo and a handful of other top Communist Party leaders. Xi also went without a mask at last year's NPC, seen as a statement on China's virus success with the Wuhan outbreak largely quelled.\n\nDoes Xi's confidence come from China having all but eliminated Covid-19, or has he received one of the four shots now authorized for general use? Most of the delegates in the Great Hall were probably vaccinated, with state media reporting this week that more than 5,000 of those flocking to Beijing for the so-called twin sessions had been inoculated against the coronavirus.\n\nThe mystery around Xi and other top leaders' vaccination status comes as China struggles to ramp up its inoculation drive. The country pushed back by two months a plan to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year holiday in February, as concerns about supply and hesitancy around the efficacy and safety of locally-produced shots complicated efforts.\n\nWhile its outbreak is under control, China is way behind the U.S. on vaccinating, according to Bloomberg's global vaccine tracker. At the current pace it will be more than nine years before 75% of its vast population is immunized, versus six months for the U.S. Government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said this week China plans to vaccinate 40% of its 1.4 billion citizens by the end of June, a mammoth undertaking given it's only now at 3.5%.\n\nEven if they had been vaccinated, a political leader appearing in public without a mask in other parts of the world right now would likely trigger a public outcry. At Biden's inauguration in January, the incoming president and other senior attendees, including the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and former presidents, all wore masks through hours of festivities. Biden was vaccinated with the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE shot on Dec. 21.\n\nUS President Joe Biden receives the second course of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Delaware, in January administered by Chief Nurse Executive Ric Cuming.\n\nU.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Indonesia's leader, Joko Widodo -- who received a Chinese vaccine by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. -- all got shots for the cameras as a way of encouraging people to get vaccinated. Hong Kong's Chief Executive Carrie Lam got the Sinovac shot at a public event in late February.\n\nIn January, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had taken the vaccine, a revelation that had yet to be confirmed by authorities in Beijing."},

At a time when climate action is still lagging, 8-10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food that is not consumed, when losses before consumer level are taken into account.\n\n\"Reducing food waste would cut greenhouse gas emissions, slow the destruction of nature through land conversion and pollution, enhance the availability of food and thus reduce hunger and save money at a time of global recession,\" Mr Andersen said.\n\nThe report noted that with 690 million people affected by hunger in 2019, an estimate that is expected to rise sharply due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and three billion people unable to afford a healthy diet, consumers need help to reduce food waste at home.\n\nIt said countries can raise climate ambition by including food waste in Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, while strengthening food security and cutting costs to households.\n\nThis makes food waste prevention also a primary area for inclusion in COVID-19 recovery strategies.\n\n\"For a long time, it was assumed that food waste in the home was a significant problem only in developed countries,\" said Marcus Gover, CEO of WRAP.\n\n\"With the publication of the Food Waste Index report, we see that things are not so clear cut. With only nine years to go, we will not achieve SDG 12 Target 3 if we do not significantly increase investment in tackling food waste in the home globally. This must be a priority for governments, international organisations, businesses and philanthropic foundations,\" Mr Gover said.\n\nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 12.3 aims at halving per-capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels and reducing food losses along production and supply chains. One of the two indicators for the target is the Food Waste Index.\n\nMr Andersen said that there is growing evidence of success in reducing food waste - though not at the scale needed to achieve the target.\n\n\"Much more can be done. We need, for example, to address the role of consumer behaviour, in all cultural contexts, in achieving the target.

(File photo)\n\nHighlights The hike in defence spending was announced by Chinese Premier\n\nChina is the second biggest spender of defence after the US\n\nUS defence budget is USD 740.5 billion for the 2021 fiscal year\n\nChina on Friday hiked its defence budget for the first time to more than USD 200 billion, over three times higher than that of India, maintaining a single-digit growth for the sixth consecutive year with a 6.8 per cent increase in 2021.\n\nThe hike in defence spending was announced by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on the opening day of the National People's Congress, China's Parliament, amidst a military standoff with India in eastern Ladakh and growing political and military tensions with the United States.\n\nThis year's planned defence spending will be about 1.35 trillion yuan (about USD 209 billion), state-run Xinhua news agency reported, adding that the annual defence budget maintains a single-digit growth for a sixth consecutive year.\n\nChina's defence budget is about one quarter of the US figure, which is USD 740.5 billion for the 2021 fiscal year, it said.\n\nFriday's increase is over three times higher than India's defence budget of about USD 65.7 billion (including pensions).\n\nLast year, China allocated 1.268 trillion yuan (about USD 196.44 billion), according to the state-run Global Times.\n\nIn his 35-page work report outlining China's achievements in 2020 and tasks for 2021, premier Li described last year as a \"major success\" for the armed forces without mentioning China moving over 60,000 well-armed troops who were mobilised for annual exercises, to contentious areas like Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh, prompting India to match the People''s Liberation Army's (PLA) mobilisation which led to an over eight-month long standoff.\n\nAfter lengthy rounds of talks, the two sides simultaneously withdrew troops from Pangong Tso area while talks are on for the withdrawal of troops from the rest of the areas.\n\n\"Last year, major success was attained in the development of national defence and the armed forces. Our people''s forces, with complete competence and fine conduct, safeguarded China''s national security and participated in epidemic control,\" Li said in his work report.\n\nHe also asserted that \"absolute leadership\" over the two million-strong PLA, the largest in the world, will be vested with the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) and its \"core leader\" and President Xi Jinping who heads the all-powerful Central Military Commission (CMC), the overall high command of the PLA.\n\n\"This year, we will thoroughly implement Xi Jinping''s thinking on strengthening the armed forces and the military strategy for the new era, ensure the Party''s absolute leadership over the people''s armed forces, and strictly implement the system of ultimate responsibility resting with the chairman of the Central Military Commission.\n\n\"We will, bearing in mind the goals set for the centenary of the People''s Liberation Army, continue to enhance the political loyalty of the armed forces, strengthen them through reform, science and technology and the training of capable personnel, and run them in accordance with the law,\" he said.\n\nLi said to boost military training and preparedness across the board, make overall plans for responding to security risks in all areas and for all situations, and enhance the military''s strategic capacity to protect the sovereignty, security and development interests of the country.\n\n\"We will improve the layout of defence-related science, technology and industry, and enhance the defence mobilisation system.\n\n\"We in government at all levels should vigorously support the development of national defence and the armed forces, and conduct extensive activities to promote mutual support between the civilians and the military, so as to forge an ever-closer bond between the people and the military in the new era,\" the premier said.\n\nThe increase of the defence budget, amid massive expansion of the military hardware, including building of more aircraft carriers in addition to the two newly-built ones, also comes amidst the increasing tensions between China and the US over Taiwan and the South China Sea (SCS) besides growing discord between the two over Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong.\n\nLast year, a key conclave of the CPC had finalised plans to build a fully modern military on par with the United States by 2027, which is also the centenary year of the PLA.\n\nThe PLA this year has also announced a 40 per cent increase in salaries to attract more talent.\n\nChina is the second biggest spender of defence after the US.\n\nDefending the increase in defence budget, Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for the NPC, told the media here that China's efforts to strengthen the national defence do not target or threaten any country.\n\nWhether a country poses a threat to others depends on what kind of defence policy it pursues, he said, adding that China is committed to the path of peaceful development and adheres to a defence policy that is defensive in nature.\n\nAs the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, China's planned defence spending per capita in 2021 will be less than 1,000 yuan (USD 154), the Xinhua report said.\n\nChina applies strict mechanisms of fiscal allocation and budget management on its defence expenditure, which is mainly assigned to personnel, training and sustainment, and equipment, it said.\n\nChina has voluntarily downsized its armed forces by over four million troops since 1978, according to a white paper released in 2019.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"},
{"headline": "Antibodies, Vaccines Less Effective Against Coronavirus Variants: Study", "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/antibodies-vaccines-less-effective-against-coronavirus-variants-study-2384204", "article": "The scientists call for continuous testing of the ability of antibodies to work against new variants.\n\nCOVID-19 antibody-based drugs and vaccines developed so far may become less effective as new variants of the novel coronavirus spread widely, according to a new study.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, noted that the three fast-spreading variants of the coronavirus first reported in South Africa, the UK and Brazil, can evade antibodies that work against the original form of the virus that sparked the pandemic.\n\nAccording to the scientists, including those from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis in the US, more of antibodies produced in response to vaccination or natural infection, or purified antibodies intended for use as drugs, is needed to neutralise these novel coronavirus varieties, compared to the levels needed to counter the original virus lineage from Wuhan, China.\n\n\"We're concerned that people whom we'd expect to have a protective level of antibodies because they have had COVID-19 or been vaccinated against it, might not be protected against the new variants,\" said study senior author Michael S. Diamond from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.\n\nThe researchers said there is wide variation in how much antibody a person produces in response to vaccination or natural infection.\n\n\"Some people produce very high levels, and they would still likely be protected against the new, worrisome variants. But some people, especially older and immunocompromised people, may not make such high levels of antibodies,\" Diamond said.\n\n\"If the level of antibody needed for protection goes up tenfold, as our data indicate it does, they may not have enough. The concern is that the people who need protection the most are the ones least likely to have it,\" he added.\n\nAccording to the researchers, people infected with the coronavirus generate the most protective antibodies against the virus spike protein which enables it to enter host cells.\n\nOver the course of the pandemic, the scientists said neutralising the spike protein became an widely used strategy for developing antibody-based drugs against the coronavirus as well as in vaccine development.\n\nWhile for nearly a year the mutations that arose in the virus did not threaten this spike-based strategy, the scientists said fast-spreading variants detected in the UK, South Africa, Brazil and elsewhere carried multiple alterations in their spike genes that could lessen the effectiveness of spike-targeted drugs and vaccines.\n\nThey said the most worrisome new variants were B.1.1.7 from the UK, B.1.135 from South Africa, and B.1.1.248, also known as P.1, first reported in Brazil.\n\nIn the current research, the scientists tested the ability of antibodies to neutralise three virus variants in the laboratory.\n\nThey tested the variants against antibodies in the blood of people who had recovered from the coronavirus infection or were vaccinated with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe researchers also tested antibodies in the blood of mice, hamsters and monkeys that had been vaccinated with an experimental COVID-19 vaccine, developed at Washington University School of Medicine, that can be given through the nose.\n\nAccording to the study, the B.1.1.7 variant could be neutralised with similar levels of antibodies as were needed to neutralise the original virus, but the other two variants required from 3.5 to 10 times as much antibody for neutralization.\n\nWhen the researchers tested the new viral variants against a panel of mass-produced replicas of individual antibodies called monoclonal antibodies, the results ranged from broadly effective to completely ineffective.\n\nThey said most of the variation in antibody effectiveness could be attributed to a change in a single amino acid building block that makes up the spike protein.\n\nThis change, called E484K, was found in the South African and Brazilian variants, but not in the one from UK, the study noted.\n\n\"We don't exactly know what the consequences of these new variants are going to be yet,\" said Diamond.\n\n\"Antibodies are not the only measure of protection; other elements of the immune system may be able to compensate for increased resistance to antibodies. That's going to be determined over time, epidemiologically, as we see what happens as these variants spread,\" he added.\n\nThe scientists call for continuous testing of the ability of antibodies to work against new variants to potentially adjust vaccines and antibody-treatment strategies.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"},

(Representational)\n\nA few months back, it seemed as if the coronavirus pandemic would kill off presenteeism -- you know, showing up at work with a sniffle or cough to prove your value or ensure you get your paycheck. Companies that didn't offer paid sick leave were sure to wise up, realizing it was madness to create incentives for workers to spread germs on the job, and Type A workaholics would see that putting the entire office at risk of infection is more selfish than selfless. As it turns out, presenteeism just got a new address: the kitchen table. \"You're expected to be always accessible, because where else could you be?\" says Harvard Business School professor Leslie Perlow. \"There's nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.\"\n\nEven before the Covid-19 pandemic, remote work had started to chip away at sick days. Slack messages saying \"I've got a cold brewing, so I'll work from home today\" were already replacing \"Hey, boss [cough, cough], I need a sick day\" phone calls. A 2014 Stanford University study found that call center employees who worked from home put in more days, because they stayed on the job at times they would have been too ill to come to the office. And the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last year found that people with flu symptoms were more likely to work if they had the option to do so from home. \"When everything happens in the same place, you no longer have that geographic boundary\" between work and home, says Barbara Larson, a business professor at Northeastern University.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says 1 in 4 companies adopted more generous sick leave policies last spring as the coronavirus spread. But instead of taking advantage of those rules, many ailing employees simply continued to toil away at a zombie pace from the couch: A survey conducted by OnePoll on behalf of a cold remedy, ColdCalm, found that half of the 2,000 respondents had quietly taken partial sick days during the pandemic -- without telling their boss -- and 7 in 10 said they'd worked while feeling under the weather.\n\nRemote work means people are less exposed to the germs that cause colds. That, plus social distancing, hand-washing, and mask-wearing, has sent flu infections plummeting this winter. And some of the current hesitation to ask for time off may be because the seriousness of Covid-19 has shifted the definition of what it means to be sick. With images of people dying on ventilators making sore throats seem trivial, many workers fear bosses would disapprove of a sick day for anything less than Covid. \"If you actually call in sick, of course everybody's first question is, 'Is it Covid?' \" Larson says. \"People are reluctant to self-identify as sick right now.\"\n\nBut it's not only contagious illnesses that might require a sick day: Including ailments such as back pain, allergies, or depression, \"95% of us suffer from something,\" says Ron Goetzel, director of the Institute for Health and Productivity Studies at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He estimates that lower productivity from workers who show up when sick costs employers twice as much as treating those conditions would. Migraines alone led to losses of $45 billion a year in the U.S. and Europe, according to the Harvard Business Review, and almost 90% of that stems from presenteeism.\n\nResearchers who study cognition have found that being sick impairs brain function as much as drinking alcohol or pulling an all-nighter. These risks are probably even greater for the knowledge workers who find it easiest to work remotely, because their jobs are all about brainpower. Nonetheless, employees shouldn't be forced to take days off if they feel they can be productive for at least part of the day, says David Burkus, author of Leading From Anywhere: The Essential Guide to Managing Remote Teams.\n\nFor salaried workers paid to achieve goals, not put in a certain number of hours, working more flexibly is reasonable -- as long as they inform colleagues of their availability. \"Remote work pushes a lot of things down to the level of team culture, as opposed to organizational culture,\" says Burkus, a former management professor who conducts training courses for managers of remote teams (remotely, of course). It can be tough for workplaces to reach that level of trust, putting the onus on managers to lead by example, broadcasting when they'll be offline and why -- be it for a child-care emergency, the flu, or just a needed break. \"We've known for a long time that time away from work makes work better,\" Burkus says. \"I'm fully supportive of mental health days.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"},

This means that PLI schemes will lead to production worth USD 520 billion in India in the next five years,\" he said.\n\nPM Modi said that over the past 6-7 years, several successful efforts have been made to encourage \"Make in India\" at different levels.\n\nHe stressed on the need to take a big leap, as well as increase the speed and scale to boost manufacturing as it would increase employment generation in the country.\n\nThe Prime Minister said the government is working at every level to promote the industry through measures like ease of doing business, reducing the compliance burden, creating multi-modal infrastructure to reduce logistics costs, and constructing district-level export hubs.\n\n\"Our effort is to reduce over 6,000 compliance burden (for industry),\" he said.\n\nThe government, he said, believes that its interference in everything creates more problems than solutions and \"therefore, self-regulation, self-attesting, self-certification are being emphasised\".\n\n\"We have to attract cutting-edge technology and maximum investment in the sectors related to our core competency,\" he added.\n\nUnderlining the difference between the earlier schemes and those of the current government, the Prime Minister said that earlier industrial incentives used to be open ended input-based subsidies, now they have been made targeted and performance based through a competitive process.\n\nAbout PLI benefits, he said 13 sectors have been brought under the ambit of the scheme and it would benefit the entire ecosystem associated with these sectors.\n\n\"With PLI in auto and pharma, there will be very less foreign dependence related to auto parts, medical equipment and raw materials of medicines.

Last year, Pfizer scaled back its production targets after the U.S. drugmaker ran into difficulties securing all the materials it needs to produce the vaccines at a large scale, a reminder that the world is depending on mass manufacturing at an unprecedented speed and scale to end the pandemic.\n\n\"This is one thing that would need some discussion with the Biden administration to explain to them there's enough to go around,\" Poonawalla said. \"We're talking about having free global access to vaccines but if we can't get the raw materials out of the U.S. -- that's going to be a serious limiting factor.\"\n\nEven under ideal conditions, getting injections into the arms of 7.8 billion people would test the delicate choreography of the world's supply chains in ways unseen in peacetime. That's because producing a vaccine relies on a complex global value chain of raw materials and components.\n\n\"There is a shortage of materials, of products that you need for the manufacturing of vaccines,\" said Swaminathan. \"This is where again you need global agreement and coordination not to do export bans.\"\n\nShe said the WHO's vaccine partners, the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations and the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers Network, will hold meetings on Monday and Tuesday next week to discuss those issues.\n\nDespite Poonawalla's warnings, he said that Serum had in the past two months distributed 90 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine to 51 countries after it was granted emergency authorization by Indian regulators in early January -- a record pace for the company.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"},

Ranipa has been charged under provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act.\n\nThe applicants advocate, Mandar Soman, argued that the IPC sections under which Ranipa has been charged are bailable.\n\nHowever, the sections of the Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act invoked in the case are punishable up to three years in jail.\n\nSoman argued that under the two Acts, the punishment can be a minimum of six months which may extend to three years and hence it is bailable.\n\nAdvocate Aniket Nikam, appointed by the HC as an amicus curiae (to assist the court) in the case, however, argued that the offences in which sentence imposed can extend up to three years will be non-bailable in nature.\n\nAn offence will be bailable only when the sentence of that offence is less than three years. But when a particular Act provides for the punishment to be up to three years then it becomes non-bailable in nature, he argued.\n\nThe court, in its order, noted that if the offences in any other law, except the IPC, are punishable with imprisonment for three years and upwards then the offences are cognizable and non-bailable.\n\nReferring to Schedule I part II of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), Justice Kotwal said, Wherever it is possible to impose the punishment extending to three years, this category would apply, because in such offences it is possible to impose a sentence of exactly three years. In such cases, offences would be non-bailable.\n\nAs per the CrPC provision, if any offence under a law, other than the IPC, is punishable with imprisonment for three years then it is cognizable and non-bailable.\n\nThe court, while rejecting Ranipa's application, noted that a case under the Copyright Act and Trade Marks Act was clearly made out against him.\n\nIn cognizable offences, police can arrest a suspect in a case without seeking a courts warrant to do so and can start an investigation on its own.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"},

The organisation behind the development, expected to be close to the size of Belgium when it is completed, will hire 700 people this year, according to Simon Ainslie, the venture's chief operating officer.\n\nWhile NEOM is being sold as a vision of a brighter future, international investors have yet to bite.\n\nThe scale of the project is vast and the region already has well-established transport and business hubs in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Qatar. The development is also inextricably linked to the Crown Prince, who as de facto leader of the kingdom has drawn ire over Saudi's war in Yemen and his own alleged links to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nA U.S. intelligence report released last week concluded the prince approved an operation to \"capture or kill\" Khashoggi, who had criticised Saudi policies in columns for the Washington Post. Saudi officials deny this and have rejected the report's findings.\n\nAnalysts say the report is unlikely to change investor sentiment towards Saudi Arabia in the absence of U.S. action against the prince.\n\n\"They had expected sort of a bigger push back from the (Biden) administration but if this is it then the signal is fairly weak,\" said Neil Quilliam, managing director at Azure Strategy, a Middle East-focused consultancy\n\n\"So I don't see this as being a major impediment to most companies seeking opportunities in the kingdom.\"\n\nQuilliam said there was some skepticism about so-called 'giga projects', citing the King Abdullah Economic City project in the early 2000s, that never really took off.\n\nThe Saudi government's media office and NEOM did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the status of NEOM in the wake of the U.S. report.\n\nBefore the report was released, NEOM said that the project had attracted domestic and international interest.\n\n\"NEOM is in discussions with several companies across diverse industries that are keen to be involved,\" it said in a statement.\n\nNEOM was publicly launched in 2017 but large-scale construction of the city has yet to begin. The project currently employs over 750 people, 500 of them hired last year.\n\nThe murder of Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul in 2018 had already caused an international outcry prompting some people at the time to withdraw from the advisory board of NEOM.\n\nThe list of current members is not publicly available and NEOM declined to say who sits on it.\n\nCOGNITIVE CITY\n\nFunding for NEOM will initially come from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, according to two financial sources close to the matter.\n\n\"Investors will start getting interested when the core infrastructure is operating so they are not taking absolute green-field risk,\" said a financial source familiar with the project.\n\nIn 2017, Softbank Group CEO Masayoshi Son said the company would work with Saudi Arabia on the development of NEOM.\n\nSoftbank and Son did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on what their current investment plans are for NEOM.\n\nThe Saudi sovereign fund PIF has invested around $45 billion in Softbank's inaugural $100 billion technology fund.\n\nThe PIF said in an email that its role on major projects was to act as a long-term cornerstone investor to ensure \"that capital allocated to all its projects, including NEOM, generate sustainable returns that generate long-term shareholder value\".\n\nNEOM's flagship zero-carbon project \"The Line\" envisages a city of 1 million people run by smart technology with facial recognition and 5G networks as standard.\n\n\"We're fundamentally building the world's first cognitive city,\" Joseph Bradley, NEOM's head of technology and digital and a former CISCO executive, told Reuters, adding that an operating system known as NEOS aimed to seek consent to use data from 90% of residents.\n\nThis year's hiring spree will span a range of professions from lawyers, accountants and engineers, to specialist areas such as advanced robotics and adventure sports, according to Ainslie, who was hired in 2019 from Microsoft Corp\n\nNEOM officials say building would start soon on 'The Line', a car-free, road-free city within NEOM, without specifying a date.\n\nNEOM said in a statement that work had begun on surveys and temporary infrastructure, and that permanent works would start this year with the first phase to be completed by 2025.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"},

(File)\n\nA Delhi Court on Thursday dismissed the Enforcement Directorate's plea for cancellation of bail granted to the accused Gautam Khaitan in AgustaWestland money laundering case.\n\nSpecial Judge Arvind Kumar while passing the order noted that the alleged act raised by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on the part of the accused Gautam Khaitan is not so serious as to warrant the cancellation of bail of the accused. However, the court imposed several more bail conditions on Khaitan.\n\n\"However, some further conditions need to be imposed on accused to avoid any chance of tampering of evidence or influencing the witnesses. The accused shall report to the ED office once a week. He shall not contact any witness of this case particularly Pareen Khan. It is made clear that the aforesaid conduct of the accused shall be considered, also at the time of considering the request of the accused for the permission to travel abroad, if made,\" the court said in the order.\n\nThe ED contended that the accused Gautam Khaitan had tried to mislead the investigating agency in as much as in his statement recorded in 2014 he failed to recognise Pareen Khan, however, in the year 2017-2018 he mentioned her to be a family friend of the accused of more than 30 years and tried to avoid joining investigation on the excuse of paucity of time from December 18, 2019 to December 21, 2019, in order to avoid confrontation with the witness namely Pareen Khan who was in India to join the investigation.\n\nThe ED further said that other than meeting Pareen Khan personally, the accused has been contacting her regularly either through Whatsapp messages or through alternate mobile numbers.\n\nIt is submitted that accused has been instructing the witness to delete the chat messages and has been deleting the same from his own mobile phone.\n\nThe ED also submitted that the accused kept on projecting a wrong picture of the investigation and kept telling Pareen Khan to not come to India to join the investigation.\n\nThe ED also contended that the accused Gautam Khaitan had made all possible attempts to derail the investigation and not let the said witness join the investigation and asked her to destroy the Whatsapp chat. Accused Gautam Khaitan had further tutored her for presumable questions of the investigation in case of any eventuality.\n\nMeanwhile, senior Advocate Siddharth Luthra and Advocate Pramod Luthra who represented Gautam Khaitan submitted that the accused was granted bail on January 9, 2015 after being arrested on September 23, 2014 and has since then cooperated with the investigation and attended all the court hearings in the last five years.\n\nThe lawyers further stated that Pareen Khan had not been cited as a witness in any of the complaints/supplementary complaints filed by the ED.\n\nTherefore, there was no reason for the accused to influence her. It is contended that Pareen Khan had nothing to do with the AgustaWestland controversy, which is the admitted case of the ED.\n\nAccording to the ED, the accused Gautam Khaitan is involved in laundering proceeds of crime and there is sufficient evidence against him that he had floated and used various shell companies in his name and in the name of his clients to launder the proceeds of crime arising out of 12 VVIP helicopter deals between the Government of India and AgustaWestland.\n\nThe AgustaWestland case is an alleged case of corruption that is being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the ED. It has been alleged that bribes were paid during the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime to \"middlemen\", perhaps even politicians, when India agreed to buy 12 AgustaWestland helicopters built by an Italian defence manufacturing Company Finmeccanica at an estimated cost of Rs 3,600 crore. Later in 2014, the said deal was scrapped by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government."},
