While the polling was dull in the first few hours in the morning, it slowly picked up in the day. But, most polling stations had very less voter turnout in the afternoon as the voters avoided the scorching sun.\n\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) candidate for Tirupparankundram assembly constituency S. Ponnuthai and her supporters staged a road roko near APT Duraisamy Nadar Higher Secondary School at Anuppanadi in the evening alleging that the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) candidate had distributed tokens to canvass voters, who will be paid in cash in return for their votes. She demanded to take action against the contestant and the party cadre.\n\nThere was a technical glitch in the Electronic Voting Machine (EVMs) at a booth in Appar Higher Secondary School at Karuppayurani of Madurai East constituency. This caused a delay and polling commenced only at 8.45 a.m. Partymen of various political parties were seen canvassing votes within the campus of the Appar Higher Secondary School, in violation of the norms.\n\nAt most of the polling booths, the Polling officers did not ask the voters to remove their facemask to verify their identity. A party booth agent complained that this created a confusion as they found it difficult to verify the identity of the voters.\n\nThe Caste Hindu residents of Ulaipatti and Soolapuram villages of Usilampatti assembly constituency had boycotted the polls as the district election officials did not meet their demand of setting a separate polling booth for them.\n\nK. V. Rajkumar, Returning Officer of Usilampatti assembly constituency, said that due to a recent clash between the Scheduled Caste and Caste Hindu residents, the Caste Hindu residents had demanded a separate polling booth.\n\n\u201cHowever, we denied setting up a separate booth,\u201d he said. On the other hand, caste volatile areas like Pappapatti and Keeripatti of Usilampatti constituency witnessed smooth polling without any incidents.\n\nAt most of the polling stations, there were poor arrangements made for the elderly and differently-abled voters.P. Panchavarnam, a crawling differently-abled person, faced difficulty as she had to crawl all the way through the ramp to enter a polling booth at Government Higher Secondary School, Karungalakudi, of Melur assembly constituency.\n\nAdherence to COVID-19 protocol was poor in most of the polling stations. The public had disposed of the polythene hand gloves in open places after casting their votes.", "cat": "Madurai"},

Polling was peaceful and largely incident-free, barring minor technical snags in Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) at a few polling booths, Mr. Sukumar said. The machines were promptly replaced and voting continued uninterrupted.\n\nDespite the COVID-19 threat, voters, including tribespeople and plantation workers, turned out in large numbers in the early morning and formed long queues outside polling booths in various parts of the district.\n\nElaborate security arrangements had been made by the police for the smooth conduct of elections. Paramilitary and police forces were deployed in 124 booths which were identified as Left Wing Extremists (LWE) affected booths and three-level security measures were in place in these booths.\n\nIn Mananthavady, former minister and UDF candidate P.K.

Moreover, the tight vigil maintained by polling officials and additional preventive measures introduced by the Election Commission appeared to have paid off.\n\n\u201cOur officials had put in a lot of hard work and came out with a mechanism to prevent bogus voting, which was approved by the High Court and the Election Commission.

At Mananthavady, Vypeen, and Parassala, some voters reportedly found that their votes had already been cast beforehand in the form of postal votes. Reportedly, these voters had never applied for postal ballots.\n\nIn the run-up to the elections, it was Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala who flagged the issue, claiming that over four lakh 'fake' voters were present on the rolls. Both the UDF and the Bharatiya Janata Party had lodged complaints with the commission. On March 30, the commission informed the Kerala High Court that it could detect only 38,586 demographically similar entries in the rolls.\n\nSubsequently, acting on a court directive, the ECI had introduced measures such as capturing the fingerprint and photographs of voters on the \u2018absent, shifted dead/duplicate\u2019 (ASD) list supplied to the presiding officers to prevent multiple voting and impersonation.\n\nVoters on this list were also required to give a declaration to polling officials.

It is based on the Vedas and the Divya Prabandham, and therein lies its appeal. If sugarcane and cane juice were both offered to us, would we not prefer the latter? Chewing the cane is cumbersome, and if we can get its sweetness in the form of an extract, we will, naturally, go for it. In the same way, Koortaazhvan\u2019s work scores by giving us the substance of all sacred literature, said P.B. Rajahamsam in a discourse.\n\nKooratazhvan refers to Lord Varadaraja as nissama, which means none is equal to Him. But Kooratazhvan also uses the word abyadhikam while praising Varadaraja. This means there is none superior to Him either. A similar sentiment is expressed by Nammazhvar when he talks about Oppiliappan, the deity of a temple near Kumbakonam. When He took the Trivikrama avatara, the Lord measured all the worlds. What more proof is needed of His Supremacy?\n\nIn verse two of Varadaraja stava, Kooratazhvan refers to Lord Varadaraja as Srinidhim nidhim. Why did he use the word \u2018nidhim\u2019 in succession? It is not to be seen as a repetition, but as a meaningful and necessary praise of the Lord and His Consort. Srinidhim shows the inseparability of the Divine Couple. It is futile to think of One without the Other. She is the One who brings us close to Him. She gives us the confidence that He will save us. She convinces Him that He should overlook our faults and grant us the refuge of His feet. She guides the seeker to mend his ways. She coaxes the Lord to forgive us. She reminds Him of His qualities of daya and kshama, for with such qualities, how can He be unforgiving of our blemishes? If He is unresponsive to Her pleas, She uses Her charm to bring Him round.", "cat": "Faith"},

Shivakumar from income tax evasion case.\n\n\u201cThese allegations, even if accepted as true, do not prima facie constitute offences under section 276C(1) of the Income Tax Act,\u201d the court observed while ruling that \u201cthe very prosecution launched against the respondent [Mr. Shivakumar] being premature and illegal, cannot be allowed to continue.\u201d\n\nThe High Court also said that \u201cthe allegations made in the complaints and the material produced in support there of prima facie do not make out the ingredients of the offences under section 276C(1) of the I-Tax Act.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, the High Court also held that that I-T Department could not have filed its complaint against Mr. Shivakumar under Section 276C of the I-T Act before the Special Court for Economic Offences as the law mandates filling of complaint only before the jurisdictional magistrate.\n\nIn usual course, the I-T Department regularly lodges complaints of I-T evasion before the Special Court for Economic Offences, which orders for issuance of summons to the accused persons if it accepts the complaint filed by the department\u2019s authorised officers.\n\nIn Mr. Shivakumar\u2019s case, the Special Court for Economic Offence had on February 14, 2018, issued summons to him on the department\u2019s complaint, and after a year, the case was transferred to the Special Court set up to exclusively deal with criminal cases against MPs and MLAs in Karnataka, which had discharged him from the case.\n\nThough the High Court upheld the Special Court\u2019s order of discharging Mr. Shivakumar, it did not agree with the latter\u2019s finding that Deputy Director, I-T Investigations, who was the authorised officer to conduct the searches, had no jurisdiction to estimate the undisclosed income, interest and penalty payable by Mr. Shivakumar.\n\nThe case was initiated against Mr. Shivakumar based on financial transactions that he had scribbled on a sheet of paper that he tore during search conducted at a resort on the outskirts of the city during August 2017, and the department had alleged evasion of tax to the tune of \u20b913 crore spread over the assessment years 2015-18.", "cat": "Bengaluru"},

Last year, we had had very few incidents during this period. It led to an excessive fuel load,\u201d he said. Then, he told The Hindu, incidents of winter forest fire were reported from October 2020 onwards because of dry winter which is becoming a norm in Uttarakhand because of climate change.\n\nEnvironmentalists feel the State government could have prepared itself better. Anoop Nautiyal, founder of the Dehradun-based think tank Social Development for Communities Foundation, said when the first fire was reported in October 2020, the government should have known what was on the cards. \u201cIt is only April. What will happen in May and June when the temperatures soar further?\u201d\n\nAfter Union Home Minister Amit Shah\u2019s intervention, two helicopters have been pressed into service and a team of NDRF has been stationed in Haldwani.\n\nMr. Bhartari said the fire had been contained on the ground and it has not risen to crown level in any of the districts. \u201cThere has been rain in Pithoragarh today [Tuesday] and in the coming two days, there is a forecast of light to medium precipitation in different parts of the State. We hope the situation would soon come under control,\u201d he said.\n\nAmong other methods, Mr. Bhartari said they also lit up controlled fire in a forest strip to remove fuel from the path of the rampaging fire storm. \u201cSometimes, fire also helps in extinguishing fire.\u201d\n\nHowever, concerns have been raised on how the valuation of the loss from forest fire is done. According to the government bulletin, the loss in April is \u20b914,18,909 from 645.3 hectares. Mr. Nautiyal said it roughly comes about \u20b92,500 per hectare. \u201cThis is nothing when we consider the rich biodiversity a hectare or 15 bighas of forest land contains.\u201d\n\nHe cited a report of a study commissioned by the Uttarakhand government in 2018. Conducted by the Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal, the report evaluated the cost of ecoservices rendered by the State. \u201cIt said the monetary value of flow benefits from the Uttarakhand forests is approximately \u20b995,112 rores annually. It is equivalent to an annual flow value of \u20b93,88,085 per hectare of forest in Uttarakhand.\u201d\n\nMr. Bhartari admitted that the parameters for valuation of loss from forest fire needed some amendments. \u201cWe will look into it but right now our focus is on dousing the fire,\u201d he said.", "cat": "Other States"},

The robust volumes led to a 92 per cent YoY growth in electricity market during the month, it added.\n\nThe market faced transmission congestion on the inter-state transmission network due to which 24MU was lost during the month, representing 0.03 per cent of total traded volume.\n\nCumulatively for the fiscal year 2021, the IEX market performed spectacularly well despite the CoVID-19 induced lock-down which resulted in the significant reduction in the demand for electricity in the country in the first two quarters of the year.\n\nThe electricity market achieved all-time high volume of 73,941 MU during the year leading to 37.2 per cent YoY growth.\n\nThe new market segments introduced during fiscal year 2021 \u2013 the real time market (RTM) as well as the green market, made 14 per cent contribution to the volume traded during the year.\n\nAs per the NLDC (national load dispatch centre) data for fiscal year 2021, national peak demand for electricity at 190 GW saw 3.5 per cent growth while electricity consumption at 1,281 BU (billion units) was down 0.6 per cent YoY.\n\nThe term-ahead market (TAM) comprising intra-day, contingency, daily & weekly contracts traded 234 MU during the month of March. Cumulatively, for the fiscal year 2021, the TAM traded a total of 3,272 MU.\n\nThe real-time market (RTM) continued its splendid performance during March\u201921 and crossed 1BU benchmark for the fourth consecutive month.\n\nThe RTM saw the highest ever monthly volume of 1,414 MU with 26 per cent MoM growth. It also recorded the highest single-day volume of 63 MU on 23 March, 2021. With sell-side bids at 1.8X of cleared volume, the market continued to have ample availability of power.\n\nThe market has emerged as the preferred option for the distribution utilities and industrial consumers to address real-time electricity demand supply balance in the most competitive and efficient manner with the delivery of power at just 1-hour notice, it added.\n\nThis is also evident from the fact that the market saw participation from over 400 market participants during the month. The real-time market has cumulatively traded 9,468 MU since its commencement on 1st June, 2020.\n\nThe Green Term Ahead Market (GRAM) traded a volume of 51 MU during the month of March comprising 21 MU in the solar segment and 30 MU in the non-solar segment.\n\nA total of 24 participants participated during the month with distribution utilities from Haryana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, New Delhi, Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra among others as the key participants.\n\nThe GTAM has been enabling distribution utilities, industrial consumers, and green generators to buy and sell green power while also supporting them in fulfilling their Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO) targets in the most competitive way. The market has cumulatively traded 786 MU volume since its launch on 21 August, 2020.\n\nThe REC (renewable energy certificate) trading session which was scheduled on 31 March\u201921 did not take place due to the stay order from the APTEL (Appellate Tribunal For Electricity) in response to the petitions filed by a few Renewable Energy Associations against the CERC (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission) order issued in June, 2020 regarding revision in the floor and forbearance prices of REC.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the REC market cumulatively traded a 6.97 lakh certificates.", "cat": "Industry"},

I had earlier told the government that they ought to check whether these people entering Maharashtra had tested negative or had even done RT-PCR tests. But the government paid no heed to my suggestions and did not restrict inter-State travel,\u201d said the MNS chief, remarking that owing to this situation, the people of Maharashtra were compelled to be locked inside their homes.\n\nAppalling shortage of beds\n\nMr. Thackeray, who is Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray\u2019s cousin, ticked-off the administration also on the appalling shortage of beds across hospitals.\n\n\u201cDespite the Mumbai civic body giving so many facilities to major hospitals, beds are not available for ordinary patients. Commoners are forced to run from pillar to post to get a bed which is usually made available only through the intervention of local politicians,\u201d he said.\n\nThe MNS chief warned that if the government did not compel Mumbai\u2019s top hospitals to put up correct information regarding the availability of beds, the MNS would do so using their trademark means.\n\nHe said that during his web meeting with the Chief Minister, he had urged a loosening of the harsh restrictions, notably the weekend lockdown, imposed across the State which severely affected small traders, students and salon and gym owners and staff among others.\n\n\u201cWhile those who have small industries have been asked to produce, sales are prohibited as all non-essential shops are decreed shut. What is the point of production? Therefore, I requested the Chief Minister to allow non-essential retail shops and small traders to function for at least two-three days a week. Further, the government must waive electricity bills during the lockdown, exempt traders from GST and allow gyms and salons to function for at least some time during the week.\u201d\n\nHe asked why school fee remained the same despite educational establishments being shut and urged that Class 10 and 12 students be promoted without exams.\n\nTraders\u2019 associations take out in protests\n\nSeveral traders\u2019 associations in Pune, Nagpur and Mumbai came out in protest against the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government\u2019s weekend lockdown and stringent curfew rules.\n\nFormer Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, BJP\u2019s Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, urged the Chief Minister to hold discussions with traders\u2019 bodies and reconsider the curbs imposed which were hitting the smaller elements of the economy very hard.\n\nIn a letter to the Chief Minister, Mr. Fadnavis said: \u201cI had recently received a call from you regarding the increase in the cases and the need for strict restrictions. While we had agreed on the two-day lockdown, the manner in which the other five days of lockdown-like restrictions have been imposed has caused great uneasiness in the minds of people, who have taken to the streets to protest in some places.\u201d\n\nTerming that the restrictions that have actually been imposed were, in a way, an \u201cunannounced month-long lockdown\u201d, Mr. Fadnavis said the situation of retailers, small shopkeepers, small hotel owners, salons and gym owners must be taken into account.", "cat": "Other States"},

Singh Deo hit back saying that the supply of vaccines have been erratic with supplies nearly running out on Monday.\n\nMr. Deo said with the spiralling cases, a partial lockdown in the affected districts cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe State on Monday reported the highest number of 7,302 COVID-19 cases in a day and 44 fatalities. Chhattisgarh\u2019s Durg district is the latest entrant in the top ten districts with maximum active cases. The Union Health Ministry has said the number of deaths in the State is also worrying.\n\nMr. Deo said the State has 30,381 public sites where vaccinations are being administered for free along with private facilities for those who can pay.\n\n\u201cWe have a capacity to administer four lakh vaccines in a day. But the supply has been erratic, which is a problem. We can not mobilise people and then turn them away just because we do not have the vaccines,\u201d he told The Hindu. The State had nearly run out of stocks on Monday and doses were belatedly rushed. \u201cThe supply chain has to remain unbroken,\u201d he added.\n\nMr Deo said the State unfortunately is in a worrisome situation and the immunity with the vaccine will also kick in only in 70 days for the population that is going through its first dose now. The government hospitals in the state are running out of the ICU beds, he said, adding to the already precarious situation. The State will hold a meeting on the situation on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lockdown will certainly slow down things. But the decision is with the Chief Minister (Bhupesh Baghel). But my suggestion is to not impose a lockdown based on a subjective decision. We should have certain criteria like the positivity rate and availability of hospital beds to take that recourse,\u201d Mr Singh said. He added that a positivity rate of 25% is worrisome and 30% is a red alert.", "cat": "Other States"},

The growth outlook for India however comes with significant downside risks because of the current pandemic wave the country is experiencing, IMF economists said.\n\nThe projections for India were based on evidence to support the normalization of economic activity but these forecasts preceded the current wave of COVID-19 in India, \u201c which is quite concerning,\u201d IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nThe current growth projections already take \u201c a fairly conservative view\u201d IMF economist Malhar Nabar said.\n\n\u201c But it\u2019s true that with this very worrying uptick in cases\u2026poses very severe downside risks tothe growth outlook for the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter an estimated contraction of 3.3% in 2020 (calendar year), the global economy is expected to grow 6% this year and 4.4% next year, although there are significant divergences within and between countries. Projections for 2021 are slightly higher than they were in October 2020 due to fiscal support in some large economies and vaccine-supported recovery. The U.S.\u2019s 1.3 percentage point forecast upgrade, especially, contributed to this, resulting in U.S. growth projections of 6.4% and 3.5% this calendar year and next.\n\nThe U.S. GDP level in 2022 is forecast to be higher than in a non-pandemic scenario \u2013 the only large economy for which this is true. Other economies are also expected to rebound this year albeit at a slower rate, as per the IMF. The Euro Area is projected to grow at 4.4% and 3.8% over these time periods; China, at 8.4% and 5.6%.\n\nGlobal growth is projected to settle at 3.3% in the medium term due to damage inflicted on supply potential as well factors that pre-date the pandemic such as ageing (which has resulted in slower labour force growth in advanced economics and some emerging markets).\n\n\u201cRecoveries are also diverging dangerously across and within countries, as economies with slower vaccine rollout, more limited policy support, and more reliant on tourism do less well,\u201d Ms Gopinath said.\n\nAverting divergent outcomes would mean \u201cresolving the health crisis everywhere\u201d the report says. The average annual loss in per capita GDP over the 2020-24 period relative to pre-pandemic forecasts is expected to be 5.7% in low-income countries and 4.7% in emerging markets, For advanced economies, this number is a lower: 2.3%.\n\nPandemic pushed another 95 million into extreme poverty in 2020\n\n\u201cSuch losses are reversing gains in poverty reduction, with an additional 95 million people expected to have entered the ranks of the extreme poor in 2020 compared with pre-pandemic projections,\u201d Ms Gopinath said.\n\nPointing to uneven recovery within countries, Ms Gopinath wrote, the unskilled, young and women were more impacted.\n\n\u201cWomen have also suffered more, especially in emerging market and developing economies. Because the crisis has accelerated the transformative forces of digitalization and automation, many of the jobs lost are unlikely to return, requiring worker reallocation across sectors\u2014which often comes with severe earnings penalties,\u201d Ms Gopinath wrote in a blogpost accompanying the report.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is expected to \u2018leave smaller scars\u2019 than the 2008 financial crisis, due to the unprecedented policy response. However, emerging markets and low-income countries are expected to suffer more medium -term than their high income counterparts according to the IMF.\n\nGiven the large uncertainty surrounding the outlook, the report recommended that policymakers \u201cprioritize policies that would be prudent, regardless of the state of the world that prevails\u2014for instance, strengthening social protection with wider eligibility for unemployment insurance to cover the self-employed and informally employed.\u201d It also advocated adequate resources for healthcare, education, vocational training, early childhood development programs and investing in green infrastructure.\n\nThe report called for international cooperation, specifically to ensure adequate vaccine access globally, including by sufficiently funding COVAX, the international vaccine facility.\n\n\u201cThe international community also needs to work together to ensure that financially constrained economies have adequate access to international liquidity so that they can continue needed health care, other social, and infrastructure spending required for development and convergence to higher levels of income per capita,\u201d the IMF report said.", "cat": "Economy"},

The court has left it to the discretion of the CBI Director to steer the future course of action after the completion of the initial investigation.\n\nThe Maharashtra government\u2019s petition in the Supreme Court has made Mr. Singh the sole respondent while Mr. Deshmukh has arraigned the Maharashtra government, the CBI, the Ministry of Home Affairs and Mr. Singh as respondents.\n\nThe High Court had justified a CBI investigation as Mr. Deshmukh was Home Minister in charge of the State Police. It had said an investigation by an independent agency like the CBI would instil public confidence.\n\nThe HC had reasoned that a \u201cfair, impartial, unbiased and untainted\u201d investigation would not be possible with Mr. Deshmukh at the helm. However, Mr. Deshmukh quit office closely after the HC order.\n\nWith the filing of the petitions, the controversy concerning Mr. Singh's allegations have, in a way, returned to the Supreme Court.\n\nOn March 24, the apex court had refused to intervene in a petition filed by the former Mumbai Police Commissioner for a CBI investigation into his allegations of corruption and abuse of office levelled against Mr. Deshmukh after his unceremonious transfer to the Home Guards.\n\nInstead, a Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and R. Subhash Reddy had asked Mr. Singh, who was represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, to approach the Bombay High Court with his plea for an investigation by an independent agency.\n\nIn his earlier petition, Mr. Singh had mentioned that his complaints about Mr. Deshmukh were ignored by Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and other senior leaders.\n\nMr. Singh had alleged that Mr. Deshmukh held meetings with \u201cofficers of lower rank\u201d like Sachin Vaze, now in custody in connection with the Mukesh Ambani residence bomb scare case, and Sanjay Patil, an ACP with the Social Service Branch, at his residence in February. This was done \u201cbypassing their seniors\u201d. The Home Minister had \u201cinstructed\u201d the duo to \u201caccumulate \u20b9100 crore every month\u201d, Mr. Singh has alleged.\n\nThe former top cop had alleged that the Minister, besides using police officers for his \u201cmalicious intent of extorting money\u201d, interfered with investigations, ordering them to be conducted in a \u201cparticular manner\u201d. He had also indulged in corrupt practices in official postings and transfers of officers.", "cat": "Other States"},

He also noted that many believe Mr. Netanyahu is unfit to serve in light of his legal problems.\n\nNonetheless, he said that there was nothing in the law preventing Mr. Netanyahu from serving as prime minister and that after consulting with the 13 parties in the newly elected parliament, he believed that Mr. Netanyahu had the best chance of any candidate of forming a new government.\n\n\u201cNo candidate has a realistic chance of forming a government that will have the confidence of the Knesset,\u201d Rivlin said. But, he said, Mr. Netanyahu has a \u201cslightly higher chance\u201d of being able to.\n\n\u201cI have decided to entrust him with the task,\u201d Rivlin said from Jerusalem.

Though Mr. Netanyahu currently lacks a majority of support and is on trial, Rivlin nonetheless said he has the best chance of being able to cobble together a governing coalition.\n\nMr. Netanyahu now has up to six weeks to complete the task and avoid sending Israel to an unprecedented fifth consecutive election.\n\nRivlin issued the mandate with something short of full-throated support, pointing out that moral questions hovered over the decision.\n\nMr. Netanyahu holds the most support - 52 seats - in Israel\u2019s splintered Knesset. But that is still short of a 61-seat majority. He is likely to use his powers of persuasion to try to lure a number of opponents, including a number of former close aides who have vowed never to serve under him again, with generous offers of powerful government ministries or legislative committees.\n\nRivlin\u2019s decision merges questions of Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s legal and political future in what\u2019s perhaps the starkest political challenge of his career.\n\nIn court, he faces fraud, breach of trust and bribery charges in three separate cases.

The Bone Season is set in 2059 in a world where clairvoyants hide their powers from the oppressive rule of Scion.\n\nPaige is a dreamwalker, a powerful clairvoyant, and works in the London criminal underworld. When she is drugged, kidnapped and imprisoned in Oxford, she realises there is a shadow government run by otherworldly beings, the Rephaim, who control Scion. Her jailor is an inscrutable Rephaite, Arcturus. The books following The Bone Season \u2014 The Mime Order (2015) and The Song Rising (2017) \u2014 follow Paige as she escapes from Oxford and starts a revolution. The recently released The Mask Falling (Bloomsbury), picks up the action in Paris.\n\nEmotional heart\n\nSamantha describes The Mask Falling as the heart of the series. \u201cIt is the middle point \u2013 the fourth book out of seven \u2013 but it also brings together everything I loved most about the first three books and sets up a few key mysteries for the last three. It is where some important threads are tied up while others continue into the second arc of the series. I also see it as the emotional heart, where I explore the relationship between Arcturus and Paige, arguably the backbone of the series, in more depth than ever before.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old author says the series is a marriage of her two favourite genres \u2014 dystopian fiction and epic fantasy. \u201cI call it an epic dystopia. Reading books like The Hunger Games or The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, I was always curious to know what was going on beyond that setting. In the Bone Season books, you can see the dystopia from multiple perspectives.\u201d\n\nHeart of darkness\n\nJack the Ripper is an important marker in the series. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in the phenomenon of \u2018Rippermania\u2019 for a long time. I was taken on a walking tour in Whitechapel when I was quite young (probably too young) and the mystery has haunted me ever since. The alternate history of The Bone Season series begins in 1859, so I knew the timeline was going to cover the Ripper\u2019s reign of terror. I look for places to connect the real and the unreal, to ground the fantastical elements, and that seemed like a good one.\u201d\n\nConnecting the real and unreal calls for intensive research, which London-based Samantha says was fun. \u201cExploring Paris, which is my favourite city, is always a pleasure. I got to eat plenty of croissants. The linguistic aspect of The Mask Falling was a challenge, as I don\u2019t speak French. I had to rely on friends to translate the dialogue for me, and it took me a while to work out how to deal with the sexism built into the language, since Scion isn\u2019t a patriarchy.\u201d\n\nThe old Vic\n\nLanguage brings us to the slang of the clairvoyants, which is an adaptation of the speech of the London criminal underworld from the 18th and 19th centuries. Samantha says she did that because it is supposed to indicate that Scion is still being affected by an event that occurred during that period. \u201cA lot of 18th and 19th-century slang is such a treasure trove. I often look at the past for interesting, archaic words and phrases to weave into my work.\u201d\n\nThe pros of writing a series, according to the author, is spending time in one world with one cast of characters, allowing you to develop and layer them over several years. \u201cThat is such a joy and privilege. Paige and I have been able to grow up together. The main drawback is scheduling. You ideally want to get the books out as quickly as possible so readers can continue the story without having to wait for years, but that can be a challenge for slower writers.\u201d\n\nLove, not war\n\nWhile there are thrilling battles galore in the series, Samantha prefers writing love scenes. \u201cThey are a joy, especially when the two characters have a complex relationship. People are always surprised when I admit I can\u2019t stand writing action\u2013 I find it tedious.\u201d\n\nEngaging with readers on social media Samantha says is a boon and bane. \u201cIt has been a great comfort throughout the pandemic. It has kept me connected to the publishing industry while there haven\u2019t been any in-person events, and I love being able to hear from readers from all over the world.\u201d Samantha says, social media can, however, be distracting and panic-inducing if you scroll for too long. \u201cI would like to step back from it while I work on my next draft, but it is tough.\u201d\n\nThe four-year gap between The Song Rising and The Mask Falling, Samantha says because her editor had The Song Rising for a long time and she wrote the standalone fantasy, The Priory of the Orange Tree between the two instalments. \u201cIt ended up taking me far longer than I expected to edit, which affected The Mask Falling. I also had a bereavement in late 2019, my beloved grandmother passed away, which meant I missed a couple of important deadlines.\u201d\n\nListening in\n\nSamantha says she hasn\u2019t listened to many audiobooks. \u201cI find my concentration slips and I keep having to re-listen to sections. I am glad they exist, and I would like to get into them. I have listened to all Bone Season audiobooks and really enjoy Alana Kerr Collins\u2019 narration. She captures Paige\u2019s emotions very well.\u201d\n\nApart from the four novels in the series, there are also a couple of novellas set in the same universe. \u201cThe Pale Dreamer is a standalone prequel to the Bone Season series \u2013 the story of how Paige first earned her name in the criminal underworld of London. It will give readers a taste of the series and introduce them to some of its key characters. The Dawn Chorus is an in-depth exploration of Paige\u2019s trauma after a certain event in The Song Rising.\u201d\n\nA film based on The Bone Season was in initial development at 20th Century Fox. \u201cI have now realised it would be far stronger as a TV show. I\u2019m working with a British production company to bring that to fruition.\u201d\n\nFuture plans include another novel. \u201cAs soon as that is done, I will jump into the fifth Bone Season book.\u201d", "cat": "Life & Style"},

It shows that the Muslim vote bank is slipping out of her hands. Had we said the same thing that all Hindus should unite, everybody would have criticised us. The EC would have sent us notices. We would have been censured,\u201d Mr. Modi said while addressing an election rally here.\n\nThe BJP on April 5 approached the Election Commission of India (ECI) seeking action against Ms. Banerjee, alleging she violated the Representation of the People\u2019s Act by asking Muslims to come together and vote for her party TMC in the state assembly polls.\n\nTaking a dig at Ms. Banerjee\u2019s comment, rhetorically questioning whether BJP leaders predicting the party\u2019s victory were Gods or superhumans, Mr. Modi said no one needs to be superhuman to predict BJP\u2019s victory as the wave in favour of the saffron camp spoke for itself.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to trouble God to find out who is losing and who is winning. Janata Janardhana [public], in the form of God, has given their response, it is known which way the wind is blowing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDidi\u2019s exit is imminent.

His journey from a junior artiste (Mazhavilkoodaaram, 1995) to one of the bankable stars in the industry has been nothing short of a dream run. Having emerged as a versatile actor, Joju is elated that he has some interesting films lined up for release. Ready to hit screens on April 8 is Nayattu, directed by Martin Prakkat.\n\nAlso Read | Get \u2018First Day First Show\u2019, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here\n\nJoju will be seen in yet another police role in Nayattu. \u201cI might have played over 40 police characters till date. But this is a cut above the rest. He is a hefty character, literally and figuratively. I was at my heaviest, 132 kilogram, when I did the role!\u201d laughs Joju, adding that he is now trying to get back to shape.\n\nJoju George, Kunchacko Boban and Nimisha Sajayan in a still from \u2018Nayattu\u2019 | Photo Credit: Anup Chacko\n\nWithout revealing much about the plot, Joju says that Nayattu is a \u201csurvival movie\u201d, revolving around three police personnel, SI Maniyan (Joju), Praveen Michael (Kunchacko Boban) and Sunitha (Nimisha Sajayan) who are on the run. \u201cThe film also looks at the lives of policemen, up close and personal, an aspect that has been rarely explored in our cinema,\u201d he adds.\n\nNayattu is scripted by real-life cop, Shahi Kabir, who wrote the thriller, Joseph, which took Joju\u2019s career to new heights. He towered as the titular character, a retired police officer, who goes all out to unearth a crime. \u201cI was the first one to hear the story of Nayattu, when we were working on Joseph. I love Shahi\u2019s stories as I can easily connect with the emotions that he puts across. His characters are real and rooted\u2026 and their journey is phenomenal,\u201d says Joju.\n\nThe actor points out that Nayattu will be a project that Malayalam cinema will be proud about. \u201cA lot of effort has gone into the script, designing the plot, shooting location, choosing the cast\u2026There are many new faces who have given vibrant performances. Camera, editing, soundscape, music\u2026every department shines through,\u201d he says. This is his first work with Martin as an actor, although they have jointly produced films such as Charlie and Udaharanam Sujatha. \u201cWhen I asked him for a role in his directorial debut, ABCD, he said I was not ready! (laughs) I don\u2019t know whether I was in his mind when he heard the story of Nayattu. Since the film has been shot in sync sound, I haven\u2019t seen the film as a whole. But I am sure this will be a prestigious project in Martin\u2019s career; you can see his growth as a director,\u201d he adds.\n\nJoju George and Nimisha Sajayan in a still from \u2018Nayattu\u2019 | Photo Credit: Special arrangement\n\nJoju admits that he still has not come to terms with the fact that he is getting to share the screen with big names in Malayalam cinema. \u201cI\u2019m excited when I meet them. I often wonder if it was difficult for them to accommodate an artiste like me who came into cinema playing blink-and-you-miss kind of roles,\u201d he says.\n\nHe makes note of his recent release One, a political thriller, in which he plays Babychan, secretary of the ruling party and a classmate and close friend of Chief Minister Kadakkal Chandran, played by Mammootty. \u201cWhen I used to go from one film location to another looking for roles or as a junior artiste, I would watch Mammookka [Mammootty], Lalettan [Mohanlal] and other actors from a distance. I wouldn\u2019t dare to go near them. My friends used to come with me then. Many years later, after watching One, one of those friends told me that he had goosebumps when he heard me address Mammookka as \u2018eda\u2019 (Hey you) in a scene. Chackochan [Kunchacko Boban] was already a star when I met him the first time; he has always supported me.\u201d\n\nJoju\u2019s upcoming releases are Malik, Thuramukham, Pada, Star and Oru Thathwika Avalokanam. \u201cBesides intense characters, there are a couple of feel-good roles as well. There is Madhuram an out-an-out romantic tale directed by Ahammed Khabeer, director of June. It shows how love blooms in the lives of people of different age groups. In Peace, I play this carefree dad, who can\u2019t wait to get married again!\u201d\n\nJoju George and Kunchacko Boban in a still from \u2018Nayattu\u2019 | Photo Credit: Anup Chacko\n\nJoju is thrilled about his Tamil d\u00e9but in Dhanush-starrer Jagame Thanthiram, directed by Karthik Subbaraj and scheduled for an OTT release. \u201cIt is a larger-than-life character. The film happened because of Joseph and Chola (Alli in Tamil),\u201d says Joju. He is also part of Buffoon, also from Karthik\u2019s production house.\n\nMeanwhile, he keeps mum about his entry into Telugu industry. \u201cLet it be a surprise. It is a big budget project,\u201d he chuckles.\n\nHe is a two-time winner of Kerala State film awards \u2014 in 2015 he won special jury mention for Oru Second Class Yathra and Lukka Chuppi and in 2018 for best character actor for Chola and Joseph. \u201cIt feels good that now I can be choosy about my roles instead of doing every film that comes my way. I want to keep improving myself. I feel I ought to concentrate more and look further into nuances of the characters,\u201d he says.\n\nBefore signing off, Joju has advice for aspiring actors. \u201cI get messages saying they have been struggling for two or three years. It took years for me to get my first dialogue and nearly two decades to get a break. It is important that you learn from the struggles, rejections and each film. If you have the right kind of approach and work hard, this is the best industry to work, for both men and women. There are enough opportunities out there\u2026\u201d", "cat": "Movies"},

It could well settle some of the questions/issues that have come to define recent politics in the State.\n\nThe BJP may be seeking a second term for its first government in the northeastern State but the party went to the polls without announcing the incumbent Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal as its face for a second term. It\u2019s an acknowledgement of the importance of Himanta Biswa Sarma or HBS \u2014 the Minister who holds a number of portfolios, including Finance and Health, and is the face of the party in the northeast though he is number two in Assam. It is also a sign of a possible post-poll scenario if the BJP were to win.\n\nMr. Sarma, who joined the BJP in August 2015 from the Congress, occupied the same position under the late Tarun Gogoi in the Congress government. There was a time when his proximity to Mr. Gogoi created not only a wedge between the then Chief Minister and party veterans but also drove many of the old-timers out.\n\nKnown to be an efficient Minister and a hard taskmaster, Mr. Sarma has been harbouring an ambition for the top post since 2014, when the Congress, after faring poorly in the Lok Sabha poll, had toyed with the idea of replacing the Chief Minister and bringing in young blood.\n\nAs a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Gogoi, HBS, who was 45 years old then, fit the description. He was also counting on senior Congressmen to deliver on their \u201cpromise\u201d of promoting him to the top post. But he is said to have hit a wall in Rahul Gandhi and the emergence of Gaurav Gogoi as an articulate Member of Parliament created more stumbling blocks.\n\nNow, seven years later and after having proven his utility in the rival party, the current election could define Mr. Sarma\u2019s future path.\n\nOn the other side of the divide, the Congress is struggling to fill the large shoes of Mr. Gogoi despite Assam being one of the few States where the Congress has an organisational presence in every block and every district.\n\nThe Congress, too, went with the collective leadership of State chief Ripun Bora, Lok Sabha member Debabrata Saikia, Lok Sabha MP Pradyut Bordoloi and Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, apart from Gogoi junior.\n\nThe result of the poll would surely have an impact on who leads the party in the State.\n\nNRC, CAA\n\nThe outcome of the poll could determine the direction of the debate around the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). While there is a view elsewhere that both the CAA and the Supreme Court-mandated exercise of updating the NRC are exclusionary processes, in Assam there is considerable support for the NRC and opposition to the CAA.\n\nThat explains why the Congress claims credit for piloting the NRC project while staunchly opposing the CAA since it discriminates on the basis of religion.\n\nEven the All India United Democratic Front and its leader Badruddin Ajmal \u201cwelcomed\u201d the NRC. Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Ajmal had argued that the NRC would finally put an end to the \u201cforeigner\u201d tag that many Bengali-speaking settlers have to endure in their day-to-day lives.\n\nThe issue of illegal immigrants \u2014 identified as undocumented migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh who came into the State after March 24, 1971 \u2014 has defined the State\u2019s politics for over 40 years now.\n\nWhile the original students\u2019 agitation (1979-1985) led by All Assam Students\u2019 Union (AASU) was largely bereft of religious identity and focussed more on cultural and linguistic differences, the movement translated into a more communally sharp politics.\n\nIf the Congress and the AIUDF have been charged with \u201cprotecting the migrants\u201d, the BJP has taken the debate to a different tangent by comparing the election to a fight between indigenous communities and invaders like the Mughals!\n\nMany intellectuals in Assam, however, argue that it is not one\u2019s faith but the fear of being \u201coutnumbered\u201d that drives the anti-CAA sentiments.\n\nRegional parties\n\nIt\u2019s this anger and fear against the CAA that gave rise to two new regional parties in the State: the Axom Jatiya Parishad and the Raijor Dal. This phenomenon is not new to the State where Assamese sub-nationalism defined the agitation of the late 70s and early 1980s. But for the past two decades, it has mostly been bipolar, with the BJP overshadowing earlier regional players like the Asom Gana Parishad.\n\nThe election could well decide the possibility of an alternative to the existing players in Assam\u2019s politics.", "cat": "Assam"},

We were talking about a 28% tax that everybody thought was just fair enough for everybody,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe idea \u2026 here you have 51 or 52 corporations of the Fortune 500 haven\u2019t paid a single penny in taxes for three years. Come on, man. Let\u2019s get real,\u201d Mr. Biden said in response to a question.\n\nMr. Biden said that he is going to push as hard as he can to change the circumstances so the U.S. can compete with the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cEverybody around the world is investing billions and billions of dollars in infrastructure, and we\u2019re going to do it here,\u201d he added.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Chicago Council on Global Affairs that it\u2019s important to work with other countries to end the pressures of tax competition and corporate tax-based erosion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom. Together, we can use a global minimum tax to make sure that the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Ms. Yellen, one of the consequence of an interconnected world has been a 30-year race to the bottom on corporate tax rates.\n\n\u201cCompetitiveness is about more than how U.S. headquarters--headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids. It\u2019s about making sure the governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government,\u201d she said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the corporate tax rate being proposed is lower than it was in 2017.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s lower than it was from World War Two until 2017. So we are still proposing a rate that is lower than it has been for the vast majority of time,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her address to the Chicago Council, Ms. Yellen said a personal objective of her is to focus on America; international engagements on fostering full legal rights and greater economic and education opportunities for women and girls, given the clear evidence that this will support inclusive economic growth more broadly.\n\n\u201cSpeaking from my own experience, we need to do better at reducing barriers for women\u2019s economic empowerment, even unconscious ones, in nearly every country in the world, including the United States,\u201d she said.\n\nThe most evident immediate example is the need to address global health risks. COVID-19 has clearly shown that pandemic responses require global cooperation. \u201cWe\u2019re working with our partners to enhance pandemic preparedness against future shots. We need to learn lessons from this pandemic to be better prepared to stop future contagious diseases before they become full-scale pandemics,\u201d she said.", "cat": "International"},

A source familiar with Saturday\u2019s conversation between the ministers said the talks were \u201cpositive\u201d.\n\nThe Indian companies did not respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment. Saudi Aramco declined to comment.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, agreed on Thursday to a gradualeasing of their oil output cuts from May after the new U.S. administration called on Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the producer group, to keep energy affordable for consumers.\n\nOn Sunday Saudi Aramco, the kingdom\u2019s state oil company, raised the official selling price, or OSP, of its oil for Asia while cutting it for Europe and American markets.\n\n\u201cWe were surprised when they announced cuts for other markets while raising OSPs for Asia,\u201d said one of the sources.\n\nIndia suggested that refiners look for energy alternatives to Gulf oil, its main source of crude.\n\nTensions between the two countries escalated further after Abdulaziz last month advised India to use the stocks of crude it bought cheaply during the price slump in 2020. Pradhan termed Abdulaziz\u2019s response as \u201cundiplomatic\u201d.\n\nTo dial down the disagreement, Abdulaziz last week said that Aramco maintained normal April oil supplies to Indian refiners while cutting volumes for other buyers and conceded that voluntary output curbs have put \u201cAramco in some difficulty with some of its partners\u201d.\n\nHe also said that Saudi Arabia will phase out its additional voluntary cut in stages by July.\n\nIndian State refiners, meanwhile, have begun diversification of purchases to include Brazil\u2019s Tupi grade, Guyana\u2019s Liza oiland Norway\u2019s Johan Sevredrup in their crude diet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always believed that crude supply should be market determined rather than artificially managed,\u201d Arindam Bagchi, spokesman for the foreign affairs ministry, said on Friday.\n\nHe said that even though OPEC+ has announced a slight easing of oil output cuts, they are still far below India\u2019sexpectations.", "cat": "National"},

After all, the comedy-drama film had not been very busy on the awards circuit; so the second the film\u2019s single \u2018Husavik - My Home Town\u2019 was mentioned, G\u00f6ransson leapt up and let his co-songwriters Savan Kotecha and Fat Max Gsus know.\n\nAlso Read | Get \u2018First Day First Show\u2019, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here\n\nKotecha, whose songwriting credits have featured in chart-toppers such as The Weeknd\u2019s \u2018Can\u2019t Feel My Face\u2019, and Ellie Goulding\u2019s \u2018Love Me Like You Do\u2019, was in his studio in Stockholm, Sweden, when he was notified of the nomination.\n\n\u201cI was just in shock,\u201d laughs the Indian-origin (Gujarati) musician who was the executive music producer of the 2020 film, \u201cSuddenly I had to go pick up my kids from school \u2014 just the strangest thing ever when you\u2019re just nominated for an Oscar. I have a very traditional Gujju family: my mom and dad know no pop culture references and were like \u2018that\u2019s good!\u2019 Meanwhile, one of the other parents at the school approached me, asking me if I was okay because there was shock on my face. I said, \u2018I\u2019ve just been nominated for an Oscar\u2019 and she right away asked me, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 and I replied, \u2018Brad Pitt.\u2019\u201d\n\nKotecha explains that \u201cone can never know how things truly go with these types of awards.\u201d Having co-written \u2018Love Me Like You Do\u2019 sung by Ellie Goulding for 50 Shades Of Grey (2015), he says, \u201cA lot of big people were confident \u2018LMLYD\u2019 would earn an Oscar nomination, given it was nominated for Golden Globes, Teen Choice Awards, Grammy Awards. But it surprised a lot of people when it wasn\u2019t. On the other hand, \u2018Husavik\u2019, which has been relatively quiet on the awards circuit, getting an Oscar nomination was a great surprise!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Gsus \u2014 whose credits include working with Taylor Swift on award-winning album 1989, P!nk, Tove Lo, and Zara Larsson \u2014 was in the studio when he heard of the nomination from Kotecha yelling in excitement over the phone. \u201cWhen Savan called me like that, I thought a fire had broken out. I didn\u2019t want to think too much about the nomination though. But it is safe to say that the session I was in at the time was ruined because I couldn\u2019t focus,\u201d he chuckles.\n\nThe three songwriters, who still cannot believe the Academy Award nomination is real, reminisce over a video call with MetroPlus about the making of \u2018Husavik\u2019 and its rippling effect in a time of loneliness.\n\nSigrit\u2019s journey\n\nNetflix film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga stars Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as members of an under-performing small-town Icelandic band Fire Saga, chosen by default to compete in the coveted Eurovision Song Contest on behalf of their country. The film also stars Dan Stevens, Pierce Brosnan, Demi Lovato and Mikael Persbrandt.\n\nThrough the film, many understood how much of a cult following the competition itself has. G\u00f6ransson says it was a huge part of his childhood.\n\nThat said, putting \u2018Husavik\u2019 together was no small feat, given the three songwriters almost played \u2018pass the parcel\u2019 as the song developed. The common mission was putting music to the journey of Sigrit (Rachel McAdams), instead of just creating a song about Eurovision. It was about getting into Sigrit\u2019s head and putting yourself on a mountain in Iceland, looking out and thinking about what life was like.\n\n\u2018Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\u2019 : Will Ferrell as Lars Erickssong, Rachel McAdams as Sigrit Ericksdottir | Photo Credit: Elizabeth Viggiano/NETFLIX\n\nThere were actually more than 60 versions of \u2018Husavik\u2019, including some with just guitar or piano. \u201cWe had the full song in Icelandic at one point, but no one would have understood it because we didn\u2019t even get that right,\u201d laughs Gsus.\n\nThe three, who have worked together on other projects over the years, agree there were \u201cno stupid ideas.\u201d G\u00f6ransson\u2019s jokes that one day, perhaps they will randomly release the Icelandic version but Gsus chimes in and says, \u201cmaybe for the Japanese DVD box collection!\u201d\n\nEarly on, the film\u2019s director David Dobkin and Kotecha knew this (\u2019Husavik\u2019) would be a key moment. Kotecha adds this was \u201cprobably the hardest one to crack, because it had to earn this comedic film an emotional ending. There wasn\u2019t the thought that this would carry the whole movie; it was important to just sum up the film and Sigrit\u2019s character arc.\u201d\n\n\u2018Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\u2019 : Will Ferrell as Lars Erickssong, Rachel McAdams as Sigrit Ericksdottir | Photo Credit: Netflix\n\n\u201cThe song shaped the script and the script shaped the song,\u201d explains G\u00f6ransson, who is also known as the drummer for band Carolina Liar, \u201cWe knew we had to write it as a pop song and treat Sigrit as a pop star, writing songs from her perspective. We packed a lot of the story into the song. It was fantastic to see Rachel as she made it very credible. And yes, though it\u2019s a Will Ferrell comedy, there\u2019s still this deep story you can relate to. Creating an emotion like that is a gift and a dream. And who doesn\u2019t want to create music with Will Ferrell?\u201d\n\nAn emotional chord\n\nWhen the movie was released, Kotecha received messages from musician Charlie Puth and Frankie Grande (Ariana Grande\u2019s brother). The whole team was also bombarded by many on social media, about how \u2018Husavik\u2019 was an emotional experience for them.\n\n\u201cFrankie sent a voice note of himself saying the song would be his summer anthem, and even told me we would get an Oscar nomination, to which I said \u2018that\u2019s sweet of him\u2019,\u201d muses Kotecha, \u201cAnd he was right. The film brought the world laughter at a time when people were scared and stressed out, figuring out this pandemic. The message of the song and characters was all about what really matters: being at home with the ones you love. We did not think this would even happen when we were making it, we just assumed it would be a fun bunch of pop songs.\u201d", "cat": "Movies"},

Jaishankar. Mr Lavrov said India and Russia are working for stability and connectivity in the Asia-Pacific and urged that \u201cmilitary alliances\u201d should not come up in Asia.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban movement is a part of Afghan society. Decision on the settlement in Afghanistan should foresee the participation of all political, ethnic and religious groups in the country. Otherwise the solution will not be stable. This decision has to be based on balance of ethnic, political and religious interests, including in the legislative bodies,\u201dMr Lavrov said.\n\n\u201cAny exclusion of any group from this process will not lead to an implementable and sustainable agreement which can lead to resumption of hostilities, which is not the desire of the stakeholders,\u201d he said in response to a question after both the ministers issued press statements.\n\nDr. Jaishankar said there is a need to \u201charmonise\u201d the interests of various stakeholders that are active in and around Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cFor India, what happens in Afghanistan impacts its security directly. I shared our approach that for a durable peace there would require harmonising the interest of all - both within and around that country. The peace process should be based on foundational principles to which we all subscribe and a political solution should mean independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan,\u201d said Mr. Jaishankar.\n\nU.S. initiative\n\nMr Lavrov referred to the interaction between the Taliban and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and urged for continued negotiation for peace.\n\n\u201cI will remind that the previous U.S. administration engaged the Taliban movement and created a window of opportunity to reach an agreement among all the hostile parties. As per the need to provide security in Afghanistan it depends on whether the settlement can take into account the political and security settlements,\u201d he said, emphasising that a sustainable solution to the Afghan war can be found under the \u2018Moscow format\u2019.\n\nApart from the Afghan situation, the major issue on the agenda for Tuesday's talks was expected to be the delivery of the Russian S400 missile defence system and the threat of U.S. sanctions that the delivery could attract. However, the ministers said the \u201cspecific\u201d issue did not come up during the discussion.\n\nHowever, Mr. Lavrov acknowledged that the U.S. exerts pressure on any country that wants to sign military and industrial contracts with Russia.\n\n\u201cWe did not discuss these response from the U.S. but we confirmed that we will deepen our military cooperation. We also discussed the prospects of manufacturing Russian military equipment under Make in India scheme,\u201d said Mr Lavrov. A diplomatic source however told The Hindu that \u201call issues\u201d were discussed between the two sides.\n\nSignificantly, the Indian membership in the Quad featured at the talks, according to Mr. Lavrov.\n\nAnswering a question, Mr. Lavrov indirectly took up the Quad and said he has heard of an \u2018Asian NATO\u2019 and \u2018Middle East NATO\u2019 and argued that Russia does not believe in the military alliance systems.\n\n\u201cToday we exchanged views on these. Our Indian friends have the same position.

It comes as a capsule that's taken daily.\n\nUnlike nearly all other ADHD medicines, Qelbree is not a stimulant or a controlled substance, making it harder to abuse than older drugs. That's been a problem with earlier ADHD treatments like Ritalin, nearly all of which contain the stimulants amphetamine or methylphenidate.\n\nQelbree, developed by Supernus Pharmaceuticals of Rockville, Maryland, carries a warning of potential for suicidal thoughts and behavior, which occurred in fewer than 1% of volunteers in studies of the drug.\n\nPrice not disclosed\n\nSupernus wouldn't disclose the drug's list price, but it's sure to be higher than the many cheap generic ADHD pills.\n\nADHD affects about 6 million American children and adolescents. For many, problems include trouble paying attention and completing tasks, fidgeting and impulsiveness.\n\nExperts say the drug may appeal to parents who don't want to give their child stimulants.\n\nIt also could be an option for kids who have substance abuse problems, dislike the side effects of stimulants or need additional therapy, said Dr. David W. Goodman, director of Suburban Psychiatric Associates near Baltimore and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\nGoodman said most ADHD patients taking medication currently are prescribed long-acting stimulants, which are harder to to abuse to get a high than the original, fast-acting versions.\n\nIn a key late-stage study funded by Supernus, 477 children ages 6 to 11 took the drug for six weeks. Inattention and hyperactivity symptoms were reduced by about 50% compared to the placebo group. Qelbree, also known as viloxazine, helped reduce symptoms in some study volunteers within a week. Common side effects include sleepiness, lethargy, decreased appetite and headache.\n\nSupernus is in late-stage testing for adults with ADHD. That's a much smaller group than children, but that market is growing because few adults currently take ADHD medicines.\n\nViloxazine was sold as an antidepressant in Europe for several decades, but was never approved by the FDA.

Click here to subscribe for free.)\n\nThe developers of Outriders, People Can Fly, make addictive action games in the simple shooter genre. Bulletstorm, for instance, was a first-person shooter with attacks that sent people flying, perhaps justifying the studio\u2019s unique name. Outriders is their wild attempt at the lucrative loot-shooter genre \u2014 which includes games such as Borderlands, Destiny and The Division.\n\nOutriders Developer: People Can Fly\n\nPeople Can Fly Publisher: Square Enix\n\nSquare Enix Price: \u20b93,499 on Nintendo Switch; \u20b93,999 on PC, Xbox Series and PlayStation PS4/PS5\n\nThe game has an extremely addictive shooter dynamics within a pretty good story. Humanity looks to planet Enoch after its mistakes destroy earth. You play as an Outrider, a highly trained soldier sent to scout and prepare the new planet for the rest of the colonists.\n\nBut a deadly energy storm kills your entire team and puts you in cryostasis. You wake up as an \u2018Altered\u2019, a mutated human with superpowers. And, you find yourself in the middle of another war. You face off against Enoch\u2019s monsters as well as factions of humans fighting over resources.\n\nScreenshot from \u2018Outriders\u2019 video game | Photo Credit: Square Enix\n\nOutriders has the plot of a blockbuster film. I wanted to go on several sidequests to explore the game\u2019s world and experience its action. The shaky camera on the cutscenes, however, is annoying. Thankfully, you can change the camera setting.\n\nThe game\u2019s action stands out. It borrows the best elements from several popular action games. Outriders is fast and frantic like Doom Eternal. And, you have the advantage of special powers. The game feels like Gears of War in both design and cover system, but there is also a distinct Mass Effect 3 vibe to it.\n\nScreenshot from \u2018Outriders\u2019 video game | Photo Credit: Square Enix\n\nFor your character, you can select from four distinct classes, each with its unique play-styles, strengths and weaknesses. The combination of gunplay and powers is great, but the cover system makes zero sense. The enemy AI is aggressive and is designed to keep you on your toes. They also cheat a bit. Hiding behind cover will automatically attract all their grenades, as they know where you are all the time. Additionally, the dodge button seems to have a mind of its own. On many occasions, I dodged the wrong way and one of the game\u2019s punishing Altered bosses made quick work of me.\n\nLet\u2019s go, co-op\n\nOutriders can be played solo by adjusting the difficulty tiers. But it is a game to be played with friends. In co-op, you can strategise and take down bosses effectively; encounters become a lot more fun. Though, at the time of writing this, there were many server down-times and game crashes on PC.\n\nScreenshot from \u2018Outriders\u2019 video game | Photo Credit: Square Enix\n\nThe game\u2019s core mechanics are strong with great animations but things feel a bit inconsistent. This is especially evident in the sound design. On some battles, it feels as if a bunch of kids put \u2018pew-pew\u2019 and \u2018tew-tew\u2019 fighting sounds in the game. Oddly, factors such as distance did not affect the sound. So, a gatling gun-wielding enemy, who is afar, sounds like he is right in front of me.\n\nWhile Outriders has a few rough edges, People Can Fly has done what EA, Bethesda and Crystal Dynamics struggled to do with Anthem, Fallout 76 and Avengers. It is a fun game with addictive gameplay mechanics and a decent story. Play it with your friends to make the most of it.\n\nThe writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novel", "cat": "Entertainment"},

This question often floors gadget gurus, as they scour online categories and often find options are lacking. As newer tech gets released, older models will naturally seem sub par.\n\n(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)\n\nThat said, Dell XPS 13 series \u2014 which certainly is not one of those merely affordable devices \u2014 is just reputed not just for its savvy design but also the ride-or-die life cycle. This model is made of CNC aluminium which sees the device carrying quite lightly, ideal for those sick of work-from-home and want to take the meetings and deadlines to a caf\u00e9 or a friend\u2019s place.\n\nOur review device was the Frost exterior that comes with an Arctic White glass fibre composite around the keyboard and trackpad, allowing for a comfortable grip and resting position for your palms.\n\nThe 13.4-inch display on the XPS 13 9310 is, as usual, eye-catching and not too high-contrast. Does it match up to the M1 MacBook\u2019s displays? It comes pretty close, thanks to the Intel Iris Xe\u2019s transformational GPU and integrated graphics that promise to support richer gaming experiences and greater speed for designers and creators.\n\nChipset: 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 Processor\n\n11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 Processor Video card: Intel Iris Xe Graphics\n\nIntel Iris Xe Graphics Display: 13.4\u201d FHD+ (1920 x 1200) InfinityEdge, non-touch anti-glare 500-nit display\n\n13.4\u201d FHD+ (1920 x 1200) InfinityEdge, non-touch anti-glare 500-nit display\n\n\n\nMemory: 512GB M.2 PCIe NVMe Solid State Drive\n\nDisplay size matters; the 500-nit (of brightness) screen\u2019s 16:10 aspect ratio makes for comfortable viewing thanks to there being more vertical space; when laptop screen ratios seem off-balance, this can affect how the user takes in information. In fact, this 91.5% screen-to-body ratio is known as \u2018a sweet spot\u2019 given it is ideal for both streaming and productivity. Goodbye, annoying black bars and weird bezels!\n\nOne of the most under-discussed aspects of a display is backlight bleed, when the display\u2019s light leaks around the edges of your screen, making it unevenly lit. This, too, can affect the viewing comfort and more laptop manufacturers are waking up to this as more users become more cognizant of this odd phenomena. Thankfully, the XPS 13 9310 does not have such noticeable backlight bleed, but you may catch a glimpse of it in low-light settings, so do not use this device in complete darkness.\n\nThe Dell XPS 13 9310 has a 3.5 mm headphone/microphone combo jack and Thunderbolt 4 on one side | Photo Credit: Divya Kala Bhavani\n\nThe touchscreen is a handy add-on, transforming the laptop into a wholly interactive device. But at the start of use, the touchscreen was not too responsive for me, so I merely adjusted my reliance on this feature. The Gorilla Glass 6 gives off a reflective and glossy finish which can be a trial to keep fingerprint-free if you are like me and are constantly distracted by every little smudge.\n\nThe battery of the XPS 13 9310 is impressive; I was able to get 16 hours of productivity out of a single full charge while gaming got a good 10 hours. My first uses ended up causing quite a bit of overheating to the point of discomfort but there are some energy distribution settings one can calibrate to amend this. Dell has purposefully invested more in performance and display here, making it one of the best Windows 10 ultrabooks out there.\n\nI have always appreciated Dell\u2019s keyboard designs; in the case of the XPS 13 9310, the chiclet keyboard is quite comfortable and has smooth key travel as well as intuitive feedback. All these factors make for better productivity The trackpad is responsive and has a decent precision to it too.\n\nAn HD issue?\n\nUnfortunately, Dell still has not listened to the mass cries of its consumer base around its grainy camera. There is only a slight improvement in the XPS 13 9310\u2019s built-in webcam. However, in several different video calls, my webcam-captured self looked like variants of a Van Gogh painting. Given the webcam is located within the frame itself, it is easy to get your fingerprint smudge on there; before your video calls, give it a good wipe with a microfibre cloth.\n\nThe Dell XPS 13 9310 has a sturdy hinge | Photo Credit: Divya Kala Bhavani\n\nSome users may have to dish out extra cash for a HD webcam as well as a small ring light to keep themselves video call-ready.\n\nSetting buyers back by \u20b91,50,990, the device better come with some decent support. Dell India has prompt servicing and you can look forward to pan-country help, wherever the glitches may happen. The Dell XPS 13 9310 is a great ultrabook but there are some great high-performance options in the market costing under one lakh, such as from Asus, Dell, HP and Apple.\n\nIf you are to opt for this Dell XPS 13 9310, do it with your all and be ready for all that comes your way, because this is one that will occupy your workspace for at least the next two to three years.", "cat": "Gadgets"},

That familiar knot in your stomach signals the impending arrival of exams, sleepless nights and caffeine overdose. Here are a few things you can do to help yourself:\n\nGet organised: Working backwards helps. If your exams are scheduled for May, make a schedule for revision and for practice. Sit with your subject teachers and plan your revision keeping in mind the date of the exam. Create a schedule by breaking it down into tiny chunks. But also make sure you have spare time to relax and unwind.\n\nMind your space: Blending our physical spaces is one of the biggest blunders. This has become more relevant now that we are all home bound. We work from homes, study in our bedrooms, eat on the bed and probably use the study table to dump stuff! It is important to respect the space so even your mind can dissociate. Designate an area where you will do all your studying and revising.\n\nExercise and eat a well-balanced diet: When you\u2019re under a lot of stress, exercising may seem like the last thing you want to do. But this guarantees that you will feel better later. It is also important to eat the right food during these high stress moments for mental health and wellness.\n\nYour phone can wait: Put your phone away while you are studying. The distraction of notifications from friends and checking Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms is the worst kind of procrastination. A bit of unchaining from the phone can do wonders for your stress levels.\n\nMock exams at home: One of the commonest causes for exam anxiety is lack of information about what to expect on the day of the exam. The best way to deal with this is practice and more practice. Time your at-home mocks. If you have trouble finishing on time, keep practising until you have nailed the timings. Seek feedback from your teachers. They can help you figure out which what areas can be improved further.\n\nBut remember, that success in the exam does not determine who you are. Everyone reacts differently in different circumstances. An exam just quantifies your knowledge.

There should be a government that stood for values and faith.\n\nLaw Minister A. K. Balan said the 2021 Assembly election was not a contest between believers and non-believers. Such a conclusion was reductive. There were more significant issues at stake. \u201cI have not heard the NSS general secretary. It is unlikely he will make such a statement,\u201d he said.\n\nSabarimala appeared to dominate the political narrative even on poll day. The emotive issue was the central plank of the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) campaigns.\n\nChief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said figuratively in Kannur that deities of the land, including Lord Ayyappa, would bless the Left Democratic Front (LDF) for ministering the people in the time of catastrophe.\n\nHis words drew reactions from across the political spectrum and pushed the subject to the fore as voting picked up pace across the State.\n\nSoon, Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala said in Alappuzha that the Chief Minister had attempted belatedly to \u201catone for his trespasses against the Ayyappa faith\u201d.\n\nVeteran Congress leader A. K. Antony said Mr. Vijayan should apologise to believers for \u201cdesecrating\u201d the Sabarimala temple by \u201cham-fistedly\u201d enacting the 2018 Supreme Court verdict permitting women, irrespective of their age, to worship at Sabarimala.\n\nFormer Chief Minister Oommen Chandy said Mr. Vijayan\u2019s invoking of Ayyappa faith was unconvincing. Sabarimala devotees would reject his election day overture.\n\nMr. Chandy said the LDF government had paved the way for the Supreme Court verdict by filing an affidavit backing women\u2019s entry. It had trashed the previous United Democratic Front (UDF) government\u2019s affidavit seeking the preservation of Sabarimala tradition and faith.\n\nIf Mr. Vijayan had honestly empathised with the sentiment of Ayyappa devotees, he should have withdrawn the current testimony and submitted the UDF\u2019s sworn statement in court, Mr. Chandy said.\n\nCPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran said the NSS general secretary might have crossed a line if confirmed that he had made a political statement on polling day.\n\n\u201cNo other social organisation leader had attempted to broadcast their political preference on voting day.

Sukumaran Nair's purported statement that Kerala direly needed a government that stood for values and beliefs.\n\n\n\nBJP State president K. Surendran said in Kasargode that Mr. Nair had given a clear message to the people. He had urged them to back those who had sacrificed much to defend the Sabarimala faith. The Narendra Modi government had extended reservation in government employment and education to the indigent among forward communities.\n\n\n\nMr. Surendran said Congress veterans A. K. Antony and Oommen Chandy were weeping crocodile tears for Sabarimala devotees. Both leaders turned their backs on devotees when the LDF government arrested them in large numbers and trampled upon their fundamental rights.\n\n\n\nMr. Antony had not uttered a whimper of protest against the assault on Sabarimala devotees. His expression of support for the Sabarimala cause was inherently insincere, Mr. Surendran said.\n\n\n\nChief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's Vijayan's police had secretly and rapidly conveyed \"activist women\" to Sabarimala Ayyappa temple under cover of darkness in 2018. His action was a direct affront to the faith of Ayyappa devotees, Mr. Surendran said.", "cat": "Kerala"},

You can subscribe for free here\n\nThe six-part limited series, hosted by Will Smith, follows the history of how the 14th Amendment \u2014 a part of the American Constitution still not fully understood by the majority \u2014 catalysed freedom fights, from Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr to Gloria Steinem, Ruth Bader Ginsberg and President Barack Obama. Amend also brims with archival footage, photographs, rendered animations and emotive narrations from academics such as historian Christopher Bonner, University of Maryland, and Prof Joanna Grossman, SMU Dedman School of Law.\n\nScoring for the project proved a complex experience for Essed, whose name is attached to documentaries such as Finders Keepers (2015), Emmy-winning Jim: The James Foley Story (2016), and Peabody-winning True Justice: Bryan Stevenson\u2019s Fight For Equality (2019).\n\nOver a video call the New York-based composer says, \u201cThere were so many moving parts and because there were four producers, there were a lot of conversations. Everyone working on Amend put so much of themselves into it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Everyone has a stake\u2019\n\nWhen Essed first signed on, there was talk of Will Smith being involved but as scoring and production progressed, other big names such as Mahershala Ali, Randall Park, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Yara Shahidi and Willow Smith joined the project. \u201cEveryone has a stake in the subject matter and the outcome, especially because the conversation around the 14th Amendment is not done,\u201d he insists. As a composer, he believes within the documentary space, his responsibility goes beyond just scoring \u2014 he is a part of the storytelling.\n\nRandall Park on the set of Netflix limited series \u2018Amend: The Fight for America\u2019 | Photo Credit: Netflix\n\nDue to the contemplative nature of the show, Essed leveraged restraint as a powerful tool to pull off a score that further immersed audiences. But he says this was liberating and he was able to experiment to stay within the parameters he set for himself. \u201cI just had to react to the dramatic arc of the stories,\u201d he explains, \u201cand we all had strong ideas about creating this in an honest way. I also had to be mindful, given the evolving diversity of America through these years, of how the music suited a certain group being represented, for example, with Operation Wetback [immigration law enforcement initiative created by Joseph Swing] and the Chinese Exclusion Act, we had to allow for the soundscape to react to these events, but subtly so. It still had to come from an American place which was just more truthful.\u201d\n\nIndia-made projects Essed also pitched in his skills for Academy Award-winning short documentary Period: End Of Sentence (2019). \u201cSeeing that kind of recognition of that scale, and watching the film and how it came together was wonderful,\u201d he comments. \u201cWorking a documentary, you don\u2019t get many opportunities to tell joyful stories that don\u2019t end up feeling like a commercial for something. But this is such a joyful story.\u201d\n\nThe series comprises a fair bit if source music as well, and Essed had to interact instinctively with these sounds. \u201cThe source music has its role, and as we transition through the series, we understand where we have to move on from it while treating those music pieces with respect and gentleness,\u201d he points out.\n\nSometimes, there is not even any score for certain scenes. \u201cThe most effective scores allow plenty of room for silence. There are so many pivots in this score, especially in two-minute sections. Taking breaths in between these dense moments is so important so that things can sink in,\u201d Essed points out.\n\nIn Amend, there are rendered animated visuals and scoring for those was an interesting process for Essed, \u201cIt was unique to dive into those sections which came later. When you\u2019re scoring for these different mediums (photographs, animations, explainers), you have to see what the filmmaker\u2019s vision is as well. You have to leave room for a lot of openness when you are scoring for something that is developed at the same time as your inputs.\u201d\n\nComposer Osei Essed\n\nWhen it comes to composing for films versus series, Essed says \u201cin a series, there are more bursts and switches between tones in short periods of time. In film, most of the stuff I have done has a bit more space.\u201d\n\nAsk Essed which iconic composer of the past would have been a great composer for a series like Amend and he responds, \u201cFrom an American point-of-view, it would be interesting to have a blend of Duke Ellington with perhaps Miles Davis. I wouldn\u2019t go back very far because storytelling has changed so much. If they were thrown into the modern day, they would probably ask \u2018what is going on?\u2019 But those guys could definitely rock it.\u201d\n\nEssed is thankful that Amend was released on a global OTT platform so that audiences can delve into simultaneous conversations about race, gender, immigration, freedom and more on an international scale. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling to know the true reach of it. Watching Amend for the first time as a finished product was amazing. Working in the documentary space, this series has some seriously well-reputed academics who I\u2019ve seen across other works, but here they are in one project,\u201d laughs Essed. Even more so, having been born in South America and being part of an immigrant family, he feels even more connected with the series.", "cat": "Music"},

Hooghly recorded highest 79.36 % polling percentage, followed by 77.93% in Howrah and 76.68% in South 24 Parganas.\n\nThe most distressing image of the day was the attack on the Trinamool Congress candidate from Arambagh, Sujata Modal Khan, who was chased by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters through paddy fields in the constituency for hundreds of metres. Videos shared by local television channels showed Ms. Khan being hit on her head and her security officer sustained injuries.

In the Goghat Assembly segment in Hooghly district, Madhabi Adak was allegedly killed while trying to save her son in the early hours on Tuesday. Her son filed a police complaint accusing TMC supporters of the attack.\n\nAt least one person was injured when crude bombs were hurled at Canning Purba Assembly segment. Saukat Mollah, the TMC candidate, blamed supporters of the Indian Secular Front for the attack and blocked the road leading to the polling booth.\n\nSeveral allegations were made by voters in the Bishnupur area of South 24 Parganas and Baghnan in Howrah.

Pant along with Marcus Stoinis and Shimron Hetmyer or Sam Billings will look to fill the hole left by Iyer in the middle order.\n\nThe addition of Steve Smith will further bolster their batting.\n\nDhawan (618) was the second highest run-scorer in 2020 and looked in good touch in the recent ODI series against England with scores of 98 and 67.\n\nShaw too will be itching to prove his worth after amassing 827 runs in the Vijay Hazare Trophy following his ouster from the Australia Test series and a dismal last season.\n\nPant has emerged as a match-winner for India in the recent series against Australia and England. He along with all-rounder Stoinis and Billings will have to ensure that DC finish with a flourish.\n\nOn the bowling front, South African pace duo of Kagiso Rabada (2020 purple cap winner) and Anrich Nortje has proved to a dream pair, having scalped 52 wickets together in 2020.\n\nWith Chris Woakes also in the mix this time and Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav also in the ranks, Delhi have options in their pace battery.\n\nWEAKNESS: Delhi's primary weakness is not having enough quality players in their ranks both overseas and home cricketers. Not having like-for-like replacements is one of the weak points.\n\nIt was precisely the reason they were not able to rest Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje. Even in terms of wicket-keeping, in case Pant has a niggle they didn't have replacement. This year they have Vishnu Vinod of Kerala but he is a green horn.\n\nAlso the Indian fast bowling is pretty weak as their two premier fast bowlers Ishant and Umesh don't play much white ball cricket for the national team now.\n\nOPPORTUNITIES: Although a big challenge, but it will also be a huge opportunity for young skipper Pant to step out of the shadows of the legendary MS Dhoni by guiding his team to its maiden title.\n\nThe league also provides Pant the opportunity to prepare for the T20 World Cup, where he will be a vital cog in India's batting line-up. Dhawan too will look to seal the opening slot, while it is also a chance for R Ashwin and Axar Patel to prepare for the ICC event.\n\nTHREAT: Pant has displayed resilience and understanding in his short career thus far but he will have to ensure that the added leadership responsibility doesn't affect his natural attacking instinct as a batsman.\n\nAlso DC's pace unit is too dependent on Rabada and Nortje with back-up pacers Ishant and Umesh not boasting of a great T20 record.\n\nLast year, Delhi suffered four successive losses after seven wins in first nine games, jeopardising their play-off chances.

The technicolor streaks of darting tropical fish flash less frequently. The rasping sounds of lobsters go quiet.\n\nWhile Cuba\u2019s marine life has suffered from overfishing and pollution, there is mounting evidence that the warming of waters due to climate change may be taking a large toll as well \u2014 both off the island\u2019s coast and globally.\n\nResearch published Monday finds that the total number of open-water species declined by about half in the 40 years up to 2010 in tropical marine zones worldwide.

In other words, scientists say, species that can move are moving.\n\n\u201cIn geological history, this has occurred in the blink of an eye,\u201d said Sebastian Ferse, an ecologist at the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research who was not involved with the study. \u201cTo see such changes occurring so rapidly is something quite alarming.\u201d\n\nFor fixed species like corals, moving is not an option.\n\n\u201cOne of the big questions is \u2018Will coral reefs as ecosystems and corals as species be able to move north or south enough fast enough to adjust to a changing climate?\u2019\u201d Ferse said.\n\nHaving fleets of fish and other swimmers shift rapidly to more temperate waters could devastate the coral ecosystems they leave behind \u2014 along with any fishing and tourism industries that rely on them.\n\nSuch changes \u201ccan have a really huge impact on some of the most vulnerable human communities around the planet,\u201d said Stuart Pimm, a conservation scientist at Duke University not involved in the study.\n\nFor Cuba, such an impact could unravel the island nation\u2019s efforts to manage its underwater gardens although its corals have been less stressed by coastal development and pollution than corals elsewhere. They are considered more resilient to ocean warming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive to return to an area that experienced significant bleaching the year before, but looks perfectly healthy a year later,\u201d said Daniel Whittle, who heads the Caribbean program at the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nCuba opened its first coral reef nursery four years ago to research which species coped best with warming and eventually to repopulate depleted reefs. The country is also restoring coastal mangroves, which serve as fish nurseries and shelter.\n\nChaudhary and her colleagues plan next to look at which tropical species were in decline or were migrating.", "cat": "Environment"},
