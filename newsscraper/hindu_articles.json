Delhi has also been facing issues, especially related to oxygen. I have spent nights in attempt to ensure oxygen supply to city hospitals,\u201d Mr. Kejriwal said.\n\nOxygen need\n\n\u201cAccording to Delhi government estimates, the city requires a daily supply of 700 tonnes of oxygen. The Centre had allocated a quota of 378 tonnes of oxygen to Delhi initially, but has increased that to 480 tonnes on Wednesday for which we are very, very thankful. Though it is lower than what is required, we are thankful,\u201d he also said.\n\nThe Centre, Mr. Kejriwal said, also decides which company supplies oxygen to States and cities such as Delhi, where oxygen is not manufactured. Oxygen manufactured by companies in other States is allocated to others according to the Centre\u2019s directions, he said.\n\nSome State governments, Mr. Kejriwal alleged, where such manufacturing units were located, had stopped the transportation of oxygen allocated to Delhi and used it themselves, given the circumstances and paucity of oxygen.\n\n\u201cI want to thank the Centre and the Delhi High Court for helping us with this issue. I, Delhi\u2019s Ministers and officers have not slept for several nights and were in constant touch with the Centre over the issue of oxygen supply,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut the increased supply will take some time and we are mulling airlifting oxygen from Odisha. In the meantime, I am personally ensuring that every truck with oxygen reaches its destination. Like I had promised, these six days are being utilised to ramp up our medical infrastructure as much as possible, round the clock,\u201d he also said.\n\nThe pandemic, Mr. Kejriwal said, was \u201ca very big emergency\u201d and everyone needed to come together to confront and defeat it.\n\nInstead of watching how supplies of essential resources were stopped by one State from reaching another, people wanted to see how these States were helping each other in this time of need, he said.\n\n\u201cI want to assure you as the Chief Minister of Delhi that I will share my resources with other States as soon as possible. We have to show the world how India, despite having the highest COVID-19 cases in the whole world, came together to fight and defeat this pandemic,\u201d he also said."},

Scared of their uncertain future, they find themselves a mere spent force and turn to listening to bhajans and puranas for solace.\n\nReports of those died of the virus getting \u2018orphan-like\u2019 funeral by the staff of the civic bodies, shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and blackmarketing of life-saving drugs and hefty hospital bills have left them shaken.\n\nMany of the elderly people are now seen at local temples, offering prayers, and spending time by doing bhajans and listening to puranas.

While the district is likely to get 30,000 doses initially, official sources said up to 65,000 doses could be expected.\n\nFollowing a lull caused by an acute shortage of vaccine doses, the vaccination programme is set to be on track with the health authorities scheduling the drive across 108 centres in the district on Friday.

Soon, the police streamlined the crowd by sending off those who had not booked online.\n\nA total of 2,931 vaccine doses were administered in the district on the day.

The hospital apparently told him that they have been trying to manage cylinders for the last three days but were unable to arrange.\n\nWith other senior officers in tow, he rushed to the hospital and spoke to the management, who were panicking because lives of more than 350 patients were in their hands.\n\nThe first task was to identify where they could procure the oxygen from, as the hospital required liquid oxygen tankers. Teams then identified that one oxygen tanker was travelling to GTB Hospital. \u201cBut at that crucial point, the driver wasn\u2019t picking the call. We had to trace him and almost intercept him,\u201d he recalled. The team then went to GTB Hospital with the tanker before bringing it to the Batra Hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, police got another lead that an oxygen tanker was coming from Haryana\u2019s Samalkha. But the old hassle surfaced. The driver\u2019s traced location didn\u2019t match with what he was saying. He was finally found in West Delhi and brought to Batra Hospital.\n\n\u201cAmid all this, we were informed that the oxygen had completely run out and some patients were having seizures. The pressure was mounting. Around 12.30 a.m., Samalkha tanker reached and by 1 a.m., the one from GTB too came. We helped them with seven tonnes of oxygen,\u201d he said, adding that over 100 policemen were involved in this mission for five to six hours.\n\nOne hurdle after other\n\nReflecting on the situation, a senior officer termed coordinating as the toughest challenge, besides pointing out that supplies are disrupted as more oxygen is required but there is no arrangement to meet the demands.\n\n\u201cPlanning for the second wave was not conducted in terms of oxygen and hospital requirement. There is a huge lack of a tracking system, which would make oxygen supply smooth and check consignment,\u201d he said.\n\nProduction of oxygen has not been enhanced as it should have been and internal disputes of several stakeholders appears to have lead to this chaos, sources said of their opinion after observing ground situation. Sources said that many officers are infected in the force and for some, their families are infected due to which they need leaves which seniors can\u2019t deny.\n\n\u201cMuch of our resources are diverted to the healthcare situation while we have to ensure the lockdown is imposed and guidelines are followed,\u201d an officer said.\n\nAdditional DCP (Outer) Sudhanshu Dhama has been attending distress calls for the last few days. The latest was from Rathi Hospital, who were in a dire situation on Wednesday evening with lives of 78 patients at stake. Mr. Dhama, who was in the hospital till around 3a.m. on Thursday, along with his teams, managed to arrange 120 oxygen cylinders from Bawana, Kanjhawala, Mayapuri and even from another hospital.\n\n\u201cWe had to plead with other hospitals,\u201d he said, adding that hospitals are scared to help because of the fear of cylinders running out.\n\nThe police are stretched, but they keep on helping the city breathe. \u201cAt this point, one cannot say this is not my job because the situation is such. One cannot demarcate. Right now, we are providing help by whatever means we can,\u201d he said.\n\nDCP (North) Anto Alphonse, who had arranged oxygen for NKS Hospital from Mayapuri by going in person, said his control room has been attending to PCR calls from people calling for hospital beds, life-saving injections, oxygen cylinders and even ration. He said they are trying their best to meet their needs while adding that coordinating for oxygen with suppliers is a task at the moment, he said.\n\nCoordination pangs\n\nPranav Tayal, DCP (Rohini), also said that coordinating with gas agencies for oxygen and then providing it in that short span of time to the hospitals is challenging. \u201cWe arranged 50 oxygen cylinders for a private hospital and they were delivered in two hours. They were arranged from Bawana and Khanjhawala,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the data shared by Delhi Police, only 5-10 officials were testing positive till April 4. But the numbers soared to 263 on April 20. There was marginal respite, as it came down to 193 on Wednesday."},

She says pledges by various countries to halve greenhouse gas emissions over the next decade are insufficient.\n\nBiden has called for replacing fossil fuel subsidies with incentives for clean energy production as part of his infrastructure plan, but the plan has not specified which tax breaks for fossil fuel companies would be targeted.\n\nKhanna listed some tax breaks he wants repealed, including one called intangible drilling costs, which allows producers to deduct most costs from drilling new wells."},

Friedrich\u2019s ataxia starts during childhood and manifests later as impaired muscular coordination that worsens with age. It is caused by an inherited aberrant gene.\n\nWe all carry two copies of every gene, each inherited from a parent. Friedrich\u2019s ataxia occurs when both copies of the FXN gene have the defect. The defective FXN gene causes a problem in producing a protein called frataxin, which is found in cells throughout the body, with the highest levels in the heart, spinal cord, liver, pancreas, and muscles used for voluntary movement.\n\nThe article described how the researchers had identified a way to tag the defective part of the gene and bind it so that frataxin can be produced normally. This was done in cell lines in the lab, and treatment of people with the problem was still some distance away.\n\nI got a few emails after this article was published asking me for the contact details of the researchers. These emails mentioned that relatives were suffering from Friedrich\u2019s ataxia and that perhaps the research would hold the key. This was not surprising or new \u2014 research kindles hope for patients and their relatives who often reach out asking for more details.\n\nBut what did surprise me was the recent email I got, where the writer was emailing to know more \u2014 it came three years after the article was published.\n\nThis touched me on several counts. First, it brought home the thirst for scientific knowledge and the eagerness to probe and understand complex phenomena, among the readers. It was moving to think of the reader scouring the web for information that could help a loved one. Successful research, promising results and reactions of hope are what make it worth the while for science journalists who spend their time trying to make sense of the abstruse and simplifying it for the lay reader.\n\nSecond, the email underscored the reach of the medium of the Internet and the power of the published word. This reinforces in us journalists the need for rigour and commitment to facts in the reports we write. The role of the Internet in prolonging the life of stories is well known, but the ease with which a person can access an old story and also mail the writer for an update never fails to astonish.\n\nIn earlier days, when print was the dominant mode of communication, the combination of the short life span of stories and the time it took to establish communication with the writer worked to prevent such easy links between the reader, writer and the written. Back then, letters were the dominant mode of communication, and people travelled across the globe to confer, whereas now, instant messaging and Zoom conferences have made discussions easy to organise.\n\nThe Internet has taken us from daily, weekly and monthly schedules to round-the-clock planning. It has also played a role in amplifying and making immortal the written word. For reporters, it is an added responsibility to use the power of this medium in a manner consistent with journalistic values."},

People at both ends of the classroom seem to be going through a mere exercise with precious little to show for their efforts. How much of learning is happening is anyone\u2019s guess. Exams have lost their credibility. The cost to health with continuous exposure to screens and the dent on financial resources are significant for both teachers and students. Online learning seems to be a case of working mindlessly, rather than working smart.\n\nWith physical classes out of the reckoning, access to education is now almost exclusively online. Internet penetration in India is 50% and that reveals one reason for the less-than-efficient achievement in the online education sector. Every single teacher-educator and student, even in the metros, has experienced poor connectivity. In the rural areas online access remains an aspiration. What happens to that child in the village government school, eager to learn but with no proper access to the Internet? Even if there is a selfless teacher who is willing to use his/her mobile hotspot, how much can he/she spend? The government has a solution right in its backyard.\n\nAlso read | Study highlights online education woes\n\nTwo influential agencies\n\nThe Government of India owns the airwaves. Prasar Bharati is India\u2019s broadcasting corporation handling both radio and television in India. All India Radio (AIR) is blessed with 470 broadcasting centres which cover 92% of the country\u2019s geographical area and 99.19% of our population. Doordarshan (DD) handles television, online and mobile broadcasting across our country and the world with 34 satellite channels, 17 well-equipped studios in State capitals and 49 studio centres in other cities. With such resources, AIR and DD can be used to broadcast lessons, given that education is one of the three functions of the two agencies under the Prasar Bharati Act. These two agencies can be reinvented to cater to the needs of the education sector.\n\nEducational broadcasts for classes 10, 11 and 12, to begin with, can be done over AIR and DD in the ratio 4:1 (four hours of radio and one hour of TV). Those courses which need demonstration and where seen/observed physical activity is important can be broadcast on TV. This calls for some training and some effort, but it can be done.\n\nThere are two benefits from this: one, we will be able to reduce for our teachers and students the strain of having to stare at their screens endlessly; and two, with AIR and DD being free, the heavy drain on financial resources will be drastically reduced.\n\nAlso read | Pros and cons of online education, from a student\u2019s perspective\n\nPolicymakers should make it a point to involve teachers in their planning. Training can be provided by a set of master trainers over a month for teachers who will turn into scriptwriters and programmers. These teachers can also be taught to create appropriate tools for evaluation over radio and TV. The Central and State educational boards should be roped in, to support, monitor and provide feedback to improve the system.\n\nIf regular radio is not enough, we also have digital radio spawning FM stations leased out to private players for a fee and several FM stations that are run by NGOs, universities and such agencies. My suggestion is this: let the AIR devote four hours (per class) to educational broadcasting and let DD undertake educational broadcasting for an hour (per class). With these two public broadcasting services combined in the ratio of 4:1 (per each class), we will be able to serve the entire student population of our country.\n\nAlso Read Amid online classes, schools devise digital detox routine\n\nFree hours of Internet\n\nAnother suggestion that the government could consider is to ask Internet Service Providers to provide many hours of free Internet usage to teachers and students. This will not be easy but the government should call the shots and take a decision that is in the interest of the people.\n\nJohn Varghese is Principal, St Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi"},

While the application on which it has been working has become obsolete, it has seen increased load over the years without any upgrade.\n\nWhen the system was developed in 2003, Kaveri application was meant to handle just about 10 modules, including document registration, property valuation, marriage registration, encumbrance search, and scanning archives among others. \u201cAs it successfully demonstrated its capacity, new tasks were imposed on it. In 17 years, about 20 more tasks that were not originally conceived have been added without any upgrade,\u201d a senior Revenue official told The Hindu.\n\nAlmost every day there is some technical issue in one of the integration applications belonging to other departments, which were not part of the original module, he rued.\n\nThe Kaveri system that is now critical in the land management system has been witnessing frequent shutdowns in the last few months with at least four reported Statewide shutdowns that brought registrations to a standstill.\n\nKaveri 1 is running on VB platform and Win XP operating system, both of which do not get the update support of Microsoft since they have become outdated. The decentralised system is further affected since the old hardware and inefficient power back up delays restoration of data due to maintenance efficiency of 282 local servers located in each office.\n\nSources pointed out apart from the original tasks, Kaveri now supports land related integrations from other departments such as Bhoomi, Mojini, e-Swathu, Upor, e-Aasthi, Sakala, Udyoga Mitra Portal, Khajane II, Moulya, Digilocker, BDA, BBMP, and PAN verification services. \u201cNot much focus is being given to upgrade the application or bring a new system that is robust and can handle newer integrations,\u201d said the source.\n\nOver the last five years, the Stamps and Registrations Department\u2019s transaction in over 280 sub-registrar\u2019s office alone has seen an increase. The number of documents registered has gone up from 19.71 lakh in 2015-2016 to 20.45 lakh in 2019-2020. In the same period, marriage registrations have increased from 1.21 lakh to 1.49 lakh, encumbrance certificates 27.75 lakh to 36.79 lakh, CCs from 6.86 lakh to 8.07 lakh.\n\nAnother officer said Kaveri was never meant to be interactive, but made partially interactive in the recent years. \u201cIt was meant to bring convenience in registrations. The number of steps used in registrations have gone from about 5 to 22 now. Ambitious plans such as sending OTP to the user during registrations has added pressure. To generate one OTP, the application makes about 15 communications that adds to the stress.\u201d\n\nWhy is NIC application not being considered?\n\nA National Generic Document Registration System (NGDRS) developed by National Informatics Centre is available free of cost for the State struggling with Kaveri.\n\nAccording to government sources, it has been found that the free property registration related application has been adopted in eight States, and States such as Maharashtra and Telangana are considering it too. Sources said that Karnataka is part of the NGDRS committee, but has so far not considered the application for adoption. \u201cThis can be adopted within a month across the State and is expected to provide a permanent solution to the existing problem. Moreover, it is a free application,\u201d said the source. The Centre for Smart Governance has been tasked with developing a new system to handle the existing and future needs. A revenue official said that it may be a year\u2019s time before the new system can go live. \u201cTill then, the daily fire-fighting continues.\u201d"},

This automatic system delivers supplement oxygen based on the SpO2 levels and prevents the person from sinking in to a state of \u2018hypoxia\u2019, which is fatal in most cases.\n\nHypoxia is a state in which the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues is inadequate to fulfil all the energy requirements of the body. This is exactly the situation that a COVID patient may face leading to the current crisis, informed an official release.\n\nThe electronic hardware of the system is designed for functioning at extreme altitudes featuring low barometric pressures, low temperatures and humidity. The software safety checks incorporated into the system are critical in ensuring the functional reliability of the system in field conditions.\n\nThe system reads SpO2 levels of the subject from a wrist-worn pulse oximeter module through wireless interface and controls a proportional solenoid valve to regulate the oxygen supply. The oxygen is delivered from a lightweight portable cylinder through nasal prongs.\n\nThe system is available in various sizes from 1 litre and 1kg weight with 150 litres of oxygen supply to 10 litres and 10 kg weight with 1,500 litres of oxygen supply, which can sustain for 750 minutes with a continuous flow of two litres per minute. Since the system is indigenously developed for operation in field conditions, it is robust, cheap and already in bulk production.\n\nThe system can be used in the household for moderate COVID patients requiring oxygen flow therapy with flow controlled at 2/5/7/10 litres per minute. The automatic usage has huge advantage in the household, as the oximeter would give an alarm for lower SpO2 value. It will automatically increase/decrease the O2 flow based on SpO2 setting, which can be auto adjusted at 2,5,7,10 litres per minute flow rate.\n\nThe simple-to-use facility greatly reduces the work load and exposure time of doctors and paramedics to monitor the SpO2 levels of patients.

After the tenure of former CJI Ranjan Gogoi, who oversaw the Ayodhya and Rafale verdicts, before retiring to join the Rajya Sabha, we thought the worst was behind us. We hoped that his successor, CJI S.A. Bobde would lift the Court out of this abyss and at least restore its independence from the executive. But, the nearly 18 months of his tenure has exposed a deep malaise in every aspect of dispensation of justice; from the administration of the Court; in the allocation of cases and benches; to presiding over matters related to the protection of civil liberties, securing the rights and the livelihood of the poor and marginalised; or in ensuring that the unconstitutional actions and policies of the executive are kept in check.\n\nMomentous months\n\nHis tenure began in November 2019 with many important cases before him. There were over 100 petitions challenging the dilution of Article 370 and the reorganisation of the State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) into Union Territories. Soon after he assumed office, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed, which led to another spate of petitions challenging its constitutionality. The CAA sparked widespread protests. We witnessed police confrontation at the Jamia University campus and the entry of gangs into Jawaharlal Nehru University who beat up students and teachers under the full gaze of the police. Thereafter, the city of Delhi witnessed engineered riots and the subsequent hounding of young students and other activists in the guise of an investigation by the Delhi Police. There were also other important cases pending before the Supreme Court, including the validity of electoral bonds, and the protection of Rohingya refugees. Then, early in 2020, COVID-19 overtook the country, and with it began the lockdown of the Supreme Court and thereafter other courts, and then the entire country \u2014 which led to the largest exodus of migrant labour from the large cities in India.\n\nA powerful constitutional court like the Supreme Court of India must rise to these challenges, and it is in such challenging times that its mettle and independence is tested. It is here that the role of the Chief Justice of India \u2014 he is the master of the roster deciding the priority accorded to the hearing of cases, their allocation to Benches and setting the tone for the Court by his leadership \u2014 becomes critical.\n\nThe cases challenging the cataclysmic changes to the status of J&K remained unheard during his entire tenure as did the cases challenging the CAA. The main challenge to the electoral bonds and other changes to electoral funding, which have a fundamental bearing on our democracy, remained unheard. Applications for the stay of bonds being issued before every election, were never listed for hearing, and were eventually dismissed on the ground that the bonds had been around for several years; therefore, there was no need to stay them. Similarly, the main petition regarding the status of the Rohingya refugees and the protection to be accorded to them, remained unheard. An application to prevent their detention and deportation, was disposed of by Chief Justice Bobde, in complete disregard of constitutional and international law norms, on the basis that their fleeing genocide in Myanmar did not concern the Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court, under his stewardship, remained shut for physical hearing much of the time, resulting in fewer than 25% cases being heard in a Court, already reeling under a backlog and pendency of cases. Many habeas corpus petitions of people in detention were not heard for months, and thereafter summarily disposed of without deciding the main issue by relegating the petitioners to the High Courts.\n\nMigrant labour exodus\n\nDuring the nationwide lockdown last year, the country witnessed unprecedented suffering by migrant labour; there was a mass exodus of them from the big cities, and they suffered a huge loss of livelihood and income. Without any public transport, they were forced to walk hundreds of miles to reach their villages. Their case for relief in terms of food, wages and transport was initially heard by the CJI\u2019s Bench. Unfortunately, the pleas on behalf of the migrant workers did not result in any relief to them with the Court saying it could not \u201csupplant\u201d the government\u2019s wisdom on providing relief to the lakhs of migrant labourers across the country. The CJI remarked infamously during one of the hearings, \u201cIf they are being provided meals, then why do they need money?\u201d It would be no exaggeration to say that the Court\u2019s inhumanity and apathy towards the distress of the poor and marginalised reached its nadir during this time.\n\nFar from being a custodian of citizens\u2019 rights, CJI Bobde, while hearing the Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan\u2019s habeas corpus petition (arrested while covering the infamous Hathras rape and murder case in Uttar Pradesh), noted that the Court had been discouraging people from approaching it under Article 32 (https://bit.ly/3n92Ym1). Mr. Kappan\u2019s petition remained pending with repeated adjournments.\n\nIn the farmers\u2019 protest case, the CJI appointed a committee of people, whose political neutrality was suspect, to examine the issues and commence negotiations with the farmers. These committee members had publicly supported the farm laws in the past.\n\nAdministrative role\n\nApart from his role as the master of the roster, the CJI also plays a pivotal role in judicial appointments. Unfortunately, here too, he failed to carry the collegium with him, leading to no appointments to the Supreme Court during his tenure, and very few appointments even to the High Courts. He did not even order the government to issue notifications for the appointment of judges where the collegium had unanimously reiterated its recommendations, despite the government procrastinating over them for long. The law laid down by the Court says that these are binding on the government.\n\nThe Chief Justice of India also plays a critical role in dealing with complaints against judges. During his tenure, the CJI received a serious complaint made by a Chief Minister of a State against one of the Court judges, with considerable documentary evidence of questionable land purchases. For over six months, the people in the country were not informed how the complaint had been dealt with, and whether any in-house committee (as per the law) has been appointed to, who the members of the committee were, and what their report was.\n\nThe same lack of transparency was visible in another case, where he was chairman of a committee examining allegations of harassment made by a woman staffer of the Court against his predecessor. His report, purporting to give a clean chit to his predecessor, was never allowed to see the light of day and not even provided to the complainant.\n\nGreen cause\n\nI have tried to search for the redeeming features in the CJI\u2019s tenure. But to my dismay, the only positive intervention by CJI Bobde that I have been able to discover was his order in the West Bengal trees case (https://bit.ly/3na6752), where he appointed an expert committee to examine the value of trees which are to be felled for any public project. In all other issues, the CJI has only caused disappointment with his silence, letting the executive have its way and even making strong remarks on sensitive issues and subjects. He has kept important matters pending, and has hardly intervened to provide any relief to the most marginalised or the weak in India.\n\nAs we bid farewell to Chief Justice of India Bobde, the Supreme Court must examine what has happened to what had once been called the most powerful court in the world and a beacon for many other courts across the world. As the Supreme Court turns the page on his tenure, let us hope that in the coming years, it can rebuild its legacy by asserting its judicial independence from the government and once again reclaiming its constitutional role as a citadel that establishes India\u2019s constitutional values, guards its democracy, and protects human rights and dignity.\n\nPrashant Bhushan is a senior public interest advocate practising at the Supreme Court of India"},

Apart from a coherent plea to States to avoid total lockdowns and a romantic COVID-19 situational briefing of sorts, much of it was optimistic yet stultifying rhetoric that could hardly have any influence on mass behaviour towards COVID-19. Nonetheless, while much of the visual aspect of the Prime Minister\u2019s address was similar to the ones held last year, one conspicuous element was missing \u2014 that of a symbolic mask. While a number of alibis for the same are possible, it is an insignia that speaks volumes about our approach toward the second wave of COVID-19.\n\nAdministrative fatigue\n\nMedicine and social science are two essential pillars of public health. However, medical interventions have historically been the ones to usurp the public health space. Much to the detriment of public health, this has time and again resulted in a subconscious dismissal of social science-based approaches that hold the keys to the public health castle. The situation with the second wave is hardly different. In our besottedness with strategies such as mass vaccination, which although of unrivalled significance have considerable near-term limitations, the simplest yet most crucial behavioural interventions have been given a criminally light touch at a time when they were supposed to be accentuated.\n\nAnd this goes beyond the abomination of political rallies potentially spreading infection, or public representatives failing at crucial public messaging by not wearing masks themselves. Take the instance of a mofussil town that no longer sees honking vehicles traverse the streets every morning, airing social distancing and masking messages, unlike during the first wave. Or the near-disappearance after the first wave of rings drawn outside of a shopping store to encourage social distancing. Surmount these with counter-intuitive public policies at the grass-roots level, and you have a perfect recipe for a flaring pandemic.\n\nFor example, even before an official order was promulgated in Maharashtra, local police forced shops to remain open for only four hours during the day in certain localities, creating panic among customers and shopkeepers. The idea of limiting open-hours derives from the theoretical precept of rationing services to discourage over-consumption, much like waiting times. But the same fosters over-crowding, non-compliance with COVID-19-appropriate behaviour by both shopkeepers and customers, and is practically counterproductive when an infectious pandemic is in question.\n\nSimilarly, it is possible to locate beneficiaries lined up outside some vaccination centres from midnight till noon for physical tokens, while the politically well-connected get their way within minutes. All of these indicate that much like pandemic fatigue among the public, administrative and governance fatigue is real, and that the crucial lessons from the early days of the pandemic have been squandered rather than strengthened.\n\nPoor messaging\n\nAnother example of administrative fatigue, resulting from a subconscious dismissal of behavioural approaches, is the poor risk communication and public messaging that has accompanied the second wave. Health behaviours, once firmly embedded, are expected to be swiftly elicited on subsequent occasions. The concept is much like immunological memory where the body exerts a stronger response to a disease agent upon the second or third infection. Such embedded health behaviours in some East Asian countries have resulted in prompt and widespread public adoption of measures such as masking on the whiff of an infectious outbreak. The same cannot be expected for India given our lesser exposure to infectious pandemics. Nonetheless, a strong and subtle nudge was imperative during the second wave to quickly bring back COVID-19-appropriate behaviours with renewed vigour. This has failed, and that too during more pressing times than before.\n\nAs is often humorously exclaimed, the worst way to calm someone down is by telling them to calm down. Reducing the risk communication strategy to simple messages such as \u201cplease wear masks\u201d is unlikely to work particularly in a setting of widespread pandemic fatigue, and where mixed signals are continuously disseminated by political representatives. Altering health behaviour, in addition to altering physical and social contexts, involves skilful and emphatic messaging that incentivises adoption of the right behaviours. Unfortunately, the public health messaging strategy during the second wave has been more generic, muffled, and far more equivocal than the first wave.\n\nA perspective\n\nAn over-medicalised public health emergency is a disaster superimposed on another. Multiple fundamental aspects of COVID-19 vaccines and the protection afforded by them still remain fuzzy. Further, there are non-negotiable aspects such as the lag between vaccination and protection, and the gargantuan challenge of vaccinating a large population as ours. Overcoming our preoccupation with medical solutions and looking at behavioural approaches as more than mere rituals will be imperative to combat this second wave.\n\nDr. Soham D.

If we can ramp up the RT-PCR testing facilities, ensure results in shortest possible time and begin medication as per doctors\u2019 advice, online or mobile too, we can not only save lives but prevent the rush to hospitals in critical stages. If private labs have managed to enhance their capabilities in the last one year, what prevents the government to scale them up?,\u201d he asks.\n\nThe official is of the opinion that more people are voluntarily coming forward for testing this year. So, the health department on its own or on a public-private partnership should open more testing centres and provide quicker results to cut the serpentine queues in government healthcare facilities.\n\n(Readers can share their own experiences or suggest healthcare improvements on our Twitter handle @THHyderabad or mail them to hyderabaddesk@thehindu.co.

He also pointed out to partiality towards Gujarat, and neglect towards Telangana.\n\nRemdesivir is manufactured by at least two companies in and around Hyderabad. Till Wednesday, the State was procuring it directly. Mr. Rajender said that the Central government had issued an order on April 21 stating that they would take control over Remdesivir injections, other vaccines and oxygen.\n\n\u201cThis is so saddening,\u201d he said. Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan was informed of the issue, but there was no response.\n\nHe said that while the State was allotted only 21,551 vials of Remdesivir, Gujarat was allotted 1.63 lakh vials, Maharashtra 2 lakh vials, 61,000 to Delhi, and 92,000 to Madhya Pradesh.\n\n60-70% from other States\n\nMr. Rajender said that around 60-70% of patients admitted in hospitals in Hyderabad were from other States. Usually, patients from Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Maharashtra get admitted to hospitals in the city.\n\nThe Minister mentioned this to drive home the point that patients from various States get treated in the city, and meagre allocation of the antiviral drug or other resources would create a crisis.\n\n\u201cWe cannot impose a condition to admit patients only from our State. As the entire nation is in crisis, it is our responsibility to treat patients from everywhere. They should not face any issues. We placed order for 4 lakh vials of Remdesivir. I will write a letter to Union Health Minister,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, Telangana requires around 260-270 metric tonnes of oxygen per day, and the demand may go up to 350 metric tonnes per day, he said. Mr. Rajender said that oxygen was procured from other States, not from Telangana.\n\nAround 20 metric tonnes of oxygen is procured from Bellary, 30 more from Hospet, 20 from Chennai and 84 from Odisha.\n\n\u201cGetting oxygen from places as far as 1,300 km is difficult. Special tankers are needed for that. We asked Dr. Harsh Vardhan to allocate oxygen from nearby places like Visakhapatnam, Sriperumbudur, and Bellary. If the Central government does not change its stance, it will have to take responsibility if there is any shortage,\u201d he said.\n\nVaccine crunch\n\nShortage of COVID vaccines too, was pointed out at the presser. The Health Minister said that had vaccine production been increased, we would not have seen the shortage. He said that Chief Minister K.

Between 45,000 and 54,000 other casualties were \u201ccommemorated unequally.\u201d\n\nThe treatment of these soldiers, who served in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, contrasts with that of the men and women who died in Europe. It also violates the principle that all war dead should be remembered in the same way because they all made the same enormous sacrifice.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government, both of the time and today, I want to apologize for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation,\u201d Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said in the House of Commons. \u201cWhilst we can\u2019t change the past, we can make amends and take action.\u201d\n\nThe commission was created in 1917 to ensure that all who died in the service of the British Empire during World War I were identified and properly honored. Its responsibilities were later expanded to include those who died during World War II, and it now oversees the graves of 1.7 million men and women who died during the two wars.\n\nThe commission appointed an independent panel to investigate claims of unequal treatment following a 2019 TV documentary presented by David Lammy, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, that focused on the way African casualties were commemorated. One researcher who worked on the documentary said she had forwarded information about her concerns to the commission more than a decade earlier but no action was taken.\n\nThe investigation found that tens of thousands of service personnel who died in Africa, Asia and the Middle East either weren\u2019t commemorated at all or were only honored anonymously on collective memorials. Others had their names recorded on paper registers rather than stone monuments. The battlefield graves of thousands more were abandoned without the remains ever being identified.\n\nIn Europe, the commission attempted to identify all of the dead and bury their remains under identical white headstones that still dot cemeteries from France to Turkey. The names of those who couldn\u2019t be identified were recorded on mass memorials.\n\n\u201cNo apology can ever make up for the indignity suffered by the unremembered,\u2033 Lammy said. \u201cHowever, this apology does offer the opportunity for us as a nation to work through this ugly part of our history \u2014 and properly pay our respects to every soldier who has sacrificed their life for us.\u201d\n\nDavid Olusoga, a professor of public history at the University of Manchester, said World War I changed British culture, in part because of the powerful way that the dead were remembered.\n\n\u201c(Yet) when it came to men who were black and brown and Asian and African, it is not equal. Particularly the Africans, who have been treated in a way that is \u2026 apartheid in death,\u2033 he told the BBC. \u201cIt is an absolute scandal.\u201d\n\nThe inequality was rooted in the \u201cimperial ideology\u201d of British and colonial authorities in the years immediately after World War I, the investigation found. For instance, the officer in charge of graves registration in East Africa asserted that central memorials were the most appropriate way to commemorate the dead because most Africans \u201cdo not attach any sentiment\u201d to the graves of their dead.\n\n\u201cSweeping judgements such as these, which chose to ignore the intricacies of faith, culture and customs in Africa outside Christian and Islamic traditions, played a significant role in shaping the (commission\u2019s) policies that led to unequal treatment,\u201d the panel said.\n\nThese attitudes were adopted at the highest levels of the British government. Winston Churchill, then-Secretary of State for the Colonies, in 1921 signed a document directing that collective memorials, rather than individual headstones, should be erected for African troops in Africa.\n\nIn response to the panel\u2019s findings, the commission said it would continue to search for the names of African, Asian and Middle Eastern casualties and add their names to its records. It also promised to be more flexible in the evidence required to support requests for commemoration in light of the panel\u2019s concerns about the availability of paper records.\n\nThe commission also said it would improve transparency about this issue on its website and set up an expert panel to advise it.\n\n\u201cWe apologize unreservedly for the historical wrongs found in this report and for failing to live up to founding principle, of `equality of treatment in death,\u2019\u201d the commission said."}
