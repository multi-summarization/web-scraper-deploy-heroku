But there is no urgency amongst people though cases are climbing,\u201d an official said.\n\nHowever, some district health administrations said the lukewarm response last week was because of the polls. With the election over, vaccination would pick up. \u201cThere is no crowding because it has now been made available right from primary health centres upwards and in a lot more private hospitals,\u201d a district official said.\n\n\u201cWe need the whole-hearted involvement of LSGI officials to take vaccination ahead. All of last week, they were involved in the poll affairs. And people were reluctant to take the shots fearing that they might be laid up with fever or other side-effects and miss participating in the election activities. We hope vaccination will pick up pace in a week,\u201d K. Sakeena, district medical officer, Malappuram, said.\n\nMedia reports about even vaccinated people getting COVID infection have created confusion among the public and some sceptical questions on why one should get vaccinated if it is not to free people from a restricted life are questions health officials are facing in the field.\n\nFor the public, weary of the restrictions imposed by the pandemic, messages that they should continue to wear mask regardless of their vaccination status have been quite confusing.\n\n\u201cThe messages on how vaccines can change the course of the pandemic and what should be expected after vaccination should be conveyed more lucidly to people. No vaccine gives an assurance that it can prevent all infections. But all vaccines give 100% assurance against serious disease, hospitalisation, and death. There have been very few infections in people who completed at least three weeks after their first vaccine dose. Though a few infections were reported in fully vaccinated healthcare workers, these were all mild and asymptomatic infections,\u201d a health expert said.\n\nThe pandemic could be prolonged if people refuse to get vaccinate. If vaccination pace does not pick up and reach at least 70 % of the population, disease transmission may not reduce and will lead to the emergence of more mutant variants.\n\n\u2018Less infectious\u2019\n\nScientists still do not know for sure if a vaccinated person can transmit infection to others. But there are research studies which suggest that even if a vaccinated person contracts COVID-19, he may be less infectious.\n\nA research study from Israel reported that people who had been administered Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and who contracted COVID afterwards, had lower viral loads than unvaccinated people who caught the infection.\n\nLower viral load indicates that the person is less contagious and with sufficient coverage in the population, vaccination can reduce transmission, it is hoped."},

Two women, who are allegedly part of the racket, were arrested on Monday.\n\nThe accused, Devi Shanmugam from Wilson Garden and Ranjana Devidas from Hongasandra, were caught red-handed while handing over a month-old baby, Kajol, to undercover women police personnel.\n\nSub-Inspector Srinivasa K.R. from Talaghatapura, who led the operation that busted the gang, said they had been alerted that the women were selling a baby girl. An undercover team approached Devi seeking to buy the child. Devi reportedly claimed that she could get them a child from Mumbai for a price of \u20b93 lakh. She asked them to come to Majestic railway station with the cash on Monday.\n\nThe police filled the bag with currency notes and old newspaper bundles. When they met Devi at the station, she asked them to wait for a few minutes. Soon, a couple walked towards them and handed over the baby.\n\nSrinivas and his team immediately caught the couple, Shankar Damodar Nayar and his wife Sunitha Nayar. \u201cThey hail from Airoli in Thane and work as labourers. They claimed to have three children, and Kajol was their fourth child. They were living in poverty. Ranjana approached them with an offer. She promised them money if they gave her Kajol. She promised them that the baby would be taken in by a rich couple in Bengaluru and had a bright future ahead of her,\u201d said Srinivas. Ranjana convinced the couple and brought them to the city to hand over Kajol to Devi.\n\nSunitha and Kajol are currently at the State Home for Women while her husband has returned to take care of their other children. \u201cThey are victims, too, and will be counselled,\u201d said the police.\n\nDevi and Ranjana have been taken into 10 days\u2019 custody for further investigation.\n\n\u201cThe probe revealed that the duo have been running this racket for some time and have sold many children.

COVID infected persons in Dharmapuri also did not cast their right to vote for the fear of stigma of being seen in a PPE.\n\nWhile the disabled, and the very aged struggled their way to the polling stations to exercise their franchise, COVID patients quarantined in their homes failed to turn up at the polling stations, even as they had expressed their interest to vote.

It expected to increase its tally in Thiruvananthapuram and defeat the BJP in Nemom.\n\nThe coalition has put much stock in the Kerala Congress (M) to make gains in Kottayam and Idukki.

It has sensed a political drift in its favour. Sabarimala had billowed its sails. The LDF\u2019s alleged attempt to open the seas to foreign trawlers had manifested as a powerful headwind. Rahul Gandhi\u2019s campaigning would tip the balance in favour of the UDF.\n\nThe Congress has tried hard to make a comeback in Kollam, Alappuzha and Thrissur. It expected a surge in its popularity in Kozhikode, Kottayam, and Idukki.\n\nThe BJP has narrowed down its victory chances to less than five constituencies. However, it felt it had emerged as a decisive third force and made significant inroads into the Christian community\u2019s electoral bastions in central and southern Kerala.\n\nThe National Democratic Alliance has high hopes for Nemom, Kazhakuttam, Konni, Malampuzha, and Manjeswaram.\n\nAt least two pre-poll surveys had accorded an electoral advantage to the LDF.

Many South-bound trains originate in the morning and terminate at the Kacheguda station. But, it is very difficult to reach Kacheguda as there are no connecting local trains from any corner and passengers have to depend on private transport, he said.\n\nRailway authorities can consider running DEMU trains on Medchal-Malkajgiri-Secunderabad section or \u2018modify\u2019 the track at Sitaphalmandi to ensure that the trains are run between Sitaphalmandi-Bolarum to avoid waiting at outer signal.

The decline in the polling would benefit the Left Democratic Front (LDF) as a huge number of United Democratic Front (UDF) voters had kept away from voting owing to internal issues in the Congress, Mr. Gagarin claimed.\n\nIn Sulthan Bathery segment, nearly 7,000 voters failed to cast their votes but the number of voters in Mananthavady and Kalpetta segments were almost equal comparing with the 2016 polls, Mr. Gagarin said.\n\nUDF convener N.D.

Sathiyan and Sutirtha).\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of sparring with left-handers in the camps, for both singles and mixed doubles, Sharath said, \u201cI plan to add Sanil Shetty to the proposed TTFI camp. Since in our country, we don\u2019t have left-handed women players of good playing strength, we [Sharath and Manika] will practise against male players.\u201d\n\nThe recently-elected Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of TTFI, Dhanraj Choudhary said Sonepat or Bangalore could be the venue of the preparatory camp.\n\n\u201cWe are looking only at air-conditioned facilities to hold the camp and a decision will be taken in the TTFI Executive Board meeting within a week,\u201d said Choudhary."},

It was a big pyre and the bodies were kept at a certain distance from each other,\u201d the official said.\n\nHe said since the viral infection was growing and more deaths were likely, they were planning to expand the makeshift facility and make it waterproof before the monsoon season. The official also said if people came forward to seek treatment at an early stage of the coronavirus infection, they could be saved.\n\nOn Tuesday, 716 cases were reported in Beed district, raising its tally to 28,491. The district has so far recorded 672 deaths, as per official data."}
