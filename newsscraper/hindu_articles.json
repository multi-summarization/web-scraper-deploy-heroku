In a contest packed with superstars was a 20-year-old sardar with a rebellious streak, aiming only to survive. Harbhajan Singh, a rookie off-spinner from Jalandhar, wasn\u2019t even sure at that point if cricket would be his career. He was not an obvious selection for the series. It was the backing of captain Sourav Ganguly and coach John Wright that got him into the squad. </p><p>What unfolded at the Eden is the stuff legends are made of. On the opening day, Singh claimed the first hat-trick by an Indian bowler in Test cricket. On the second day, he had his first five-wicket haul. On the final day he bowled India to a historic victory with a match haul of 13 wickets. His match figures: 13/196</p><p>For Singh, it was a career- and life-altering innings. It\u2019s remained his favourite performance; he says he has bowled better in other games without the same success. \u201cIt had to happen for me in that game. God chooses the moment,\u201d Singh says. Excerpts from an interview:</p><p><b>What do you think of when you think of the 2001 Eden Test?</b></p><p>I think about it as a game that changed my career, changed the vision of Indian cricket, (taught us, we) can win games from nowhere. Even when nothing is going in your favour, you hang in there and keep fighting and you can get unbelievable results. It gave us direction as a team, (showed us that) this is how we need to play. That we can beat the best side in the world; that we had the potential to beat anyone. </p><p><b>You were a rookie going into a match against the best team in the world\u2026</b></p><p>For me, every game was about survival. I was out of the India team and making a comeback. A lot of things happened to me before that. I was chucked out of the National Cricket Academy. Then I lost my father. I almost lost my place on the Punjab Ranji team as well. I was going through a very rough patch. I even thought about forgetting everything and doing something else in life. </p><p><b>Australia were off to a great start, scoring more than three an over\u2026 </b></p><p>Australia were batting as if they were playing a one-day match. Hayden was in great form. He had scored a brilliant hundred at Mumbai (the previous Test), which I felt gave him that direction on how to bat in India. He started playing those big sweep shots and slogs over midwicket. His frame was so imposing as a bowler, you wondered \u201cIsko beat kaise karein? (How do you beat his bat?)\u201d Hayden was taking the game away from us. He got out on the boundary line (caught off Singh\u2019s bowling), that too on 97. That kind of opened the door for us. Then I got Mark Waugh after tea. Everything was in our favour after that, I got the hat-trick and the game was equal at the end of the first day. </p><p><b>What can you tell us about the three deliveries that yielded the hat-trick?</b></p><p>I tried to keep it very simple. I wanted to make sure I was not giving away too many runs. I wanted to bowl wicket to wicket. It was a very nice wicket to bat on. The ball skidded on to Ricky Ponting (first wicket) and he was a bit late and got out LBW. Adam Gilchrist: I knew if I tossed up the first ball he would sit and sweep; that was his get-out-of-jail shot, so I wanted to pull my length back a little and bowl a little quicker to him. He went back and didn\u2019t have much time to react\u2014the ball hit his pads. </p><p>For Shane Warne, I just wanted to make sure the ball was finishing on the stumps and kept the length fuller. Lot of people used to play with pads, and if he deliberately pads, then I may have a chance to get him LBW, I thought. I had bowled exactly where I wanted to, and he played that flick shot. S Ramesh, for a change, was very alert and took an outstanding catch off a full-blooded shot. Everyone out there was celebrating and the way Rahul Dravid hugged Ramesh was as if it was his hat-trick. That\u2019s how it was, the kind of care we had for each other. As much as that hat-trick is mine, it is the team\u2019s hat-trick. </p><p><b>What were your teammates saying to you before that hat-trick? </b></p><p>There wasn\u2019t much advice, to be honest. They didn\u2019t want to confuse me. I only spoke to Dada (Sourav Ganguly). I asked, \u201cWhat I should do\u201d? He said: Just bowl the way you want to, I will set the field, you will have a lot of catching fielders; if it\u2019s meant to happen it will happen. </p><p><b>Do you still speak to Ramesh about that catch? </b></p><p>I keep meeting Ramesh on commentary stints and I tell him: thank you for being awake that day. Normally he was so laidback that if there was an award for laziness he would have got it. If you look at his batting style it was also like that, but quite effective. I always remind him, he is a lovely guy. </p><p><b>Australia fought back (from 291/8 to finish at 445) through Steve Waugh and Jason Gillespie\u2026</b></p><p>We fancied our chances of getting them early but knowing Steve Waugh, the kind of player he was, he would not give his wicket away, you had to earn it. He got a brilliant hundred with the tail and was the last one to get out. We didn\u2019t think we would collapse like that (171 all out) on a good wicket. Australians had the edge on us since they had the runs on the board (445) and Glenn McGrath was brilliant. We were outplayed in the first innings, but the second innings was very, very exciting for all of us. </p><p>VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid shared the best partnership I have ever seen in Test cricket. It was pure magic. </p><p><b>On the final day, at tea, Australia were comfortably placed at 163 for three. With Hayden and Steve Waugh batting, it didn\u2019t look like there would be a good result for India\u2026</b></p><p>We had created a few chances before tea. Hayden was dropped at mid-off. Something was happening on the wicket; we just wanted to put enough pressure on them. We had a lot of close-in fielders, we had the runs on the board, so we were not worried about going for runs. Our main job was to take those wickets. </p><p>I have seen that in Kolkata, the game moves really fast in the last session (post-tea). Wickets fall in that period. I have seen that in all the matches I have played there. After Steve Waugh got out, it opened the door for us, then Sachin (Tendulkar) came in to bowl and bowled that brilliant spell, taking three very important wickets. </p><p>It was a big opportunity for us to win the game from nowhere. It\u2019s the game that changed my career and I think that it changed cricket. Teams stopped giving follow-ons after that. </p><p><b>At the start of the match, there was so much pressure. What were you feeling at the end of it?</b></p><p>I was happy, satisfied and proud. I was part of a history-making team. We had given everyone a reason to smile. Before the series there was a lot of negativity after the match-fixing scandal. It had put people off watching the game. That was the series that brought confidence back for the people, got the crowd back into the game. </p><p>For me, it gave me self-belief: if I could take five wickets twice, that too against this Australian team, it meant I could play at this level. I was determined to make the most of things now. What I had done in this game, I told myself, I would continue even in the next game. In every game, I would try to repeat this performance. Which is not possible obviously, but I decided I would make the effort. </p><p><b>What do you remember doing after the win? </b></p><p>I used to call my mother every day. I spoke to her. I also remember receiving a letter from our prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2026 a fax to congratulate me. In the dressing room, we opened a bottle of champagne. We had a great time. We celebrated the way such a win is supposed to be celebrated.</p><p><b>And you took that confidence into the next game? </b></p><p>The whole series, we bowled good lines and good areas. By the third Test, we knew exactly what our plan was for each batsman, how we would execute it and what sorts of fields had to be set. When you\u2019re bowling in a great rhythm, all you need is to focus and you can make things happen. </p><p><b>It was an important game for Ganguly as captain too\u2026 </b></p><p>Honestly, I had no idea how important it was for Sourav. For me, it was about survival. If my performance helped Sourav\u2019s career or benefitted the team, great. The reason for which he backed me, it paid off. He had gone all the way to the selectors. Even though I had wickets in the Ranji Trophy to back my claim, I was not the preferred spinner. It was Sourav and John Wright who saw me bowling and they backed me. They said, \u201cHe is probably bowling the best in the lot and he should be playing.\u201d It paid off. God is watching. If you help someone needy, God will help you. That is exactly what happened. I was in need, and I got that support. Yes, I got the performance, but so many perform well and don\u2019t get a chance. I got the chance, and it worked. </p><p><b>What is the souvenir from the match that you have kept? </b></p><p>I have kept everything: the clothes I wore, the stump, the ball.</p>"},

An uncle who then painted film posters was visiting and asked me to paint a portrait of someone. We\u2019re a family of artists, so this was not unusual. He noticed, though, that I picked up black instead of brown for the skin. Later, when painting a coconut, I used green instead of brown, for the shell of a coconut.</p><p>A quick test showed that I have protan colour blindness, which is to say my greens and reds overlap with other colours. Red and brown look the same, as do yellow and green, and pink and grey. Only the shades differ. So, while other kids were learning their multiplication tables (which I was doing too), I was also memorising the colour schemes of the world around me. My parents would mark my colour pencils. </p><p>Funnily enough, it hasn\u2019t mattered to me that much, or to my art, that I don\u2019t see the way others do. The truth is, no one knows exactly how anyone else is visually experiencing the world. It\u2019s all a set of rules that we have collectively agreed upon. The fact that some of my rules are different hasn\u2019t stopped me from achieving what I want. </p><p>After I\u2019ve painted anything, I get friends or family to take a look at the colours. A portrait of my sister, for instance, had some grey on her head and neck. I then fix any colours that need fixing. </p><p>The people I am surrounded by, friends and family, encourage and motivate me. Through my work, they want me to show them how I see the world. They always tell me to put my vision into my art. But my goal is to paint in a way that you can\u2019t tell I am colour-blind. </p><p>When I first put on the EnChroma glasses that my friends had pooled in money for and purchased from the US, we were in a local playground, where we beatbox, breakdance and paint. The glasses were a surprise. Though they\u2019d taken me to an area where the walls were filled with my art, that isn\u2019t what I looked at first. I was staring at the grass. It\u2019s so green. I couldn\u2019t have imagined how green it was. </p><p>And then I saw pink. It had always looked like a shade of grey to me. Pink is this light, fluffy colour. I can\u2019t believe now all that I\u2019d been missing. Now I can see maroon, magenta, cyan, purple, violet. </p><p>The other day I was in a cab, stuck in traffic, and there was this fruit cart beside me. For the first time I noticed that black grapes are not black. I don\u2019t know what colour that is, but it was not black. </p><p>This is going to change my art. I have so many ideas and I am very excited for how it\u2019s all going to turn out. </p><p><i>(As told to Natasha Rego)</i></p>"},

Bernheimer, an environmental psychologist and author of The Shaping of Us: How Everyday Spaces Structure Our Lives, Behaviour, and Well-Being (2019), focuses in her work on creating spaces that are conducive to mental health. Think of how you might respond to the colour white. In the West, it is a symbol of celebration, and immediately sparks happiness. In many other cultures, an overwhelming wash of white can have the opposite effect, because it is associated with mourning. </p><p>At the level of city planning, such little missteps can have major impacts. Even a templatised grid of streets, the signature of a modern living, \u201cis very different from the way cities grew in history,\u201d Bernheimer says. There\u2019s a reason winding lanes and street corner pubs feel charming. The curves and local landmarks left over from the history of older towns feel more comfortable because they\u2019re more natural than the grids and strict order of a modern planned city. </p><p>Here then are three tips that might end up making you happier where you are. </p><p><b>A neat room for a healthier diet? </b>If you\u2019re trying to eat more healthily and / or lose weight, try cleaning your room, Bernheimer says. Studies suggest a link between order in the environment and good eating choices. In a messy space, you\u2019re more likely to make food choices that adversely impact your health. </p><p><b>If you\u2019re creating a work-from-home nook, focus on lighting first.</b> A good work area must have at least two sources of light. \u201cIt helps if we think about the cycle of the sun,\u201d Bernheimer says. \u201cIts light reaches us from multiple directions through the day.\u201d Designing a workspace such that it gets light from different directions at different times of day, preferably natural in the day and warm tones after dark, has been shown to have a calming effect and boost productivity, Bernheimer says. </p><p><b>Plants always help.</b> Anything natural will make your space more conducive to mental health \u2014 whether it\u2019s wooden flooring, a bowl of fruit or even a tiny rock garden.</p>"},

And some cities have it so much worse than others. If you\u2019re stuck in a traffic jam in Mumbai, Bengaluru or Delhi, you\u2019re on one of the world\u2019s Top 10 most-choked roads, according to the latest TomTom traffic index report. </p><p>The index has been providing insight on traffic congestion levels across 400 cities around the world for 10 years. It\u2019s powered by real-time traffic data and put together by the Amsterdam-based location technology provider TomTom International, which uses data from around 600 million connected devices to calculate, for example, how much extra time a driver will spend in traffic during rush hour in Mumbai.</p><p>Over the past four years, Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru have consistently featured on TomTom\u2019s top 10 most congested cities in the world for traffic. Mumbai, in fact, was at #1 in 2018 and has remained in the top five since. </p><p>The pandemic did temporarily ease the gridlock in 2020. Of the 400 cities surveyed, 387 experienced a significant decrease (average of 21%) in overall congestion. By contrast, only 13 cities saw their traffic jams increase. </p><p>But the top 5 remains familiar \u2014 Moscow returned to #1 after five years, with 54% congestion. Mumbai shares second place with Bogota and Manila, all seeing congestion levels of 53%. (This means a trip in any of these cities would take about 53% more time than it should.) Bengaluru is at #6 (51% congestion), New Delhi at #8 (47% congestion) down a bit from its last appearance at #4 in 2018. The other Indian city to feature is Pune, at #16, with 42% congestion. </p><p>The problem isn\u2019t new; the real problem is that the solutions aren\u2019t new either, planners say. </p><p>City planners turn blindly, again and again, to the same seemingly obvious solution: create more road space. But even with more road, infrastructure has been unable to keep pace with the growing number of cars. </p><p>India\u2019s road networks have grown by about 30% over the past decade, whereas vehicle registrations have risen by almost three times. In January 2019 alone, at least a million-and-half (1,607,315) vehicles were bought and registered across the country \u2014 an average of 51,000 new vehicles a day.</p><p>\u201cCongestion is only a symptom of a larger problem of misplaced priorities when it comes to urban planning and mobility,\u201d says Vaishali Singh, a senior associate on urban planning and design at the India arm of the US-based Institute for Transportation and Development Policy (ITDP), a global non-profit organisation. \u201c(Growth in) private vehicle ownership has surpassed the population growth rate in most cities. Yet cities continue to support them by creating urban highways and constructing more flyovers; instead cities should invest in high-quality public transport and walking and cycling infrastructure and incentivise people\u2019s shifts to these modes,\u201d Singh says.</p><p>As has been stated time and again, in text, numbers and viral animated graphics, a single bus, used to capacity, can take 30 to 40 cars off the street. A single Metro rake can take 20 to 30 buses off the roads (and move much faster, getting more people to their destinations in the same amount of time). Yet, buses get perhaps the least attention of any mode of public transport in India\u2019s cities.</p><p>As a result, bus ridership in India\u2019s metropolitan cities has declined by 20% over the last decade. Meanwhile, the traffic continues to take an economic, social and environmental toll. The average Mumbai resident wastes the equivalent of 8 days and 17 hours a year stuck in traffic jams. The average Delhi resident spends 7 days and 22 hours, according to TomTom\u2019s 2019 report.</p><p>Cities must focus on public transport more effectively, and simultaneously encourage a shift to non-motorised transport \u2014 walking and cycling \u2014 for short trips, making this safer and easier with wide comfortable footpaths and protected bicycle lanes, says Singh of ITDP India. \u201cAnd we must disincentivise the use of private vehicles by various methods including congestion pricing.\u201d </p><p>Until then, take a book, because the jams are likely to get worse before they get better.</p>"},

Done right, it can transport a visitor through time, as with the sound and light shows at the pyramids of Giza or the sprawling royal forts of Rajasthan. </p><p>When Puri\u2019s company, KSA, was approached to design the lighting for Mumbai\u2019s 142-year-old Rajabai clock tower and University library building, she knew it would be one of the firm\u2019s most high-profile and challenging projects yet. </p><p>Over two decades, KSA has designed the lighting for the 2,000-year-old Ajanta Caves in Aurangabad, a Unesco world heritage site; for Jawaharlal Nehru\u2019s one-time home, Teen Murti Bhavan, in Delhi; and for the Asiatic Library in Mumbai, among other heritage and commercial structures. </p><p>But the Rajabai tower is different \u2014 it\u2019s a heritage gem in the midst a bustling city, visible for miles away, its fa\u00e7ade an intricate collection of niches, arches and curves.</p><p>\u201cThe idea was not to light it up and make it into some sort of a Disneyland with all the colours under the sun,\u201d says Brinda Somaya, the conservation architect appointed for the entire restoration project. \u201cIt had to be an elegant show of architectural quality as it\u2019s a beacon for the city and all beacons have to be lit to tell a story. The architectural quality of the tower and the library had to show up.\u201d</p><p>So, in 2017, KSA was brought on. After an interruption to work caused by the pandemic, the lighting is nearly all done and the project will be complete by the end of the month. </p><p>With the clock tower, \u201cwe are going for a subtle revelation rather than a dramatic effect, with layers that range from the subtle to the celebratory,\u201d Puri says. \u201cThe gallery at the top of the first level is carefully sculpted with light. In these instances, the outside faces are kept relatively dark, creating a lantern effect. Above the first gallery are niches in which are stone figures representing the different races and costumes of western India. These sculptures have been backlit with a soft light, exposing the figures in silhouette. The play of light and shadow is very pronounced at this level.\u201d </p><p>The torso of the Tower is the dynamic piece of the jewel. The facade is replete with intricate detailing and the intricate nature of the lighting here attempts to celebrate that. </p><p>The slender columns are uplit. The arches are soaked in light. The galleries at various levels are illuminated in a dramatic style to set off the unique architecture, with its influences drawn from Victorian Gothic and Islamic styles. </p><p>Puri studied at the JJ school of architecture in Mumbai and then got a Masters in building sciences and lighting design from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. For inspiration, she looks to the work of the iconic Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, the man best known in India for designing the planned city of Chandigarh in the 1950s and \u201960s. </p><p>\u201cHis Notre-Dame du Haut chapel in Ronchamp, France, is one of the most inspirational spaces, chasing how light seeps into the space,\u201d Puri says. </p><p>The lighting of the Rajabai clock itself was an enormous challenge, Puri adds. \u201cThis is the obvious beacon one would look for.\u201d Seven mock-ups were created to verify the angles, intensity, colour rendering and fixture spacings. And so it stands now, bathed in a soft gold that gleams for miles, every detail seemingly illuminated.</p><p>\u201cOne way of identifying with your city is through its architecture,\u201d Somaya says. \u201cThe clock tower is a light of hope. There\u2019s some talk of opening it up for the public. I hope once the government sees its beauty after restoration and lighting, that will be the next step.\u201d</p>"},

There is no difference among us now.

That\u2019s why after lot of thought, I decided on not contesting,\u201d Dev told journalists adding that it\u2019s for the party to take a call on his resignation.</p><p>While Sarma and the BJP leadership were able to pacify Dev, they failed to stop former deputy speaker of assembly and sitting MLA from Silchar Dilip Kumar Paul, who resigned from the party on Wednesday for being denied a ticket, from filing nomination on Friday as an Independent candidate.</p><p>\u201cI have nothing against BJP\u2019s national leadership, but we all know what is happening with the party in Assam. I have decided to contest due to wishes of the voters in the area who want me to represent them again,\u201d said Paul.</p><p>BJP has given the Silchar ticket to Dipayan Chakraborty, a close associate of the party Silchar MP Rajdeep Roy. Paul had alleged that he was denied the ticket as he was opposed to corrupt practices of Roy and Chakraborty.</p><p>Another sitting BJP MLA, Sum Ronghang, who was a cabinet minister in the Sarbananda Sonowal cabinet, has already resigned from the party after denial of ticket.
