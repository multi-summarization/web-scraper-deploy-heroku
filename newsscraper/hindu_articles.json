R. Ambedkar on his 130th birth anniversary, the CJI said, \u201cToday morning, I was in a fix about which language should I deliver this speech. Today is the birth anniversary of Dr. Ambedkar which reminds me that the conflict between the language to be used while speaking and the language to be used during work is very old\u201d.\n\nHe said the Supreme Court gets many representations on what should be the language of subordinate courts, but I feel this subject is not being looked into.\n\n\u201cBut Dr. Ambedkar had anticipated this aspect and he had mooted a proposal saying that the official language of the Union of India should be Sanskrit,\u201d the CJI said.\n\nThe CJI said he cannot recall whether that proposal, which had signatures of some Maulvis, pandits, priests and Ambdekar, was tabled (in the Constituent Assembly).\n\n\u201cIt was Ambedkar\u2019s opinion that since Tamil is not acceptable in north India it might be opposed there and likewise Hindi will be opposed in south India. But, there is less possibility of opposition to Sanskrit in north India or south India and hence, he had mooted that proposal, but it did not succeed,\u201d CJI Bobde said.\n\nThe Chief Justice of India said Ambedkar possessed knowledge of not only about the law but he also knew social and political issues very well.\n\n\u201cHe knew what the people, the poor of the country wanted. He had full knowledge about all these aspects and I feel that is why he thought of putting up this proposal,\u201d the CJI said.\n\nHe said the law school is a nursery of the legal profession.\n\n\u201cLaw school is the nursery from which springs forth the harvest of our legal profession as well as judges. Dreams of many people have come true with the MNLU,\u201d the CJI said.\n\nHe further said the MNLU intended to \u201cimpart a national outlook to students and faculty who are drawn from all over the country\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no regionalism and no narrow-mindedness and this distinguishes a national law university from any other kind,\u201d he said.\n\nCJI Bobde said two unique courses are taught at the MNLU including a course that will produce judges much on the lines of the National Defence Academy (NDA) which not only produces soldiers but officers, and the other course is on \u2018Nyayshastra\u2019.\n\n\u201cThe Indian judicial system was inherited from the British which uses logic and the origin of logic is Aristotle.\n\nBut the \u2018Nyayshastra\u2019 which was developed in India is not the least bit inferior to Aristotle or the Persian system of logic.\n\n\u201cI see no reason why we should forsake, overlook and not benefit from the geniuses of our ancestors and that is how this course began which is unique,\u201d CJI Bobde said.\n\nThe CJI is set to retire on April 23.

But we are unable to meet the orders because of the frequent increase in prices of raw materials. We have represented this to the government several times. Now, we are looking at ways of joining hands with MSME associations across the State and across the country too, so that we can represent jointly,\u201d said an MSME unit owner here.\n\nC. Sivakumar, president of Coimbatore and Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs\u2019 Association, said the price of copper was \u20b9493 a kg in January-February last year and rose to \u20b9730 a couple of days ago. On Tuesday, it was \u20b9750 a kg. In the case of mild steel, it was \u20b949 a kg in January 2020, \u20b965 in April this year and \u20b967 on Tuesday.

Big companies are reducing job works to smaller units and are not agreeing to frequent revision in the prices they pay to the job working units. There are several micro and small units that buy raw materials from retail traders and do small components. They are unable to manage because the retail prices of raw materials are higher,\u201d he said.\n\nPrices used to go up in the past too. But it was neither so frequent nor so high. Many companies that imported small components from China are turning to Indian suppliers. So, there are enquiries across engineering sectors. But the MSMEs are unable to cater to the demand because of raw material prices. The government should intervene to stabilise the prices, Mr. Sivakumar said.\n\nAs many as seven industrial association heads met here on Monday and plan to have continuous meetings. They plan to join hands with industrial associations across the country and take up the issue at the national level to draw the attention of the government. It is not just price hikes, but also problems in raw material availability that are hitting the MSMEs hard.\n\nThe MSMEs have to bargain with multi-national companies and corporate companies to get a price revision for the components supplied. This situation has to be addressed and the government should take steps to control the prices, said another MSME unit owner here."},

Well before they morphed into Twobadour and Metakovan, their \u2018exosuits\u2019 as founder and steward of Metapurse, a crypto-based fund.\n\n(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click here to subscribe for free.)\n\nAnd before they realised that the Metaverse (an online convergence of virtual worlds and augmented reality) is a uniquely democratic playing field, on which they could make history, repeatedly.\n\nTheir most publicised triumph \u2014 so far \u2014 is the recent acquisition of Beeple\u2019s Everydays: The First 5000 Days, for a staggering $69,346,250 in a Christie\u2019s online only sale.\n\nThe news made headlines across the world for many firsts. This was the third highest price paid at an auction for work by a living artist. The work is an NFT, or non-fungible token, meaning it is a unique digital file on the blockchain. And, the 255-year-old auction house accepted payment in Ether, a cryptocurrency. (One Ether is roughly \u20b91,62,000.)\n\nMike Winkelmann aka Beeple posted a new work of art on May 1, 2007. He then did the same thing the next day, and the next, every single day for 13-and-a-half years. These individual pieces merged together create Everydays: The First 5000 Days.\n\nOf course, the sale was polarising. Even Beeple was startled at the high price: Bids jumped from $100 to $1 million in the first hour of the auction. There were 33 bidders from 11 countries, and 22 million visitors logged in for the final minutes at Christies.com.\n\nAnand Venkateswaran and Vignesh Sundaresan\n\nDid they pay too much? Is Beeple\u2019s grid of everyday art really that impactful? In an audio-only GoogleMeet interview immediately after the sale, Singapore-based Vignesh, then speaking via his Metakovan pseudonym said, \u201cI feel like I got a steal,\u201d to The New York Times. Anand agrees.\n\n\u201cDigital art takes the same amount of labour and talent as conventional paintings. The Christie\u2019s sale proved that digital art should be taken seriously,\u201d says Anand, who lives in Chennai. \u201cInstead of the whole process of making a pilgrimage to a museum to view it, you can see it anywhere. It\u2019s portable: you can carry it on your phone, or view on a laptop. There are now massive screens, where you can display the NFT directly on a wall\u2026\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cPeople keep saying, \u2018But I can\u2019t touch it.\u2019 Well, experience doesn\u2019t come from touch... Besides, this doesn\u2019t get corroded, it\u2019s resilient. And there is merit in that. There is a joy in owning something that will never age.\u201d\n\nWhose art is it anyway?\n\n\u2018Ownership\u2019 with NFTs is very different from a traditional oil on canvas. NFTs enable collectors and artists to verify authenticity of digital artworks by encrypting an unforgeable signature on the blockchain. Still, anyone can copy or download the $69 million Beeple \u2014 for free. Anand shrugs, \u201cYou can also make the Mona Lisa your screensaver. That is how art propagates itself.\u201d\n\nHe admits that, like for many of us, the concept was challenging to fully appreciate at first. \u201cFrankly, I was a little freaked out by it. That was the first step of unlearning for me. My notion of art is a square canvas with paint. The fact that that it could be programmable was overwhelming, for me. But that is why it is so relatable. You can communicate with it, even more than a physical piece \u2014 it talks back to you in vivid ways.\u201d\n\nHowever, it took a while for Anand to be fully convinced about diving into the world of blockchain. \u201cVignesh came on board as an app developer at The Hindu, and we worked together for a while,\u201d says Anand. \u201cHe discovered crypto in 2012, and that information was enough for him to fly to Canada to study, and start a crypto-based company.\u201d\n\nVignesh began looking for ways to earn Bitcoin, beginning with an exchange called Coins-e, which was sold in 2014. He then co-founded BitAccess, and went on to programme and install Bitcoin ATMs. He left BitAccess in 2016, to dive into Ethereum (the network on which ether operates), and now has multiple billion-dollar projects.\n\nRead More | Interview with Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum\n\nHe also runs Metapurse with Anand, which focusses on collecting NFTs in the virtual estate, art, unique collectables and more. \u201cI understood the words coming out of his mouth, but had no idea what they meant,\u201d chuckles Anand. \u201cSo, the same packet of information that made him a multi-millionaire did nothing for me.\u201d Then, Anand discovered the romance of NFTs.\n\nAdmitting that crypto can be intimidating for people who are not steeped in finance and technology, Anand says it actually enables creators to find imaginative ways to express themselves on a democratic playing field. \u201cOur Aha moment happened during the pandemic. The world has changed, and we were trying to figure out what the next big thing would be in the virtual space,\u201d he says.\n\nEthereum was mainly used for financial applications till in 2017, a blockchain game featuring digital cats, called CryptoKitties, got so popular it clogged the network. \u201cThis was a window into what the future would be\u2026 experience and fun,\u201d says Anand.\n\nRead More | What are CryptoKitties?\n\nThe market crashed, leading to two years of a \u2018crypto winter\u2019 in 2018 and 2019, after which the world of blockchain began to evolve in 2020, offering players a way to experience games and yes, art. Vignesh has been collecting NFTs since 2017, starting with virtual land, for which he paid $200,000. \u201cA pretty hefty price considering that all it was then was red dots on a screen, not yet an immersive experience. But that is what distinguishes him from regular investors \u2013 he sees around the corner. Realises the potential of an idea\u2026\u201d\n\nA digital rebellion\n\nDiscussing the allure of digital art, Anand says, \u201cThe tech behind it is what excites Vignesh. For me, it is the rebelliousness of these artists. Their ability to mix notions of conventional art and digital performance.\u201d\n\nQuestions remain on whether the Beeple buy was a marketing ploy: after all, it put Vignesh and Anand, as well as Metapurse, on the map. After a thoughtful pause Anand says, \u201cI don\u2019t think the numbers add up. You don\u2019t spend 69 million on marketing. And there is no product we are trying to sell here.\u201d He states they have no plans to \u201cflip it\u201d either, selling it for a higher price. \u201cThat would be extremely unimaginative.\u201d\n\nRead More | Indian crypto-currency exchange launches NFT marketplace for Indian artists\n\nStating that they are both \u201cmassive fans of Beeple,\u201d Anand says, \u201cThis art represents years of consistent work. He did on his good days, bad days, sick days\u2026 he did one piece in three minutes at 5 am, when his wife was in labour. You can see his growth as an artist,\u201d says Anand, adding \u201cthe commitment he showcased \u2013 mad respect for that.\u201d\n\nHe adds that he and Vignesh felt that work, which was also the first NFT to be sold by a mainstream auction house, belonged in Metapurse, even though they had no idea how much it would cost when the auction began.\n\n\u201cThe reason we were able to buy it is, Vignesh is not tied down to a certain lifestyle. He does not own a house, he does not own a car, and over 99% of his assets are in crypto. He lives from thesis to thesis with this space,\u201d says Anand, adding that they are working on a virtual monument now to display their big buy.\n\n\u201cNFTs have become a part of popular conversation because of this auction,\u201d says Anand. \u201cLet\u2019s face it, is this the best piece of art there is for 69 million? I have no idea \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter. We were in the right space, at this point in history to create this tiny moment. So we did.\u201d"},

The officer said the event was going on without any hindrance.\n\nHe said the crowds at the Ganga ghats were much smaller than expected at the third shahi snan \u2013 considered the most important in the series \u2013 and attributed this to the COVID-19 restrictions in place.\n\nPolice personnel were seen distributing masks among people in the Mela area. However, social-distancing norms were violated openly by the seers when they and their followers descended the steps at Har ki Pairi to wade into the river. No masks were worn by a large proportion of them.\n\nThe seers from the akhadas took the dip along with their revered deities carried in ornate palanquins at Har Ki Pairi, which was reserved exclusively for them.\n\nLakhs of common devotees bathed at the other ghats of the river in Haridwar and Rishikesh.\n\nSeers and Naga sanyasis of the Niranjani Akhada led by Acharya Kailashanand Giri were the first to bathe in the river along with Anand Akhada seers. They were followed by the Joona Akhada, which has the highest number of sadhus led by Swami Avadheshanand.\n\nThe Mahanirvani Akhada seers came next, as the batches followed one another according to their allotted time slots.\n\nAll akhadas have to finish taking a dip at Har Ki Pairi before sunset so time management is very important, Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal said.\n\nThe shahi snans, and the Kumbh Mela, have raised concerns over their role in possibly adding to rising coronavirus cases in the country. Uttarakhand recorded its highest single-day spike in COVID-19 cases on Tuesday with 1,925 people testing positive.\n\nDehradun with 775 cases and Haridwar with 594 were the biggest contributors to the day\u2019s tally.\n\nOn the initial hours of the third shahi snan, the DGP said there was no disorder anywhere. He said this was because of the expansion of infrastructure in Haridwar over the past few months, including the addition of more ghats which has helped in better crowd management."},

While the sharks (read: multiplexes) barely managed to surf through, it is the small fish (single-screens) that seemed to have suffered most of the onslaught.\n\nMovies you can count on\n\nSouth India\u2019s first cinema hall, Variety Hall as it was called, was constructed in Coimbatore in 1914. Now known as Delite Theatre, the single-screen theatre boasts of a legacy of witnessing several transitions in and outside of cinema.\n\nIt was among the earliest to introduce the concept of tentkotta (tent cinema), wherein a tent was erected for the audience to sit on the floor and watch. Benches and chairs were put up and were later replaced by sofas with a balcony, as there was an ever-burgeoning demand for cinema.\n\nThe theatre has seen films from the silent era, which were taken over by talkies; the conversion of film-reel projection to digital cinema, and has also survived the influx of multiplex cinema. Today, it serves as a remnant of the city\u2019s past with cinema, as it attempts to adapt by screening reruns of old movies.\n\nNot just Delite, but two other single-screen theatres in Coimbatore \u2014 Naaz Theatre and Shanmuga Theatre \u2014 have been screening yesteryear hits of Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan from their archives, to keep the business afloat.\n\nAccording to G Navamani, an employee at Delite Theatre, these films draw a crowd even today. \u201cWe cannot afford new movies as it is mandatory to run four shows, which is not feasible for us. Though we have Qube technology [digital projection] as well as the old projector, most new movies like Master are taken off from Qube\u2019s platform in a month\u2019s time after release. So, we resort to old movies which are screened using the projector,\u201d explains Navamani.\n\nThe responses for movies such as Nattamai (1994), Sakalakala Vallavan (1982) and Muthu (1995) have been heartening with an audience of over 100 people in a 600-seat capacity hall. \u201cReruns of Kamal Haasan\u2019s Kalaignan (1993) and Vijayakanth\u2019s Karimedu Karuvayan (1985) were big hits,\u201d she says, adding that tickets are priced at \u20b945 and \u20b990 for the two shows at 2 pm and 6pm.\n\nArtist V Jeevananthan, author of National Award-winning book Thiraiseelai on cinema, has watched Sholay, Enter the Dragon, Aradhana, and Yaadon Ki Baarat at Delite. \u201cI remember watching Sholay on the first day, 50th day, 100th day and 150th day. Shanmugha Theatre still shows MGR\u2019s Aayirathil Oruvan and Enga Veetu Pillai to a handful of 10 or 15 people.\u201d\n\nSome of the old players like Royal Theatres, one of the first in the city to introduce reruns with MGR films, prefer to wait and watch, and have closed operations for now.\n\nSurvival of the fortunate\n\nMounting debts and financial crunches forced some of the single-screen theatres to convert their properties or call it quits altogether. Like the 50-year-old Shanti Theatre at Narayanguda, Hyderabad, which raised a few eyebrows when it announced in November 2020 that it will shut down operations permanently, owing to losses. However, in mid-February 2021, the property reopened with the Telugu film Check, directed by Chandra Sekhar Yeleti.\n\n\u201cWe have 20 people working with us and indirectly, 50 families depend on the income generated from the theatre. We requested the owner to keep the theatre running, in the hope that things will limp back to normalcy,\u201d says N Balakrishna, the theatre manager.\n\nThe pandemic-induced lockdown forced Chennai\u2019s Casino Theatre, one of the iconic single-screens in the city which breathed a new lease of life in August 2019, to convert its space for parking when the lockdown restrictions were eased in July last year. The 80-year-old theatre was surviving as a hand-to-mouth business, until the situation moderately improved when Master released with 50% occupancy.\n\nWith newer restrictions in place, single-screen theatres are fighting a lonely battle for footfalls; some of them attribute this to the lack of star-backed films. \u201cThe noon show for the recently-released Wild Dog [starring Nagarjuna] had to be cancelled because there was no audience. The losses can only be recovered when we have a star\u2019s release,\u201d says the spokesperson for Casino.\n\nMaster, which many believe to be the biggest release till date, largely helped revive the business of Bengaluru\u2019s Mukunda theatre in Banaswadi. One of the oldest cinema halls in the city, the theatre has been predominantly screening Tamil films due to the large Tamil population in the area, since its opening in 1976. \u201cThe recent releases \u2014 Puneeth Rajkumar\u2019s Yuvarathnaa (Kannada) and Karthi\u2019s Sulthan (Tamil) \u2014 are doing well, too,\u201d says Bharani V, a representative.\n\nBut as COVID cases surge in Bengaluru, the Government has asked the theatres to roll back to 50% occupancy. \u201cJust as things were starting to look better, there is a new obstacle. There are a few big releases in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi lined up for April. But we are now back to a state of uncertainty,\u201d he says.\n\nThe alarming rise in the number of COVID cases in the second wave, is keeping families and audiences away from cinemas, believes RS Devdas, owner of Ajantha Theatre, Thiruvananthapuram. Only months before lockdown had Devdas spent nearly a crore to renovate the theatre, which has a rich history of playing classics such as The Sound of Music, Mackenna\u2019s Gold, Oliver Twist, Rathinirvedam and Chithram to mention a few.\n\nWhile there are whispers that suggest that the situation might improve by Onam for Malayalam cinema, there is palpable tension about another lockdown, \u201cIt is too early to comment about that and these are still early days to plan ahead. I can do three or four shows with two different films but I can\u2019t screen more than that,\u201d says Devdas.\n\nNow, with few films and fewer crowds, single screen theatres are finding ways to stay relevant in the business.\n\nWith inputs from Sangeetha Devi Dundoo, Jeshi K, Praveen Sudevan and Saraswathy Nagarajan"},

And cocktails with a Chennai soul\n\nSpaces is a unique Chennai luxury. Set beside popular Besant Nagar beach, the graceful venue, wild with flowers and vibrant with the scent of the sea, is a democratic breathing space for art, theatre and experimental performances.\n\nHow do you fuse a caf\u00e9 into a space that is so individualistic, and so fiercely loved?\n\n\u201cVery thoughtfully,\u201d says soft-spoken architect-hotelier-dancer Krithika Subrahmanian, who is perhaps the ideal person for the job with her ambitious vision for the space, supported by a meticulous attention to detail and personal history with the neighbourhood.\n\nAt the entrance to her just-launched venue, Synck, she explains how she grew up in the plot next door, \u201csitting on the balcony with my grandparents and a constant stream of visitors, listening to the music from performances at Spaces\u201d.\n\nNow, she has merged both properties, building a sprawling caf\u00e9, bar and restaurant besides the performance space, without altering its energy and setting. And, in the tradition of legendary dancer-choreographer Chandralekha who envisioned and created Spaces, Krithika hopes Synck will grow beside it, into a welcoming, creative community venue. \u201cI want to invite artists\u2026 I want guests to mingle, and have conversations,\u201d she says, adding, after a pause, \u201cOf course, some of that can only happen in a post-COVID world.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Synck has launched with an ambitious mandate. Comprising multiple ideas and moods that flow into each other, it includes a relaxed outdoor caf\u00e9 Svah, an intimate fine dining restaurant called Svasa and a soon-to-launch speakeasy bar, in addition to a compact theatre.\n\nAs Krithika walks through the caf\u00e9, pointing out the art it houses, traditional and digital, she explains why she chose to showcase progressive, vegetarian food in different formats across the property.\n\n\u201cWe want to focus on taste and nutrition,\u201d she says, adding that the team is building on its strengths, leaning on experience. (She also runs award-winning hotel Svatma in Thanjavur, set in a century-old building, popular for its luxurious vegetarian menus.)\n\nThe large alfresco caf\u00e9, an alluring refuge for pandemic-weary open space seekers, serves fairly adventurous \u201cglocal\u201d cuisine, in addition to caf\u00e9 classics, from Himalayan pink salt lattes to saffron affogatos. Advertised with contemporary Wellness\u2019 favourite buzzwords, the menu promises food that is \u201corganic, artisanal, progressive and inclusive\u201d.\n\nFortunately, along with the gimmicky frills (including dal served in dinky jugs), the cooking has a serious backbone.\n\nAt Svasa, dinner opens with creamy plantain stem soup, topped with crisp slices of airfried paintain tempura. The playful menu features stuffed brinjal served with Indianised arancini and enveloped in a rich velvety curry; a unique take on bisi bele bath served with a kodumpuli tart; and for dessert, a heady scoop of jasmine icecream.\n\nThe Awadhi mussalam stars bright, springy broccoli instead of meat, stuffed generously with nuts. It is laced with a clingy gravy, the flavours deepened with patiently toasted onions and garlic pods caramelised to a pleasing, earthy sweetness. While the kitchen brandishes a plethora of molecular gastronomy skills and showy plating, it is the old-fashioned sincerity with which they execute the food that will be Synck\u2019s strength: their careful sourcing, and respectful treatment of produce.\n\nThe highlight, however, will always be the unique proximity to Chandraleka\u2019s iconic open air theatre, and joy of soaking in strains of a concert in an eddy of sea breeze.\n\nSynck is at 42, 35th Street, Besant Nagar.

The trial is not designed to show if the vaccines are effective at preventing disease and the University of Oxford has said the intent of the study is to show that mixing is not substantially worse than not mixing.\n\nThe Com-Cov study remit reads: \u201cThe purpose of this trial is to see how well people\u2019s immune systems respond when their second \u2018boost\u2019 dose is a different type of vaccine to their first \u201cprime\u201d dose.\n\n\u201cWe will also be looking at how common vaccine reactions, such as fever, are after such \u2018mixed\u2019 schedules. This is important, as being able to use different vaccines in this way creates a more flexible immunisation programme; potentially allowing more people to be immunised more quickly.\u201d The researchers said they are enrolling people from all ethnicities and would particularly welcome participants from ethnic minority communities, considered among the higher-risk groups affected by COVID-19."},

A haloed Mother Mary \u2014 if she were a cyborg.\n\nCool blue metallic portraits might be the Guwahati-native artist\u2019s latest obsession, but the core idea still reflects his trademark affinity towards creating comic book characters out of people.\n\nWinner of the world\u2019s first Red Bull World Doodle Art Champion in 2014, Santanu has been steadily building a name for himself in the world of visual art. His art finds a place in the albums of musicians such as Raftaar, Ritviz and Divine; on sneakers by Adidas and Reebok; as graffiti on walls; and most recently, on a Rajasthan Royals tour bus, for this year\u2019s IPL season.\n\nOver the phone from Mumbai, where he is based out of now, Santanu explains how his fascination with comic books drew him to the world of art.\n\n\u201cI designed the artwork for Major Lazer and Nucleya\u2019s mix, \u2018Jadi Buti\u2019, in which these two characters: Bass Raja [drawn like an Indian king, an Amar Chitra Katha man with more defined abs] and DJ Lazer [a Jamaican hero shooting out lasers] are on a comic book cover,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are two wildly different characters from different universes, in a crossover scene.\u201d\n\nWithout any formal training in the subject, comics \u2014 from Spiderman and X-Men to Spawn and Dragon Ball Z, were his first inspiration.\n\nHeadbanging to art\n\n\u201cBack in school, I would draw sketches of these characters for friends, to earn canteen money,\u201d recalls Santanu. A quid pro quo, he would continue well into engineering college (this time, for pints of beer).\n\n\u201cIt was a bad phase for me. I really wanted to drop out, and take up graphic designing or animation, but I couldn\u2019t. I had to undergo therapy for my depression. I would sit in class and just sketch all the time, even the teachers had given up on me,\u201d he says.\n\nHowever, at the same time, word of his work spread and his musician friends in local bands from Guwahati and Shillong started requesting him to design their album art and equipment.\n\nRunning parallel to his interest in drawing, was his interest in metal music, and the two fed into each other. \u201cI loved listening to bands such as Iron Maiden, Megadeath, Cannibal Corpse,\u201d he says. But what he loved just as much was looking at their album art.\n\n\u201cMost of my artwork even now, is inspired by these old metal bands. They know how to give a face to their music. This idea of musical sounds lending to a visual representation is very interesting to me,\u201d he says.\n\nNot surprisingly then, Santanu\u2019s work has found favour in India\u2019s growing indie music market, where musicians and artists alike are trying to carve a space that\u2019s rebelliously un-Bollywood and yet Indian at heart. It shows in his work for Mc Altaf And Ikka of Gully Gang, and Seedhe Maut.\n\nGauhati Art Project Growing up in Guwahati, Assam, Santanu says he had a tough time finding mentors in the art and design world.\n\nIn 2018, he, along with three other artists and designers from the city, started the Gauhati Art Project as a way to give back to their home State of Assam.\n\n\u201cWe want to bridge the gap between young designers from the Northeast, and the outside world,\u201d he says.\n\nGAP holds talks with artists such as the Aravani Art Project, Sanitary Panels\u2019 Rachita Taneja, Green Humour\u2019s Rohan Chakravarty, and others.\n\nTo encourage originality, last year, it came up with an interesting theme for Inktober \u2014 the prompts were uniquely Assamese, from \u2018Lahe Lahe\u2019 (taking things nice and slow) to \u2018Dolar Bogori\u2019 (an unreliable person, who switches sides often).\n\n\u201cMy work is heavily inspired by our mythology, history and philosophy,\u201d he adds. \u201cI am interested in how mythology is a beautiful cryptic way of passing on knowledge, hidden in design. The more myths I read, the more I started incorporating those details and metaphors in my art,\u201d he says.\n\nDespite working on different mediums with a variety of clients, he believes that most of his artwork done commercially is not a representation of his original style, which he calls \u201cmuch vulgar, highly detailed, disturbing, and a touch macabre\u201d \u2014 a probable remnant of his metal roots.\n\n\u201cIn September this year, I will be doing my first solo exhibition in Bombay. It will have my personal works which I have so far been hiding from the world,\u201d he says."},

Loneliness, he has discovered, is a recurring theme in this year\u2019s NaPoWriMo.\n\nApril, being National Poetry Month, sees poetry communities and platforms hosting the NaPoWriMo challenge \u2014 of writing a poem a day. To get beginners started on this, hosting platforms put out prompts for each day.\n\nIt\u2019s a tradition that began in 2003 in the US, as a blog post, but is just as relevant this year, especially given the pandemic, believes Rohini Kejriwal, founder of Alipore Post. \u201cPoetry helps people open up and find their voice,\u201d says Rohini.\n\nA poetry enthusiast herself, Rohini started hosting NaPoWriMo last year, after COVID-19 hit. She observes the influence the past year has had on not just budding poets, but also the prompts she has been putting out.\n\n\u201cI wanted to provoke people to write about the words that have stayed with us in our lexicon, ones that we have encountered over and over: \u2018protest\u2019, \u2018vaccine\u2019, \u2018elegy\u2019, \u2018migration\u2019, and so on,\u201d says Rohini.\n\n\u201cWhile last year, I leaned more towards warmer prompts, that could help people free themselves from the situation they were in, this year, I think more seriousness has come through in the prompts. It reflects where I am, right now,\u201d she adds.\n\nRohini Kejriwal of The Alipore Post\n\nThe pandemic, she believes has influenced people\u2019s writing as they are spending more time reading and introspecting. Experiences of living without human contact or losing loved ones, or even losing two of the five human senses set off visceral reactions.\n\nPrompts are generally kept vague, so as to evoke different ideas in different people, based on their lived experiences. But with the pandemic putting a majority of the world through similar circumstances, the reactions to prompts too find common themes.\n\n\u201cThat feeling of being stuck is universal. For example, for the prompt \u2018Earth\u2019, in any other circumstance, you would expect lots of \u2018Nature\u2019 poems, but this year, there is imagery of the changes we need to be making to make it a better place. I also feel that last year, the collective fear and uncertainty was reflecting, whereas this year, a little more activism is coming through in people\u2019s words,\u201d says Rohini.\n\nSame prompt, different take\n\nOne of the 350 people who have responded to Rohini\u2019s prompts, Bahrain-based Kaav Ranj has been participating in NaPoWriMo for three years. \u201cI see things differently now because of how long we have been in this situation,\u201d says the 21-year-old spoken word poet.\n\nShe points to her two different poems she wrote, this year and last year, using the same prompt: \u2018Ode to My Throat Chakra\u2019. Where last year, it was about the \u2018rising up\u2019 of a voice, speaking of \u2018connection\u2019 and \u2018listening\u2019, this year the take was entirely different \u2014 one that reflected how drained she felt. \u201cI wrote about my throat being parched because of the constant need to talk. After the pandemic, content creators were in a way forced to engage more online, as there was a pressure to constantly put things out there.\u201d\n\nWhere to receive prompts Either log on to napowrimo.net, or follow these pages for a variety of prompts every day:\n\nPoetry Dialogue\n\nThe Alipore Post\n\nPoems India\n\nLet\u2019s Escape April\n\nHarnidh Kaur\n\nPoetry Plant Project\n\nFellow poet Vama Shah points out that it is natural that what we write will be influenced by our surroundings. Pandemic, she says, has made her write more about closeness, the need for human interactions and the importance of the little things in life. \u201cLast year, it was all about hope, for an end to the pandemic, but this year it is mostly about how we have shaped out lives around it,\u201d she says.\n\nNine days into April, Poem India had received over 1,500 submissions. Shivam too, notices a shift in the way people have been responding.\n\n\u201cOur first prompt was \u2018Every moment is a memory of a previous one\u2019. This prompt attracted a lot of submissions, where people talked about living in shells, anxious about their future,\u201d says Shivam.\n\nIn fact, he lists mental health, along with sexual abuse at home, and parenting, as the top themes in a pandemic world. \u201cEven with happier prompts, people are getting nostalgic, and reflecting on their lives pre-pandemic,\u201d he adds.\n\nReading poetry, says Shivam, helps us see that we are not alone. Rohini too, has been reading a lot of pandemic poetry. \u201cOne of the interesting pandemic projects I came across this year are the \u2018Dear Vaccine\u2019 poems,\u201d she says.\n\nDear Vaccine is a global community that invites people to promote COVID-19 vaccination through poetry. A collaboration between the Wick Poetry Center at Kent State University, and The University of Arizona Poetry Center, the project invites people to write using any of these four prompts: \u2018Dear Vaccine\u2019, \u2018We liked\u2019, \u2018It\u2019s the\u2026\u2019 or \u2018Vaccine please\u2019.\n\nAsk Rohini, what she would like to write and she says, \u201cDear Vaccine, please work your miracle on us all.\u201d"},

In Ambattur \u2014 widely regarded as the Detroit of India \u2014 his start-up Torus Robotics is set to change that, by making Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) for the Indian Army.\n\nAt the Aero India 2021 in Bengaluru, attended by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Torus Robotics signed an MOU with the Government, on the joint development of UGVs for the armed forces with BEML Limited.\n\n\u201cWith BEML, we are now developing a high-altitude Logistics UGV with 750 kilograms payload. It will be an all-terrain vehicle to supply to and from bases [without the need of human presence] in bad weather conditions, for the Northern Command,\u201d says Vibhakar.\n\nAt university in SRM, Kattankulathur, Chennai, Vibhakar, with his classmates, M Vignesh and K Abbhi Vignesh, spent time researching the robotics industry in India. A combination of patriotism \u2014 Vibhakar says he had hoped to join the Indian Army once \u2014 and passion for robotics, led them to focus on the defence sector.\n\n\u201cWe researched the issues our jawans faced during border patrol because of infiltration, heavy burden, high altitudes and lack of oxygen, and the corresponding mental health issues. We were wondering if robotics could solve that issue of logistics,\u201d says Vibhakar, adding, \u201cThe idea is not to replace jawans, but to aid them.\u201d\n\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh at the Aero India 2021 in Bengaluru, with Torus Robotics\n\nWhen Torus Robotics was officially established in 2019, it was with the help of someone who knew the in and out of the armed forces. Lieutenant General CA Krishnan (retired) mentored the three on the needs of the sector. \u201cHe was in the Army Design Bureau [that helps research organisations and start-ups, address the unique issues faced by front-line forces in the Indian Arm], and we will be officially incorporating him in the company in June,\u201d Vibhakar adds.\n\nWhy the focus on UGVs\n\nUGVs in the defence sector are mainly used for surveillance (border patrol), reconnaissance (scouting and collecting information), combat (like tanks, but smaller), and logistics (ferrying supplies from one base to another, where regular vehicles have trouble going) \u2014 the fourth is currently their highest priority. \u201cYou can also adapt UGVs for supplementary activities by making them amphibious or nocturnal and so on,\u201d says Vibhakar.\n\nIn July 2019, Torus Robotics finished its first project for Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), manufacturing and assembling a UGV. It has been put to use by the Indian Army, which had further tests and research done on it. The product is under a two-year warranty.\n\nWorking on all-terrain UGVs, they understood that whatever motors and controllers are needed in making them, are imported from China and other countries. This would be an issue if they wanted to manufacture more for the Indian Army, which is why they decided to fabricate their own.\n\n\u201cWe also won the Low Carbon innovation grant from the United Nations last year to develop solar-powered low-cost and high-efficiency motors (that use 30% of the energy required by regular induction motors), which could finance water supply in drought-hit areas,\u201d says Vibhakar.\n\nAfter their first project for DRDO, the trio had shifted base to Pune, as its manufacturing and supply was being done out of a factory in Turbhe. However, they soon moved back to Chennai \u2014 for the convenience of Ambattur.\n\n\u201cWe came back because we missed our great network with supply vendors in Chennai. Manufacturing electric vehicles is much easier in Chennai, here you can find products of defence grade quality at relatively cheap rates,\u201d he says.\n\nTorus is looking forward to setting up a small facility in Ambattur, where UGV research and the small-scale production of motors takes place alongside. \u201cThis is our comfort zone,\u201d he says."},

Beckford\u2019s great-grandson, the Duke of Hamilton, auctioned away much of this art in 1882. Such miniature paintings were appreciated in Europe in the 19th century, but more so in the inter-war period, when Beatty, the British Museum, Victoria and Albert Museum, and Calouste Gulbenkian were all building their collections.\u201d\n\nThe rocks of Deccan, around Hyderabad and Hampi for instance, became identifiers and were part of cultural consciousness, and hence artists, writers and poets who visited the region incorporated it into their work, Abeer points out. In Kalamkari \u2018Tree of Life\u2019 paintings, rocks became a fixture. \u201cLater, photographers of the 19th century, like Raja Deen Dayal, framed the rocks consciously in some of their images,\u201d he adds.\n\n(To register for the April 15 session, check Goethe Zentrum of Hyderabad\u2019s Facebook and Instagram pages, and to know more about Other Kohinoors documentary, look up www.otherkohinoors.com)"},

The CPTPP, the successor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) which the U.S. withdrew from, includes Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam from ASEAN along with Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru.\n\nIndia withdrew from the RCEP largely because of concerns it would open up India to Chinese goods, amid an already wide trade imbalance with China, and the failure of the agreement to adequately open up to services.\n\nMr. Balakrishnan said Singapore hoped India could help build a regional architecture that was \u201copen\u201d and \u201cinclusive\u201d.\n\nRising U.S.-China tensions, he said, were \u201cdeeply worrying\u201d for the region with the pandemic resulting in \u201cheightened tension\u201d which had \u201cimplications for us all\u201d, with a contest over emerging technologies, divergence on human rights, as well as tensions related to defence and cyber security issues.\n\n\u201cThe U.S.-China relationship is a lynchpin for regional and global stability,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Southeast Asia, it is all the more crucial to maintain ASEAN centrality and unity amid geopolitical competition\u201d.\n\nOn Myanmar, what ASEAN wanted was to stop the violence and then have direct dialogue between the military leadership and Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD). Sanctions, which the U.S. and EU have imposed, were \u201cthe worst thing we could do\u201d to \u201cadd the burden on to ordinary citizens\u201d to an already pandemic-hit country, he said. \u201cNot only ASEAN but immediate neighbours, like India and China, have strategic interests at stake and they can play a constructive role behind the scenes,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Singapore Foreign Minister praised India\u2019s strong support to global vaccine cooperation, at a time when the pandemic had \u201cturbocharged protectionism and nationalism all over the world, significantly disrupted trade flows and supply chains, and sharpened the tendency for policymakers to turn inwards\u201d.\n\nEfforts were on by Singapore, he said, for mutual recognition of health certificates with other countries, with interoperability across borders to gradually facilitate a resumption of travel."},

In both configurations the second-row seats feature a one-touch tumble mechanism and get a sliding function. Speaking of the third row, the seats get a reclining function and they also fold down flat to provide better boot space.\n\nThe interior also gets a dual-tone colour scheme and the captain's seats version gets a unique floor-mounted central armrest with cupholders and extra storage space.\n\nUnder the hood, the Alcazar will be available in both petrol and diesel engine options. The petrol unit is an updated version of the 2.0-litre, four-cylinder engine in the Elantra and Tucson, that now produces 159hp and 192Nm. The diesel engine on the other hand, is the same 1.5-litre, four-cylinder turbocharged unit from the Creta that produces 115hp and 250Nm.

It has been years since I gave up on television, but was forced to reconsider my decision when literally all the people I knew and value the most were talking about this show. I felt left out and succumbed to peer pressure, to watch one episode in January. I watched a lot more and since then, I have become a bonafide Cook... fan.\n\nAlso Read | Get \u2018First Day First Show\u2019, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here\n\nThe pandemic has been hard on all of us and we all have our own battles to be fought and hopefully emerge triumphant. Sometimes the frustration comes from the outside and sometimes, you never know from where it comes. And I personally have been going through a lot of mood swings since the beginning of the year, and discovering Cook with Comali, a show where reasonably good cooks are pitted against each other along with their amateur partners (comali), during this phase has got to be one of the best things that could have happened.\n\nBaba Bhaskar and Sivaangi\n\nFor those two hours on weekends, I just let my guard down and realised the calming effect good comedy has on you. Though a reality show, Cook with Comali, for the most of us, became the equivalent of the breathing exercise yoga instructors would advise you to follow \u2014 none of this would have made sense without the remarkable contribution of the show\u2019s editor and their timely Vadivelu-Tamil cinema references and song selections.\n\nWhile it might appear that popular comedians Pugazh and Bala were the main driving forces behind the show, it would be blasphemous to overlook the contribution of fellow comalis, cooks, judges, the anchor, and the rest involved. Whenever the editor cut to a melodramatic song to show the Pugazh-Shivaangi bromance or Ashwin-Shivaangi romance, or each time Bala came up with a punchline only he could think of, I laughed. I screamed each time Tiger Thangadurai (I\u2019m a massive fan) made an appearance to deliver his bag of 32 jokes. Actually, strike off that last sentence: I laughed harder each time Thangadurai tried to make a joke.\n\nThe show has turned out to be a massive stress-buster during the pandemic for TV audiences\n\nAs was the case with Madurai Muthu, whose gags could be both therapeutic and sometimes make you consider going to therapy. I laughed more looking at Kani\u2019s apologetic face whenever there was a kara kuzhambu joke \u2014 something even AR Rahman couldn\u2019t resist from poking fun at (in the promos for the finale). Not to mention the supremely energetic yet beautifully-animated Baba Bhaskar. I enjoyed Venkatesh Bhat\u2019s pan-flip and the deadpan humour from other comalis.\n\nSometimes, cringe and boring have been few of the adjectives slapped against Vijay TV for reinforcing popular Kollywood stereotypes in television. There have been times when the channel was accused of their distasteful jokes and hot takes. But Cook with Comali is as much a turnover for the channel as it is for Shakeela, one of the contestants on the show, who has long been carrying the cross as a soft-porn actor. The showrunners have shown commendable sensitivity in the way they approached and acknowledged the presence of Shakeela, in their larger goal to make her feel warm and inclusive. The credit should be shared by fellow comalis for ensuring that their jokes were never below the belt, and it has never been that.\n\nShakeela has been one of the most popular contestants on the show this season\n\nDirector Parthiban and the showrunners too, on their part, have displayed admirable quality when it comes to correcting the wrongs, when a situation goes out of control. Like when a homophobic joke was edited out ahead of the show\u2019s airing, when people who caught it online, pointed it out on social media.\n\nAs we draw curtains to the second season of Cook with Comali, it is back to square one for fans of the show. We don\u2019t know where to go, to bury our sorrows and let go. For the newer loyalists like me, it is going to be hard to imagine a weekend without logging on to Disney+Hotstar... there is a hollow deep down. I wish I could say: \u201cChumma prank pannen... camera paarunga.\u201d"},

Of the remaining 400 million, 150 million live in Europe and Latin America/Caribbean, with the rest in North America and Oceania. On a global scale, higher education service providers should pay close attention in researching the skill-set gaps in the young generation of learners, specially in emerging markets.\n\nThe recent phenomenon of the technology revolution and automation has changed the professional service landscape in emerging markets, especially in South Asian, African, and Latin American countries. The burgeoning growth of MNCs have drastically increased the demand for skills, and there is not enough skilled talent to meet the ever-growing needs of companies in emerging markets. According to the World Economic Forum, less than five years from now, 85 million jobs will be taken over by machines. Technological advances in robotics and machine learning will also create 97 million new job roles and change the demand of skills sets that employers need from human workers.\n\nWhich skill-sets and job roles must knowledge economy professionals in emerging markets develop in an AI-enabled world?\n\nUpskill and reskill\n\nToday\u2019s learners of knowledge economy are expected to master 21st century skills that are instrumental to solve complex, real-world problems that are non-standard, full of ambiguities, and have more than one right answer. The learners are required to upskill/reskill themselves and master analytical thinking and innovation skills, active learning, resilience and flexibility, emotional intelligence, creativity, leadership, and so on to remain relevant and in demand. Such an expectation demands that educational service providers innovate their offerings to offer personalised, yet cost-effective, experiential learning opportunities. The learners must pursue multidisciplinary Nano professional courses that rely on specialised training to solve specific, often unique, problems in fields such as architecture, engineering, management, law, medicine, and other disciplines.\n\nBridge the skill-set gaps\n\nThere are three aspects to fill the gap that exists. The first is \u201cVital for few\u201d (highly skilled and strategic competent workforce) to identify jobs that require \u201chighly variable and creative processes\u201d. The demand for this is high and supply is less, so this segment commands high salaries. The consequence is that the prices of customised programmes/courses continue to soar. Market forces have spurred the development of cognitive technological applications that enhance the work of the professional learners. Digital technologies have augmented creative capabilities by leveraging machine-learning, predictive analytics, and data-mining capabilities with AI in highly specialised areas such as FinTech, Blockchain Technology, Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, Encryption and cybersecurity, among others. High variability in client inputs cascades throughout the process because unique problems call for customised solutions.\n\nThe second aspect is \u201cVital for many\u201d (entire workforce) to identify the jobs that require less variable standardised processes that can more efficiently and effectively serve a broader client base. The demand for this is also high and supply is increasing with the opportunities to gain digital skills and other competencies through free access to online programmes. These approaches have led to less variable standardised skill sets in the market, and these services can be performed more economically with the help of technology leading to an efficient delivery to target customers. The in-demand jobs in this case will be computer systems troubleshooters and maintainers, digital marketing executives, customer service representatives, transport technology technicians, among others.\n\nThe third aspect that has a huge demand in emerging markets is a combination of the above skill-sets. Companies need employees who can multi-task effectively and are able to move smoothly from one activity to another. For this, the employee must be able to prioritise tasks and address the most critical and pressing demands (objectives and key result areas or OKRAs). In most emerging markets, there is a polychronic culture in which employers prefer employees who can engage in two or more tasks or events simultaneously, and believe that their preference is the correct way to do things. This can be achieved by pairing people and technology together in a collaborative way (known as COBOTICS). This can be achieved by using the \u2018workforce analytics systems\u2019.\n\nThe knowledge economy suggests that human skills along with technological resources will be the best combination to create a dynamic inclusive, sustainable, and resilient work environment that will demand massive investment in education and training in upskilling/reskilling of people for lifelong learning capabilities, and partnership with employers to narrow the gap between demand for skills and the workplace.\n\nThe views expressed are personal.\n\nProf. Balvinder Shukla is Professor of Entrepreneurship, Leadership and IT and Vice-Chancellor of Amity University Uttar Pradesh, Noida, India.

That was replaced by the first-gen S5 Sportback with the second-gen model arriving on our shores in 2017. Now the S5 Sportback is back in its facelifted guise. So what is it like?\n\nIt is amazing how a few small, relatively inexpensive additions to the exterior have transformed the visual character of the S5 Sportback.\n\nThis Turbo Blue paint shade is certainly a big contributor, but what also helps are the new LED headlamps and tail-lamps, the pointier bumpers with swollen brushed silver accents, and a grille that is now accented with silver \u2018studs\u2019 rather than traditional horizontal slats. Furthering this sporty cause are the aggressive five-spoke, 19-inch alloys which fill out the wheel arches nicely, and the S models\u2019 trademark silver wing mirrors and quad tailpipes.\n\nMoreover, since this is a CBU import, the ride height has not been raised for India, and what you get is a nice wide stance with enough ground clearance for our roads.\n\nFlush with features\n\nMoving to the cabin, the biggest change is to the infotainment display \u2014 a large free-standing 10.1-inch display with a touchscreen interface. Though overall dash design is still shared with the A4, there is no denying its clean sophistication. Another highlight of the S5 is the upholstery with a mix of leather and Alcantara adding to the \u2018S\u2019 ambience.\n\nQuality, ever an Audi highlight, is near impossible to fault. There is, as before, a flat-bottom \u2018S\u2019 steering wheel and Audi Virtual Cockpit digital dials, but this screen-based instrumentation is of the new generation and much crisper looking.\n\nOn the features front, you are well covered and there is also an optional kit available that provides a heads-up display, a Bang & Olufsen sound system and a parking assistant.\n\nRuthless efficiency\n\nThe one thing that has not changed at all is the powertrain. The 354hp, 3.0-litre turbocharged V6 and eight-speed torque-converter automatic are well met, and there isQuattro AWD with a 40:60 front-to-rear split for the 500Nm of torque. In Dynamic mode, the S5 deploys its performance with a ruthless efficiency we expect from sporty Audis. While there is no launch control, it shoots off the line ferociously enough to achieve the claimed 4.8sec 0-100kph time.\n\nIt roars through its rev band with your right foot pressed down. What is interesting is that though the shifts are quick, they are not the aggressive headbutts you get in an RS5, which makes sense in this car. However, the S5 also shines when you knock it down to Comfort mode; it is refined, smooth and very easy to pilot. It even rides surprisingly well; the base suspension is just that comfy, although you might hear a thud in protest from those 19-inch wheels if you hit a bump too fast.\n\nHandling is classic Audi, with the Quattro system giving it an unflinching grip on the road no matter how hard you push around corners. There is quite a lot of understeer too, but this is understandable in something that is not a full-on sportscar. The steering is quick enough to elicit agile direction changes.\n\nThe S5 is accessible, even for first-time performance car buyers. And when you are not tearing up the tarmac, it is a serene luxury experience.\n\nThe CBU imported S5\u2019s price of \u20b979.06 lakh (ex-showroom) is not easy to overlook. But it packs in plenty of performance and errs more on the side of usability. Perhaps its biggest standout quality is its stunning looks, and because it does not have a lesser counterpart in the range, it won\u2019t be mistaken for anything else."},

Or how Maharajkumar Bhupal Singh of Mewar, who was paralysed from the waist down, had a special hand-controlled Rolls Royce he could use by himself as far back as 1923.\n\nEven as they kept up with the British, Indian rajas and members of the princely families, took to modifying the basic structure of the car to suit their personal tastes. Often bordering on the ostentatious or simply garish \u2014 zenana cars, hunting vehicles complete with a sunroof as a turret and others cutomised with cocktail cabinets and detachable spittons \u2014 were just a few of the many specimens they flaunted.\n\nCollector items\n\nIt was not long before wealthy professionals of the day began to acquire cars, and it is partly due to their efforts and passion that many vintage cars disposed off by royalty found second homes. Many rare cars such as the 1939 Delahaye 135MS, Rolls Royce Phantom II Continental, SS100 Jaguar, Lancia Astura and the likes, have been restored and housed by many across the country with a penchant for four-wheeled beauties.\n\nWhile many of these vehicles are part private collections, some collectors have opened museums, giving laymen the opportunity to view these marvels \u2014 the Vintage Car Museum in Ahmedabad, the Heritage Transport Museum in Haryana and the Gedee Car Museum in Coimbatore are prime examples.\n\nScreen presence\n\nAs passionate as he is about vehicles, Gautam says the portion of the book he most enjoyed penning was the part where he explores the role of automobiles in art, literature and cinema.\n\nHe recounts watching the Hindi movie Apradh as a child, back in 1972. Starring Feroz Khan and Mumtaz, the film began with its opening credits rolling over a racing sequence. \u201cThat was really disappointing, but I would wait for another amazing car race that would conclude by the 57th minute of the movie and then leave the theatre,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is extraordinary is that the racing sequence was shot with actual rally racers of the day. I was able to trace Rene Herzog, one of the racers from that movie, and talked to him at length.\u201d\n\nHerzog, now 73, was a professional rallyist who raced with legends such as Niki Lauda. He remembers the Indian movie sequence shot at the N\u00fcrburgring F1 track in Germany, and being captivated by the beautiful Mumtaz.\n\nGautam includes anecdotes from other members of the film fraternity passionate about their cars. From yesteryear movie stars such as Salim Khan and Raj Kapoor, to actors Mehmood and Jackie Shroff, a dazzling range of historic vehicles have been (and still are) in their possession.\n\nAn Indian love story\n\nWith his brand of barbed humour, Gautam has not shirked from calling a spade a spade, while recounting the debacles of the colonial rulers of our past or the despotic \u2018desi\u2019 ones post-Independence. From Sanjay Gandhi\u2019s botched handling of the Maruti project and the all-encompassing miasma of red tape in India, to the unprecedented success of the Nano abroad and India\u2019s infamous track record with hosting international rallying events, Gautam tells it as it is.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that whatever I have said has been supported by documented evidence. These are hard facts, and I have been as balanced and objective as possible, he says, adding, \u201cOne needs to have opinions; you need to be able to say that look, this is where we went wrong and where things didn\u2019t go right,\u201d says Gautam.\n\nThe once-ubiquitous Ambassador, Fiats, Mahindra jeeps and Premier Padminis all find a place in The Automobile. And since it is a book on the history of vehicles in India, there is also a chapter on bikes and the fascination they hold for many Indian women \u2014 not just docile two wheelers but assertive, aggressive motorcycles.\n\n\u2018The Automobile\u2019 is available in bookstores and online"},

Bringing them together is veteran film producer Dr. Jayantilal Gada of Pen Studios.\n\nThe yet-untitled project has been announced around the auspicious time of Baisakhi in North India and Puthandu in Tamil Nadu, which marks the New Year celebrations in these respective calendars. The film is slated to go on the floors in mid-2022, and will be co-produced by God Bless Entertainment.

You can subscribe for free here\n\nTalking about the remake, director Shankar said, \u201cFor it to be made into a Hindi film, Anniyan needed a maverick, charismatic showman like no other to play the part. I found this in the mercurial Ranveer Singh, because he is a one-in-a-generation actor who has shown us that he can immortalise a character through his stellar performance.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to make Anniyan for the pan-Indian audience and I\u2019m confident that this powerful story will strike a chord in the hearts of all. In Dr. Gada, Ranveer and I have found an ideal producer who believes in the vision we have to change the nativity of content for audiences across the country.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Ranveer Singh said in a statement, \u201cI am blessed to have this opportunity to be a part of the spectacular cinematic vision of Shankar sir. He is an exception to the norm, a true disruptor who has shown us that no vision is large enough to achieve on screen. I had always hoped and dreamed that I would get a chance to collaborate with him, and I have a strong feeling that we will create magic together. To lead a film like Anniyan is a dream come true for any artiste.\u201d\n\nThe actor was also full of praise for Vikram, who acted in the original, \u201cVikram sir, one of our country\u2019s finest talents, an artiste who I hugely admire, gave a colossal performance in the original, one that can never be matched. I can only hope that my interpretation and rendition of the part also connects with audiences in the same way. It\u2019s undoubtedly a once-in-a-lifetime performance piece, and I am ready to give this role every single ounce of my being. Shankar Sir is a genius filmmaker and a true visionary. Words don\u2019t do justice to just how excited I am at the prospect of being directed by him.\u201d\n\nThe original Anniyan, released in 2005, followed the life of an average everyday man, who is frustrated at the government and system, and takes things into his own hands to correct it. The main protagonist, played by Vikram, develops multiple personality disorder and revels in two other identities to combat his disillusionment. The film, that also starred the likes of Sadha and Prakash Raj, and had music by Harris Jayaraj, was a massive success and even won a National Award for Special Effects.\n\nThe film was also dubbed into Telugu as Aparichithudu and in Hindi as Aparichit, that was released a year later.\n\nApart from Anniyan, director Shankar is known for his big-budget blockbusters over the years, including Rajinikanth\u2019s Enthiran, Sivaji and 2.0, as well as Kamal Haasan\u2019s Indian.

Click here to subscribe for free.)\n\nTo understand President Joe Biden's challenge in taming a semiconductor shortage bedeviling automakers and other industries, consider a chip supplied by a U.S. firm for Hyundai Motor Co's new electric vehicle, the IONIQ 5.\n\nProduction of the chip, a camera image sensor designed by OnSemiconductor, begins at a factory in Italy, where raw silicon wafers are imprinted with complex circuitry.\n\nThe wafers are then sent first to Taiwan for packaging and testing, then to Singapore for storage, then on to China for assembly into a camera unit, and finally to a Hyundai component supplier in Korea before reaching Hyundai's auto factories.\n\nAlso Read | Taiwan to discuss supply chains with U.S. next week amid auto shortage\n\nA shortage of that image sensor has led to the idling of Hyundai Motor's plant in South Korea, making it the latest automaker to suffer from global supply woes that crippled production at most automakers including General Motors Co and Ford Motors Co and Volkswagen.\n\nAnd the winding journey of the image sensor shows just how complicated it will be for the chip industry to both ramp up capacity to address the current shortage and re-invigorate U.S. chip manufacturing.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden on Monday convened semiconductor industry executives in Washington to discuss solutions to the chip crisis, the latest move in a broader effort to bolster the domestic chip industry. He's also proposed $50 billion to support chip manufacturing and research as part of his $2 trillion infrastructure proposal, which he said would help the United States win the global competition with China.\n\nMuch of that money will likely go towards the construction of multi-billion-dollar advanced chip plants by Intel, Samsung and TSMC. But industry executives say addressing the broader supply chain is crucial, and the Biden administration faces complicated choices on which elements of it to subsidize.\n\nAlso Read | White House working to address semiconductor shortage hitting auto production\n\n\u201cTrying to reconstruct an entire supply chain from upstream to downstream in a single given location just isn\u2019t a possibility,\" David Somo, senior vice president at ON Semiconductor, told Reuters. \"It would be prohibitively expensive.\"\n\nThe United States now only accounts for about 12% of worldwide semiconductor manufacturing capacity, down from 37% in 1990. More than 80% of global chip production now happens in Asia, according to industry data.\n\n1,000 STEPS, 70 BORDERS\n\nProducing a single computer chip can involve more than 1,000 steps, 70 separate border crossings and a host of specialized companies, most of them in Asia and largely unknown to thepublic.\n\nThe process starts with plate-size discs of raw silicon. At chip factories known as 'fabs,' circuits are etched into the silicon and built up on its surface through a series of complicated chemical processes.\n\nThe next step - packaging - offers a good illustration of the supply chain challenges.\n\nWafers emerge from fabs with hundreds or even thousands of fingernail-sized chips on each disc. They must be cut up into individual chips and put into a package.\n\nTraditionally that meant placing each chip onto a \u201clead frame\u201d and soldering it to a circuit board. The entire assembly would then be packaged in a resin case to protect it.\n\nThat process is very labor intensive, leading chip companies to outsource it decades ago to countries including Taiwan,Malaysia, the Philippines and China.\n\nThe packaging step itself has its own supply chain: South Korea's Haesung DS, for example, makes packaging components for automotive chips, exporting them to Malaysia or Thailand for customers including Infineon and NXP. These companies, or in some cases a sub-contractor, then assemble and package chips for automotive suppliers like Bosch and Continental, which in turn supply final products to automakers.\n\n\u201cIf they (the Biden administration) are going to be successful with this, they are going to have to help rebuild the package industry here in the United States,\" said Dick Otte, CEO of Promex, a California-based chip packaging firm.\n\n\"Otherwise it is a waste of time. It is like building a car and not having a body to put on it.\"\n\nBut newer chip packaging processes are far less labor intensive, leading some U.S. chip makers to believe they can be brought back from abroad.\n\nIn October, Minnesota-based chip foundry,SkyWater Technology took over a facility in Florida where it plans to build out advanced packaging lines.\n\n\u201cThere's kind of an industry-wide agreement that all this needs to happen here,\u201d Thomas Sonderman, chief executive, SkyWater Technology, said.\n\nFASTER TURNAROUND\n\nRebuilding the U.S. packaging industry would not only insulate chip companies and their customers from political risk,it could also help them break free of the long cycles involved in creating new chips, said Tony Levi, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of SouthernCalifornia.\n\nBy doing more work locally, U.S. chip firms could creates maller manufacturing runs of chips more frequently, speeding innovation and potentially creating the capability to more quickly adjust to demand.\n\nLevi said that Arizona, Texas and New York \u2013 where Intel, TSMC, Samsung and Global Foundries all have existing or planned facilities \u2013 would be suited to cluster supply chain elements like packaging.\n\n\u201cWhat the U.S. is very good at is close collaboration between system design, product design and the manufacturing itself,\u201d Levi said.\n\nStill, it remains to be seen how the Biden Administration will balance the demands of the many sub-sectors of the chipindustry.\n\nNumerous firms, many of them overseas, provide critical foundry materials including wafers and gases. The sophisticated tools used for advanced chip production are mostly made in the United States, but that's not the case for factory components such as the robotic systems that whisk chips among the various process steps.\n\nOn top of that, some in the industry argue that the U.S. needs to support not only new cutting-edge fabs, but older technology too. It's the more mature chips that are in severe shortage, noted Tyson Tuttle, CEO of Austin-based silicon design firm, Silicon Labs.\n\n\"We have a mismatch of capital in the semiconductor industry,\" he said, with too much of the money going to the most advanced technologies.\n\nE. Jan Vardaman, President at Tech Search International Inc,said the chip packaging industry has been under severe price pressure, leading to smaller margins than chip factories and chip design firms. \"From a financial and economics point of view, it does not make sense for them to make a big investment.\"\n\n\"Simply throwing money at this does not solve the problem. It is a more complex problem.\""},

With this update, KTM has brought the 390\u2019s styling to the 125. However, this revision for the 125 is not purely cosmetic.\n\nIts sharp tank extensions and rear end contribute to the aggressive stance. While the 125 Duke misses out on the split-LED headlight found on higher-capacity Dukes, the halogen unit is in a similar shape. Another change this update brings is a new fuel tank that is styled to work with the more aggressive design.\n\nAs with body panels, the tank is also shared with the higher-capacity Dukes, which means it can now hold 2.5 litres of additional fuel (13.5 litres). Another big change the new 125 Duke gets is the updated trellis frame that features a bolt-on subframe. This allows for only part of the subframe to be replaced if it gets damaged in an accident, significantly lowering repair costs.\n\nThe updated subframe also allows for a more spacious seating setup than before. This is the same setup as the higher-capacity Dukes, and it is proven to be noticeably more comfortable. While there are a lot more similarities to the 390 Duke, the 125 variant misses out on adjustable levers and bar-end weights. Like the 200 and 250, the 125 also carries forward the LCD dash.\n\nWhat also remains the same as before are the power and torque numbers. It meets the stricter emission standards while putting out 14.5hp and 12Nm of torque. This might make it the most powerful 125cc bike on sale in the country, but it is also the heaviest. At 159kg, it weighs a substantial 11kg more than the previous-gen model, reducing the power-to-weight ratio from 97.9hp/ tonne to 91.2hp/tonne.\n\nRide to the limit\n\nThat has an effect on the performance and \u2014 with a 0-100kph time of 21.3sec \u2014 the new 125\u2019s acceleration is noticeably slower than the bike it replaces. Despite this, it still feels decently peppy and fun in the city and it is only when the roads open up that you notice the deficit. The bike energetically revs through each of its six gears, but the speedo climbs significantly slower than the tacho. The little engine on this Duke has to be worked hard and there are times it will refuse to build speed without a downshift or two.\n\nAs a result, carrying momentum is vital and, luckily, that is something this chassis is more than qualified to do. The 125 Duke also gets the 43mm USD fork and monoshock, 150-section rear tyre, and a 300mm disc brake up front. What this means is that you can literally ride the 125 Duke to its limit with absolutely no stress.\n\nLike the other Dukes, the suspension is quite firm but not uncomfortable and it offers impressive feedback. The wide MRFs are more than adequate on this motorcycle and are nothing but confidence inspiring. There is more than enough braking power on tap, and you do get single-channel ABS, but at this price you would expect a dual-channel system.\n\nTo conclude, it looks much better and is slightly better equipped, but it is also significantly heavier and more expensive. At \u20b91.50 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), it costs around \u20b98,000 more than the previous-gen model \u2014 a hike that is justified given the major changes and switch to BS6.\n\nHowever, it is not always value that buyers are after; for someone who simply wants to own a KTM, the 125 remains a good choice."},

Officials had already begun a review of live exports the previous year.\n\nAlso read: Comment | Cow and conciliation\n\nMr. O'Connor said the risk to the country\u2019s reputation outweighed any financial gains because there was no way to safeguard the welfare of the animals once they left New Zealand\u2019s shores.\n\n\u201cNew Zealand must stay ahead of the curve in a world where animal welfare is under increasing scrutiny if we truly want to be the most ethical producers of food,\u201d he said.\n\nThe value of the nation\u2019s live animal exports last year was NZ$261 million, a threefold increase from the previous year after exporters rushed to beat any potential ban.

Still, the group said the transition period would give farmers a chance to honor existing commitments and consider their future options.\n\nOpposition lawmaker Mark Cameron, from the libertarian ACT Party, said the decision was emotive, costly and a \u201ckick in the guts\u201d to farmers.\n\nAnimal rights group SAFE, which has long sought a ban, welcomed the news. Chief executive Debra Ashton said animals would no longer suffer in countries with lower welfare standards. Still, Ms. Ashton said it was worried that hundreds of thousands of cows could still be exported by sea over the next two years and that air exports of animals like baby chickens and eels would continue."},

On average, their mass-body index was 31, just above the threshold for obesity.\n\nIntensive care\n\nAround half had no underlying illnesses, such as diabetes, chronic lung conditions, heart or kidney disease, or cancer.

The loss of forest area in these incidents has been estimated at 408 hectares. Four-year data available with the Forest Department indicate that fire inflicted the maximum loss in 2019 when 1,767.05 hectares was charred in 571 incidents between January and April.\n\nLast year, the countrywide lockdown imposed following the COVID-19 pandemic came as a blessing for forest managers as human intervention in forest areas was reduced significantly. It was estimated that 711.02 hectares of forest was lost in 377 incidents last year.\n\nIn 2019, as much as 1,278 hectares was charred in 330 incidents during the four-month-long period.\n\nControl measures\n\nGrasslands that quickly dry up in summer and organic materials that gather on the floor of deciduous forests quickly catches fire. The deployment of fire watchers, reduction of fuel load and early burning are some of the fire-control measures that are conventionally engaged by the Forest Department, said Rajesh Raveendran, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest, who is coordinating the drive.\n\nThe month of February, revealed the fire data, is the blaze-prone month in a fire season that begins by December. It is also the period when the maximum number of festivals in temples located on hilltops takes place and there would be increased human interactions on the forest fringes, which could possibly trigger wildfire, he said.\n\nThe summer showers that the State receives during the March-April period cool the atmosphere and reduces the chances of fire. Termites feed on the vegetation which gets soaked in the summer showers, thus reducing the fire risk, he explained.\n\nBlock-based system\n\nThis time, the Forest Department implemented a block-based decentralised fire management system after identifying highly fire-prone areas.\n\nPlans are afoot to draw up action plans for all the blocks and forest stations of the State for the 2022 season by April this year.\n\nThe plans for the forest circle will be in place by July. The registration of all staff under the Forest Fire Alert system of the Forest Survey of India will also be completed, he said."},

For elderly people, the severity is more as they have comorbidities. Last year, people were scared to go outside, which is not the case now. This month, we have seen dozens of people in their 20s and 30s, college students and married couples, who said they had gone for a trip or a party and got infected after it,\u201d said Dr. Byotra.\n\nEpidemiologist and president of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), Delhi, K. Srinath Reddy, said more young people getting infected is a trend in other parts of the country too.\n\n\u201cEven in the United Kingdom, more young people are getting infected,\u201d he said. Head of Department of Critical Care at Holy Family Hospital Sumit Ray said there are three reasons why more people below 45 years of age are testing positive.\n\nThree reasons\n\n\u201cOne, they are more mobile. Two, older people are more cautious and many of them have taken the vaccine. Three, the virus has definitely become more infectious. Earlier in a family of five, two might test positive and later on, two-three might test negative. But now, in most cases all members of a family are testing positive,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Ray said one-fifth of the ICU patients in the hospital are below 45 years of age and one-third in general wards are below 45 years.\n\nMedical Director of Delhi government-run LNJP Hospital Suresh Kumar said that even the young people are developing severe illnesses.\n\n\u201cMany people below the age of 45 are also getting admitted in ICUs,\u201d he said.\n\nSenior Consultant at Indraprastha Apollo Hospital Suranjit Chatterjee said many of the younger people are not following COVID-appropriate behaviour.\n\n\u201cThey are working and going out. Last year, there was a lockdown, but everything is open now. Clinically, there is a suspicion that the virus is more infectious now,\u201d he added."},

Potter, a 26-year veteran, had been on administrative leave following Sunday's shooting, which happened as the Minneapolis area was already on edge over the trial of the first of four police officers in George Floyd's death.\n\nGannon has said he believed Potter mistakenly grabbed her gun when she was going for her Taser. She can be heard on her body camera video shouting \u201cTaser! Taser!\u201d Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said he was \u201cappreciative\u201d that Potter submitted her resignation but that he had not asked for it. Elliott said he was not sure if it was because she had heard that she would soon be fired. He said he hoped her resignation would \u201cbring some calm to the community,\u201d but that he would keep working towards \u201cfull accountability under the law.\u201d \u201cThat's what we're going to continue to work for,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWe have to make sure that justice is served, justice is done. Daunte Wright deserves that, his family deserves that.\u201d The mayor said the new police leadership was committed to working with community leaders and protesters, who say Wright was racially profiled.\n\n\u201cWe're hoping that we're turning over a new leaf now,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm confident of that now.\u201d Wright was shot as police were trying to arrest him on an outstanding warrant.\n\n\u201cI'll Tase you! I'll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!\u201d the officer is heard shouting on her body cam footage released Monday. She draws her weapon after the man breaks free from police outside his car and gets back behind the wheel.\n\nAfter firing a single shot from her handgun, the car speeds away, and the officer is heard saying, \u201cHoly (expletive)! I shot him.\u201d Potter, a 26-year veteran, sent a one-paragraph letter of resignation.\n\n\u201cI have loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community to the best of my ability, but I believe it is in the best interest of the community, the department, and my fellow officers if I resign immediately,\u201d Potter wrote.\n\nWright's father, Aubrey Wright, told ABC's \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Tuesday that he rejects the explanation that Potter mistook her gun for her Taser.\n\n\u201cI lost my son. He's never coming back. I can't accept that. A mistake? That doesn't even sound right. This officer has been on the force for 26 years. I can't accept that,\u201d he said.\n\nProtests erupted for a second night following Sunday's shooting, heightening anxiety in an area already on edge as the Derek Chauvin trial progresses. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck.\n\nChauvin and three other officers were fired the day after Floyd's death. Potter initially was placed on administrative leave during the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigation into Wright's death.\n\nThe Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, the police union, issued a statement Tuesday saying \u201cno conclusions should be made until the investigation is complete.\u201d Body camera footage Gannon released less than 24 hours after the shooting shows three officers around a stopped car, which authorities said was pulled over because it had expired registration tags. When one officer attempts to handcuff Wright, a second officer tells him he's being arrested on a warrant. That's when the struggle begins and Potter shoots Wright.\n\nHe died of a gunshot wound to the chest, according to the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's office.\n\nPotter has experience with investigations into police shootings. Potter was one of the first officers to respond after Brooklyn Center police fatally shot a man who allegedly allegedly tried to stab an officer with a knife in August 2019, according to a report from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.\n\nAfter medics arrived, she told the two officers who shot the man to get into separate squad cars, turn off their body cameras, and not to speak to each other. She was also the police union president for the department and accompanied two other officers involved in the shooting while investigators interviewed them.\n\nCourt records show Wright was being sought after failing to appear in court on charges that he fled from officers and possessed a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police in June.\n\nDemonstrators began to gather shortly after the shooting, with some jumping atop police cars."},

They come in groups and are attracted to light.\n\nRoad users, particularly motorcyclists, are finding it difficult to drive their two-wheelers on the flyover and the adjacent areas. The problem is no different on the bridges on Ryves Canal, Eluru and Bandar canals. As the caddisflies are in good numbers and move closely together, the visibility of motorcyclists has been affected sometimes and they have to slowly push through to cross these stretches. The caddisflies blanket the pavements and roads so thoroughly that sometimes it looks like a white paint.\n\nAccording to information, the caddisflies, which are insects with aquatic larvae, have emerged in huge numbers by the eastern canal, and other canals in the city. The civic authorities, however, have not taken any steps to control their population. In fact, the authorities are \u2018clueless\u2019 and could not take up any special drives to disinfect the canals, which is said to be one of the possible reasons for the caddisfly problem.\n\nK. Praveen Kumar, an entomologist who works with Bayer, says that the caddisflies are found near water bodies or places where stagnant water is found. Certain species are also aggravated due to ecological imbalances, so that could also be a possible reason. Usually the flies are not harmful to people. They tend to form swarms of large numbers and are attracted towards light, he says.\n\nProblems in ecosystem\n\nThe caddisflies are important indicator species, signalling to scientists that an ecosystem has problems. There are species that are more tolerant to pollution and those that are less tolerant not only to pollution but also to water level changes. Some survive downstream of dams very well, others are totally excluded, opines an entomologist at the National Institute of Plant Management, who did not want to be quoted.\n\nThe entomologists say that caddisflies are useful as bioindicators since some are sensitive to water pollution and some species indicate undisturbed habitat, and some indicate degraded habitat. A field assessment is necessary to arrive at the conclusion regarding the caddisflies that swarm the bridges and roads in the city, they opine."},

Nagar pedestrian plaza was one of the landmark achievements.\n\nSlow process\n\nMs. Dilip said developing facilities for the non-motorised transport is a step-by-step process wherein pedestrians took precedence over all other modes of transport with more than 90% of the first- and last-mile connectivity for using various public transport being by walk.\n\nCiting the more than 150 km of safe walking space having been created, she said the next step would be the Mega Street project under which walking and cycling space were proposed to be created in six localities: Anna Nagar, Nungambakkam, Velachery, Adyar, Mylapore and Tondiarpet.\n\nMs. Dilip said: \u201cUnder the Mega Street project proposed by the Chennai Smart City, six urban designers from across the country would be involved in creating the amenities.\u201d\n\nA senior official of the Corporation said the non-motorised transport in Chennai focused primarily on creating safe pavements. Having developed wide and safe pavements for all sections, including the people with disabilities, the focus was shifting to increasing the length of the cycle lanes.\n\nAt present, cycle lanes are available in Besant Nagar, K.K. Nagar, Sardar Patel Road, and sections of Anna Salai. Also under the bicycle sharing project, more than 500 bicycles were put on the roads by creating cycle sharing stations at important places and metro stations.\n\nThe cycle sharing project, which came to a standstill owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, is again revived with a plan to add 500 electric bicycles. As part of this, a survey is also being conducted to make it a pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly city."},

The senior civic official said that having completed pavements on 108 bus route roads, footpath development work was in progress along 70 arterial roads, stretching for 94 km, at a cost of around \u20b9100 crore.

The pavement project was executed under Tamilnadu Urban Road Infrastructure Project (TURIP) funds for over 200 km.\n\nThe pavement-friendly project, which is audited by the Disability Rights Alliance, has been envisaged with various specifications for providing ramps in all building entrances and shifting of all utilities such as electricity junction boxes and transformers which act as hindrances. To avoid parking or riding of vehicles on the pavements and cement concrete bollards were being fixed across the entire length of the pavement, he said."},

The 141 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), other than GHMC, had collected about \u20b9495 crore and another \u20b9226 crore of arrears, making for a total of over \u20b9720 crore.\n\nThe precise demand for the 20,24,315 properties has been \u20b9531 crore with arrears coming to \u20b9268 crore or a total of about \u20b9799 crore, said Director of Municipal Administration (DMA) N. Satyanrayana on Monday.\n\nWhile nine, albeit smaller, municipalities, have registered a cent per cent property tax collection, even mopping up the arrears, 99 ULBs collected property tax of 90% of the demand or more.\n\nThe tax collection is considerably more than the previous fiscal (2019-20) when \u20b9561 crore was collected from the overall demand of \u20b9650 crore or at the rate of 86.3%. Improvement in tax collection was made possible due to formation of special teams, identifying chronic defaulters and allowing citizens to use multiple methods along with digital means to pay up, he said.\n\nAmong the municipalities which registered cent per cent collections are Korutla (Karimnagar) with 15,497 dwellings where the entire demand of \u20b93.55 crore was collected. Among others are Metpalli, also in Karimnagar, with 11,766 dwellings where the demand was raised for about \u20b92.24 crore plus \u20b90.27 crore in arrears.\n\nSircilla with 21,822 dwellings and demand raised for \u20b94.01 crore and arreas of \u20b90.30 crore, \u20b94.32 crore was collected; Kothagudem in Bhadradri-Kothgudem has 18,059 dwellings and demand was raised for \u20b94.22 crore plus \u20b90.39 crore in arrears and a total amount of \u20b94.61 crore was collected.

Chityal in Suryapet with 3,616 properties had demand raised for \u20b90.58 crore including \u20b90.31 crore in arreas, and \u20b90.89 crore was collected. Dubbaka in Nalgonda with 5,418 properties raised a demand for \u20b90.86 crore plus \u20b90.30 crore in arrears to collect \u20b91.16 crore.\n\nThere were other ULBs which collected 98% of the tax on demand like Peddapalli, Khammam, Manuguru, Yellandu, Nrmal, Tandur, Vikarabad, Parigi, Gundlapochampally, Bodhan, Kamareddy, Bhongir, Suryapet, Huzurnagar, Nalgonda, Miryalguda, Gajwel, Sangareddy, Toopran and Nagarkurnool.\n\nLow collection\n\nULBs with relatively poor collection in comparison to the tune of 56-97% include Kothakota, Chandur, Warangal, Shankarpally, Bandlaguda Jagir, Nizampet, Alair and Devarkonda.

More people are being infected and at a faster rate than before. Vaccination roll-out strategies targeting selected groups must be rapidly expanded along with public health efforts to bring normalcy.\n\nIn a recent letter to the Prime Minister, the Indian Medical Association has suggested that vaccination be allowed for all people above the age of 18 years. India has one of the highest proportion of young people with co-morbidities, including cancer, diabetes and tuberculosis, in the world. With a large part of COVID-19 deaths in India occurring due to co-morbidities, there is a compelling case for young people in universities and HEIs to be given priority in vaccination.\n\nCritical disparity\n\nThe case for mass vaccination involving students, faculty and staff in HEIs is not without precedent. Cornell University in the U.S. intends to have a requirement of vaccination for students returning to certain campuses, which not only has a direct positive impact on restoring academic continuity, but also curtails high-risk asymptomatic transmission. On-campus learning transcends conventional didactic approaches by offering experiential learning and co/extra-curricular activities that are impossible to replicate virtually. Some of these will have to be redesigned to follow COVID-19 protocols.\n\nIn 2020, while some HEIs initiated digital reforms to ensure academic continuity, many institutions faced impending challenges broadly around two key constraints. Privileged public and private HEIs were able to build the governance and infrastructural capacity for digital transformation to ensure academic continuity, supported by the Ministry of Education through several initiatives. SWAYAM deserves a special mention here. However, low Internet penetration and limited power and technology infrastructure impacted universities and students, particularly in rural India.\n\nMultiple institutions have replicated the physical experience of campuses in the virtual world through pedagogical innovations and using technology to drive social engagement. However, all universities in India may not have the resources required to do so in the online space. In order to meet these challenges, close gaps and give a reasonable holistic academic experience, our public health efforts and vaccination strategies may have to reflect this very critical disparity.\n\nTwo concerns\n\nAt this stage, one may consider the possibility of resuming university campuses with upgraded infrastructure and COVID-19 protocols, but one must keep in mind two concerns of high-risk exposure and logistical complexities. First, universities host a large number of students, faculty and staff members representing diverse demographic groups. Since the essence of most campuses is to promote social interactions, their \u2018normal\u2019 functioning can increase the risk of infection. While the magnitude of risk varies, this is true for campuses with day scholars and fully residential campuses. With such high exposure and cumulatively rising risk of transmissibility, a vaccination strategy that involves them can help curtail the spread and revitalise their learning experience.\n\nSecond, reopening campuses will entail complex logistical implementation to ensure health and safety on campus. However, only a handful of institutions have been fortunate to make infrastructure enhancements in the past year. Also, while norms of social distancing and masks can be deployed, sustaining the rigour of adhering to all protocols will be strenuous for some. Compared to corporate organisations where it is easier to deploy such norms and protocols, we must be mindful of the challenges of doing the same for and in universities.\n\nThe recent spike in COVID-19 cases upon commencement of physical classes among certain renowned Indian universities reinforces the importance of vaccination prior to reopening. More than 37 million students enrolled in higher education, along with the university faculty and staff, is a number that is feasible for a special vaccination drive to be planned and executed. Since at least three months are needed for two doses and to ensure an effective immune response, the implementation of such a programme for all HEIs must begin by May for timely commencement of on-campus learning this year.\n\nC.

That they made time to hold their 17th meeting is good news. They advanced the agenda, which had been arrested by the pandemic, since the last ministerial meeting held in August 2018. Their major task was to pave the way for the next summit, the grouping\u2019s fifth, due to be held in Sri Lanka in the \u201cnext few months\u201d.\n\nWhile most multilateral groupings from G20 to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) held their deliberations at the highest political level in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, BIMSTEC leaders failed to do so. In contrast to a meeting of even SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) leaders held at India\u2019s initiative a year ago, BIMSTEC could not arrange its ministerial meeting until April 2021. This is due as much to contextual factors as the diplomatic environment prevailing today.\n\nUnfolding rejuvenation\n\nEstablished as a grouping of four nations \u2014 India, Thailand, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka \u2014 through the Bangkok Declaration of 1997 to promote rapid economic development, BIMSTEC was expanded later to include three more countries \u2014 Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan. It moved at a leisurely pace during its first 20 years with only three summits held and a record of modest achievements. But it suddenly received special attention as New Delhi chose to treat it as a more practical instrument for regional cooperation over a faltering SAARC. The BIMSTEC Leaders\u2019 Retreat, followed by their Outreach Summit with the BRICS leaders in Goa in October 2016, drew considerable international limelight to the low-profile regional grouping. This also opened up the path for its rejuvenation.\n\nThe fourth leaders\u2019 summit, held in Kathmandu in August 2018, devised an ambitious plan for institutional reform and renewal that would encompass economic and security cooperation. It took the important decision to craft a charter to provide BIMSTEC with a more formal and stronger foundation. The shared goal now is to head towards \u201ca Peaceful, Prosperous and Sustainable Bay of Bengal Region\u201d. At the second swearing-in of the Modi government in May 2019, the leaders of BIMSTEC, not SAARC, were invited as honoured guests. Soon thereafter, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar observed that India saw a mix of \u201cenergy, mindset and possibility\u201d in BIMSTEC.\n\nRecent decisions\n\nTwo and a half years after the Kathmandu Summit, the grouping stands ready to move forward. The foreign ministers cleared the draft for the BIMSTEC charter, recommending its early adoption. They endorsed the rationalisation of sectors and sub-sectors of activity, with each member-state serving as a lead for the assigned areas of special interest. The ministers also conveyed their support for the Master Plan for Transport Connectivity, which will be adopted at the next summit. Preparations have been completed for the signing of three agreements relating to mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, cooperation between diplomatic academies, and the establishment of a technology transfer facility in Colombo.\n\nWhat has been missing from recent deliberations is a reference to the lack of progress on the trade and economic dossier. A January 2018 study by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry had suggested that BIMSTEC urgently needed a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement to be a real game changer. Ideally it should cover trade in goods, services and investment; promote regulatory harmonisation; adopt policies that develop regional value chains; and eliminate non-tariff barriers. Also lacking was an effort to enthuse and engage the vibrant business communities of these seven countries, and expand their dialogue, interactions and transactions. On this score, BIMSTEC remains a work in progress. Over 20 rounds of negotiations to operationalise the BIMSTEC Free Trade Area Framework Agreement, signed in 2004, are yet to bear fruit.\n\nIn contrast, much has been achieved in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief and security, including counterterrorism, cyber security, and coastal security cooperation. India has led through constant focus and follow-up \u2014 to the extent that some member-states have complained about the \u2018over-securitisation\u2019 of BIMSTEC. The trick to ensure balance is not to go slow on security but to accelerate the pace of forging solid arrangements for economic cooperation. Similarly, while national business chambers are yet to be optimally engaged with the BIMSTEC project, the academic and strategic community has shown ample enthusiasm through the BIMSTEC Network of Policy Think Tanks and other fora.\n\nObstacles\n\nThe goal now should be to overcome the obstacles leading to BIMSTEC\u2019s success. First, a strong BIMSTEC presupposes cordial and tension-free bilateral relations among all its member-states. This has not been the case, given the trajectory of India-Nepal, India-Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh-Myanmar ties in recent years. Second, uncertainties over SAARC hovers, complicating matters. Both Kathmandu and Colombo want the SAARC summit revived, even as they cooperate within BIMSTEC, with diluted zeal. Third, China\u2019s decisive intrusion in the South-Southeast Asian space has cast dark shadows. A renowned Bangladeshi scholar argued at a recent conference that BIMSTEC would make progress if China is accepted as its principal interlocutor and partner. This perspective has hardly any takers in India and its friendly partners in the grouping. Finally, the military coup in Myanmar, brutal crackdown of protesters and continuation of popular resistance resulting in a protracted impasse have produced a new set of challenges. Despite them, the BIMSTEC foreign ministers could meet virtually \u2014 but will it be as easy for the summit to be held, with the much-maligned Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing in attendance at Colombo?\n\nAs BIMSTEC readies itself to celebrate the silver jubilee of its formation next year, it faces a serious challenge: to effect \u201ca paradigm-shift in raising the level of our cooperation and regional integration\u201d, as Mr. Jaishankar said on April 1. The grouping needs to reinvent itself, possibly even rename itself as \u2018The Bay of Bengal Community\u2019. It should consider holding regular annual summits. Only then will its leaders convince the region about their strong commitment to the new vision they have for this unique platform linking South Asia and Southeast Asia.\n\nRajiv Bhatia is Distinguished Fellow, Gateway House and a former Ambassador to Myanmar"},

The SARS-CoV-2 infection causes COVID-19. Doctors initially did not know how best to treat patients with COVID-19. Thus, in the first few months, clinical care was dominated by opinion, anecdotes and dogma. An example is the hype surrounding hydroxychloroquine as a potential cure for COVID-19. It took a huge global effort to prove that hydroxychloroquine does not benefit COVID-19 patients. One year on, there is still rampant misinformation on cures for COVID-19, with steam inhalation, multivitamins, mineral supplements, and drugs such as ivermectin, and chloroquine, all of which have not been demonstrated to treat COVID-19, still being prescribed.\n\nClinical trials\n\nHigh-quality evidence that informs best practice for treatments comes from randomised clinical trials. Until these trials produced results, what doctors did was treat symptoms and provide life support. Treatments include oxygen, breathing support in the form of mechanical ventilation in severely ill patients, and supporting other vital organs such as kidneys with dialysis and heart with blood pressure medications. Many COVID-19 patients developed blood clots and were therefore treated with blood thinning medications.\n\nCOVID-19 was a clarion call for generating such high-quality evidence at pace, in particular designing trials to test multiple treatments simultaneously with innovative designs such as platform trials and adaptive trials. The RECOVERY trial network in the U.K., the REMAP-CAP trial globally focusing on critically ill patients, and the WHO-led SOLIDARITY trial globally are examples of this approach. RECOVERY demonstrated the lack of benefit with hydroxychroloquine, azithromycin, lopanivir-ritonavir, colchicine and convalescent plasma. REMAP-CAP highlighted harm with use of hydroxychroloquine and lopanivir-ritonavir and demonstrated that there is no benefit with convalescent plasma. SOLIDARITY also highlighted the lack of benefit from many of these drugs, including Remdesivir, an antiviral drug that perhaps shortens the illness duration. It is important that lack of benefit of these drugs reported in well-conducted clinical trials should be translated into clinical practice by healthcare professionals managing COVID-19 patients.\n\nDrugs that work\n\nLet us also consider the drugs that have been proven to benefit COVID-19 patients. We have learnt that corticosteroids (dexamethasone) is effective in COVID-19 patients who need oxygen and in critically ill patients (hydrocortisone). These cheap and universally available drugs have saved thousands of lives. More recently, we have emerging evidence that two interleukin-6 receptor blocking drugs (tocilizumab and sarilumab) benefit COVID-19 patients, including enhanced benefit when used in combination with corticosteroids, particularly in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. It is important to note the emerging evidence with heparin (a blood thinning medication). Heparin possibly harms critically ill COVID-19 patients whilst potentially benefiting non-critically ill COVID-19 patients. Therefore translating these high-quality evidence into clinical practice by healthcare professionals would involve administering corticosteroids and interleukin-6 receptor blocking drugs when treating COVID-19 patients who are moderate to severely ill as per the WHO clinical criteria. Indiscriminate use of steroids and blood thinners in mildly ill patients with COVID-19 who do not need oxygen or any other organ support must be avoided.\n\nThe pandemic continues to exert pressure on healthcare systems. It is important that apart from supportive care (oxygen, ventilatory support), the only drugs shown to reduce mortality are steroids and interleukin-6 receptor blocking drugs. Do not prescribe ineffective treatments to patients with COVID-19.\n\nA.V. Ramanan is Professor of Paediatric Rheumatology, University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, and M.

It is also upon the lessons learnt from the implementation of the previous plans and based on learnings from across the country with respect to implementation of various projects and schemes, the DDA said.\n\nFuture-ready city\n\nSome of the salient features of the plan, the DDA said, is to make Delhi an environmentally responsible, future-ready city focusing on ease of living, good quality, affordable, clean and safe living environments and efficient mobility options to all. It also seeks to make Delhi a vibrant economic, creative and cultural hub that attracts talent and facilitates livelihood opportunities for everyone.\n\nOther features of the plan, the DDA said, is to make it a more people-friendly document that is easy to read and understand by the general public apart from professionals. It has provisions for green-blue areas for active/passive recreation and leisure and enhances Delhi\u2019s preparedness for climate change impacts and in tackling pollution.\n\nThe plan also has special provisions for preservation and redevelopment within identified heritage and cultural precincts with regeneration in the old and dilapidated areas by providing incentives for planned redevelopment.\n\nThe first master plan was promulgated in 1962 under the Delhi Development Act 1957, followed by the plans of 2001 and 2021, each of which is an extensive modification of the respective previous plan document."},

Therefore, it is our only hope to prevent overburdened health systems which are suffering from COVID-19 fatigue, from collapsing when cases are surging again. The emergence of new variants from time to time and the declining neutralising antibody levels as some studies show, might contribute to the lack of protection against reinfection. But this should not deter people from getting vaccinated. The Sputnik V vaccine will be another arrow in the quiver in the war against the pandemic. Booster doses may be required or the vaccine may have to be tweaked against the newer variants. We also have to step up genomic surveillance and research for second generation vaccines which will be effective against the variants. Vaccination and COVID-19 appropriate behaviour are our only tools against this raging pandemic.\n\nDr. Thomas Palocaren,\n\nVellore, Tamil Nadu\n\nWhen the daily case load began declining in November last year everyone assumed that the virus was on the wane. Added to this was the news in January that two vaccines were ready for use. Therefore, people began to think that the war against the dreaded virus was being won. Very few would have thought that the virus would evolve differently and even virologists and health professionals must have been caught unawares. Everyone should remain alert and follow procedures.\n\nA. Michael Dhanaraj,\n\nCoimbatore\n\nThe resurgence of the virus is alarming, snatching lives without any let-up. Though the Centre appears to be putting in place steps to keep the second wave at bay, the States concerned do not seem to be looking at the gravamen of the matter in its sincerity; the guidelines for now do not seem to address the issue. With the economy open now, balanced steps will have to be taken.\n\nMani Nataraajan,\n\nChennai\n\nI have come across defects in surgical masks being sold. Some of them are from reputed pharmacies. Medical surgical masks are generally of three layers \u2014 some have four \u2014 with the materials used as a sandwich of spunbond, meltblown and spunbond materials. Each plays a part in blocking aerosols and micro-respiratory particles and key to COVID-19 prevention. In most cases, I have found the meltblown fabric missing. COVID-19 infection is spreading like wildfire and the government is asking everyone to wear a mask. If people are wearing defective masks, are we not increasing the risks?\n\nN. Arulmozhidevan,\n\nChennai\n\nBattle for Bengal\n\nThe desperation of the BJP to win West Bengal is clearly showing. After managing to lure many members of the TMC to its fold, the party must have expected Mamata Banerjee to capitulate. The Prime Minister and the Home Minister appear to be spending way too much time in Bengal campaigning when there is a major crisis that threatens to derail the nation. The economy is facing a dangerous situation and it may not take much for it to be overwhelmed. Perhaps the top leader of the land finds winning Bengal of greater importance than defeating the coronavirus.\n\nAnthony Henriques,\n\nMumbai\n\nEducation now\n\nChildren and the young have been experiencing a very hard time ever since the pandemic broke out. The future of lakhs of students who are preparing for examinations and competitive exams is at stake as their only source of support at the moment are online classes which are very inadequate. The well-off students have all the support as they can engage home teachers. At least when it comes to education, all political parties need to find a common solution. It is politics that is helping many a State abdicate its responsibility of ensuring proper education.\n\nN.

The level of election-related violence and its duration vary but it is there.\n\nSo what does that fact show? What does it establish?\n\nThat Bengal is a violent state and Bengalis are a violent people?\n\nCertainly not.\n\nNot just Bengal-centric\n\nThey are no more violent than any other part of India or section of Indian society when provoked, instigated, manipulated to think, speak and act violently. One has to only refer to the speeches made on the eve of Direct Action Day in 1946 at the Maidan, in Calcutta, to understand what I mean. Within hours of those incendiary speeches the city was bleeding. An estimated 4,000 people were killed. Very shortly thereafter, incitement and instigation doing their worst, the Noakhali region of East Pakistan saw appalling violence perpetrated on the Hindu minority there, with an estimated 5,000 killed. Bihar responded with matching fury, killing, according to information given to the British Parliament an equal number of its Muslim minority and, according to The Statesman, twice as many. A peace-cherishing province was leveraged thus into peace-shattering violence.\n\nBattered as it was, Bengal was \u2018bettered\u2019 by other areas. The worst instance of Partition-time violence among all regions, took place in Punjab. \u201cVirtually,\u201d says Wikipedia, \u201cno Muslim survived in East Punjab (except in Malerkotla) and virtually no Hindu or Sikh survived in West Punjab.\u201d All this was around the partitioning of India. Much later, in the anti-Sikh riots in 1984 an estimated 2,800 were killed in Delhi, and another 3,350 nationwide. These are official figures, the actual numbers are likely to have been much bigger. In the Gujarat riots of 2002, official estimates put the toll at 1,044. The actual numbers, again, are perhaps much bigger.\n\nSo, let no one tar Bengal and Bengalis with the sweeping description of \u2018violent\u2019 . They are only as violent or non-violent as any other part of India or its people, not a whit more. Maoist violence, the other ogre that has menaced life in Bengal, is not by any means confined to the State where Naxalbari lies, but is spread across over 200 districts across nine States.\n\nSpreading hate\n\nThe violence that marred phase four of the eight phase elections now being held in the State is most unfortunate and to be bemoaned. But our distress over it misses another far more important, much more serious and infinitely more dangerous form of violence that is accompanying the elections in West Bengal.\n\nThat violence is being done to the mind of Bengal, to its thinking wires, its feeling nerves, to its very soul. It is being done by the unrelenting spread of the virus of communal hate, of sectarian animosity of the \u2018line\u2019 that Hindus and Muslims are different breeds of human species. Whichever side of the communal divide it comes from, hatred as an idea and a strategy is no less violent than \u2018plain\u2019 violence. Once planted, it incubates in the minds and hearts of people, like a virus, and then erupts with an uncontrollable febrile frenzy.\n\nThe Partition years\n\nThe then Muslim League Premier of undivided Bengal, H.S. Suhrawardy, had much to explain for the violence that disfigured Bengal in 1946 and 1947. On Suhrawardy\u2019s last day in that office, August 14, 1947, he had on his hands a challenging \u2018guest\u2019 \u2014 Gandhi, who was staying in Hydari Manzil, at the Muslim quarter of Beliaghata in Calcutta. At his prayer meeting that evening, over 10,000 people gathered in the grounds around that house to hear him. It was the month of Ramzan. Pyarelal records in his iconic biography (Mahatma Gandhi \u2013 The Last Phase, Navajivan, pp. 368-9), that some in the congregation shouted, \u201cWhere is Suhrawardy?\u201d Suhrawardy was inside that house at the time, engaged in namaz. Gandhi told them that. After the prayer meeting gave over and Gandhi returned to the house, there was an uproar. Many had surrounded the house, which at Gandhi\u2019s behest was un-policed, and demanded that Suhrawardy appear. Gandhi opened a window and got Suhrawardy to stand beside him, resting one hand on the outgoing Premier\u2019s shoulder.\n\nOne of the crowd to the Premier: \u201cAre you not responsible for the Great Calcutta Killing?\u201d\n\nSuhrawardy: \u201cYes, we all are.\u201d\n\n\u2018Will you answer my question, please?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it was my responsibility\u201d.\n\nPyarelal writes: \u201cThis unequivocal, straight and candid answer by one who had made arrogance and haughtiness his badge and never known humility had a profound effect on the crowd.\u201d But the incubating virus was working still. Riots broke out within days in Calcutta, viciously. Two young men, Sachindranath Mitra, 37, and Smritish Banerjea, 38, interposing between rioting mobs, were killed on the spot. On hearing that a truck carrying Muslim labourers had a bomb thrown on it in the same area \u2014 Beliaghata \u2014 killing two of them, Gandhi went to the scene. A four anna piece was lying near one of them that had rolled out of the daily wager\u2019s waist band. Gandhi started a defining fast. It was in complete and exact harmony with the mind and soul of Ramakrishna\u2019s, Vivekananda\u2019s and Tagore\u2019s Bengal. And equally, with the stoic Bengal of the two simple, humble but absolutely true Bengalis, Sachindranath and Smritish.\n\n\u201cThere should no longer be any more Hindu-Muslim riots in Calcutta\u2026\u201d the fasting Gandhi told Bengal\u2019s leaders who implored him not to fast . \u201cI shall terminate my fast if all of you accept this responsibility.\u201d Seventy or so hours after his fast had begun, a group of leaders came to him to report that the innate good sense of the majority of the people of the city had prevailed over the furies let loose by the rioters. The mob that killed and burnt was not Bengal. The majority that stilled the mayhem, was.\n\n\u201cWe the undersigned,\u201d the leaders said in a paper they gave to him , \u201cpromise to Gandhiji that peace and quiet have been restored in Calcutta once again. We shall never again allow communal strife in the city. And shall strive unto death to prevent it.\u201d Among the signatories were Suhrawardy and N.C. Chatterjee, the Hindu Mahasabha leader. Netaji\u2019s elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose, was a third.\n\nBengal then and now\n\nThat was and is Bengal. Its antibodies against the virus are strong. Its immune system is active. But if the load of the viral inoculum is huge, the balance can get affected. It can collapse.\n\nBeliaghata 1947, representing Bengal\u2019s immune system, checked the virus. It has, by and large, remained in check. In 1971, 50 years ago, the virus all but disappeared, with the State hailing the return of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Rahman to Dhaka and the birth of Bangladesh, even as another Tagore composition \u2014 \u201cAmar Sonar Bangla\u201d \u2014 became the national anthem of the new nation.\n\nBengal\u2019s immune system should be spared the challenge of an overload of the communal virus. It is one thing to go through an election that seeks to win its favour; quite another to have a Radcliffe Line of hatred cut through its mind and torment its soul.\n\nBeliaghata 1947, Bangladesh 1971 and the ballot for Bengal 2021 bear witness to its covenants with life unto death.\n\nGopalkrishna Gandhi is a former administrator, diplomat and governor"},

U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s \u2018Leaders\u2019 Summit on Climate\u2019 scheduled for April 22-23 will also set the stage for major countries to outline their plans. One thing is clear: Climate action and climate leadership are being increasingly measured against a planetary imperative of emissions reducing to net-zero by 2050. This presents a conundrum for fast-growing developing countries such as India. They need the carbon space to develop but they are also among the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Is there an equitable way to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions for the planet?\n\nRecent debates on whether India should declare a net-zero year or withstand mounting pressure have centred around two alternative strategies. The first is to delegitimise long-term targets. This view proposes focusing on measurable near-term progress, and paints the long-term (the year 2050 and beyond) as too far to be meaningful in terms of progress towards a deeply decarbonised world. The alternative approach argues that without long-term targets, the path to decarbonisation has little certainty.\n\nFine points\n\nThis polarised debate needs some nuance. Consider the analogy of a retirement plan. It is a must for everyone. However young, we need to start saving now to meet the goals of a financially secure retirement. It would be foolish to not have a retirement plan on the grounds that it is in the distant future, that medical sciences might advance, or that we could consider retirement properly when we are richer in middle age. To only focus on smaller savings in our youth would ignore the compounding effect that actions today have in the long run. Planning for emissions mitigation is similar: The short- and the long-term cannot be delinked.\n\nAmbitious renewable energy targets, improvements in energy efficiency and fast penetration of electric vehicles are among India\u2019s critical low-carbon objectives in the next decade. Yet, rapid advances in these do not substitute for the need to set a clear direction of travel with the aim to reduce emissions to net-zero. Avoiding this choice makes India look like a climate laggard when its actions actually speak louder than the words of many developed countries.\n\nIndia needs to replan\n\nIndia should, instead, reframe the net-zero debate from the perspective of the planet and for the prosperity of its people. India had ensured that \u201cclimate justice\u201d was inserted in the preamble to the Paris Agreement. As the climate crisis unfolds, climate justice should imply that humanity respects the planetary boundary of permissible greenhouse gases but also ensures that countries assume equitable responsibility based on their past and future emissions. This approach would be different from merely blaming developed countries for historical emissions and, instead, would establish the criteria by which economic advancement and climate responsibility could go hand-in-hand.\n\nWe propose a formulation that combines per capita income and aggregate emissions. The World Bank classifies a high-income economy as one with gross national per capita income of $12,536 or more in 2019 prices. Any high-income country should not get more than 15-20 years to achieve net-zero emissions from 2020 onwards. This would imply that the European Union or the United States reach net-zero no later than 2035-40, rather than 2050 as they currently propose. China will enter this income category after 2025, so it should achieve net-zero by 2045, rather than 2060 as it proposes. India is expected to become a high-income economy around 2050, and it should target net-zero close to 2070. As a recent Council on Energy, Environment and Water report shows, today\u2019s high-income countries would still have a much longer transition period between peaking emissions and net-zero than India would get.\n\nIssue of aggregrate emissions\n\nHowever, per capita income cannot be an excuse for inaction in correcting emissions-intensive development pathways. Aggregate emissions also matter. The historical (past century) and future (this century) aggregate emissions of each country not yet in the high-income category should aim to be progressively smaller than those which have achieved high-income status. This approach acknowledges the potential to tap into technological advances and cost reductions and reinforces the need to give a long-term net-zero signal. (This is how India benefited from falling solar costs over the past decade and was able to aim higher for its renewable energy ambitions.) This approach would trigger a rethink about each country\u2019s sustainable development priorities and sectoral pathways \u2014 and create the conditions for further innovation and investment in climate-friendly infrastructure, technologies, business models, and lifestyle and behavioural changes. As the suite of mitigation technologies becomes more widely available and cheaper, all countries could achieve net-zero much earlier.\n\nThe debate between prioritising only near-term actions versus announcing long-term net-zero goals presents a false binary. Both are needed to establish certainty of action, credibility of promises and create incentives for markets to respond. The real debate should be about climate justice for people and the planet. India would do well to propose alternative formulations that establish equity, differentiate the pace of desired action, and yet be progressive in its ambitions.\n\nVaibhav Chaturvedi is Fellow and Arunabha Ghosh is CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water"}
