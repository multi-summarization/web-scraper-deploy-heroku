In the next fiscal, we will buy 200,000 tonnes to prevent price rise,\u201d consumer affairs secretary Leena Nandan said on Monday.</p><p>Since onions are a common base ingredient of most Indian dishes and therefore widely consumed, consumers behaviourally are quite sensitive to a rise in onion prices, relative to many other commodities.</p><p>Market watchers, however, point to a familiar pattern in India\u2019s onion-price spirals. Retail rates soar every alternate year or so especially during the lean monsoon months when stocks from stored onions dwindle and fresh harvests are still to reach markets. It is not uncommon for prices to crash either.</p><p>Last year, the government banned the export of onions as prices crossed the psychological <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>100 to a kg mark after extreme weather destroyed crops and harvests.</p><p>\u201cThere are three onion crops in a year.

That was the intent behind the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act,\u201d the top bureaucrat told HT.</p><p>Onion trade in the country suffers from classic price volatility, a term used for regular patterns of wild swings in prices. It is caused mainly because of supply-disrupting factors like extreme weather, high losses from inadequate or improper storage, or frequent shifting of production levels.</p><p>The consumer affairs secretary also said her ministry had undertaken a major campaign throughout the country to publicise rules under the amended Consumer Protection Act, especially to rural consumers by utilising Panchayati raj institutions, Krishi Vigyan Kendras, post offices and common service centres, including e-filing of consumer complaints.</p>"},

It had to choose between two powerful communities \u2014 the most backward Vanniyars of the north or the backward Thevars of the south in Tamil Nadu. Which way it would tilt would impact its performance in the April 6 elections.</p><p>AIADMK\u2019s ally, the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), had revived their age-old demand for 20% internal reservation for their core vote bank \u2014 the Vanniyar community. PMK struck in the backdrop of the return from prison of former AIADMK leader VK Sasikala who vowed to lead the party. Sasikala, who wielded power behind-the-scenes when she lived with late J Jayalalithaa for three decades, helped make key appointments from the Mukkulathor sub-sect of the Thevar community that she as well as deputy chief minister O Paneerselvam belong to.</p><p>During seat sharing negotiations, Union home minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Amit Shah is also said to have broached the support base of the Thevars towards Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran, which would contribute to a win in at least 25 seats. But chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, who was handpicked by Sasikala and the AIADMK, has stonewalled the family, concerned about being sidelined himself if he accommodated them.</p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/tamil-nadu-assembly-election/stalin-takes-dig-at-aiadmk-says-can-promise-helicopter-for-everyone-101615870647445.html\">Stalin takes dig at AIADMK, says can promise helicopter for everyone</a></b></p><p>An hour before the model code of conduct came into effect, Palaniswami passed a legislation for a 10.5% internal reservation for the Vanniyar community within the existing Most Backward Classes (MBC) reservation for public jobs and education, which the PMK celebrated. The following day, PMK reduced its seat demands and settled for 23 seats; it is now the second largest party in the National Democratic Alliance. Sasikala decided to \u201cstep away\u201d from politics.</p><p>The AIADMK\u2019s compromise with the PMK has deepened the caste divide as it has angered other communities. A faction of the Thevar community in Tenkasi village threatened to boycott the elections unless the quota is revoked.</p><p>But the entire episode throws light on both the nature of caste politics in Tamil Nadu, and the NDA\u2019s attempts to capitalise on the support of sub castes within backward communities which feel excluded from the benefits of reservations. It is, in that sense, a repeat of the BJP\u2019s attempts in north India to play on the heterogeneity within backward and Dalit castes, and create a coalition with the more marginalised segments of society. But the roots of this form of politics go deeper in the state.</p><p><b>The history and arithmetic of caste politics</b></p><p>Though the Dravidian movement envisioned an anti-Brahmanical and a caste-free society, the principal parties born of the ideology \u2014 the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and AIADMK \u2014 became increasingly dependent on caste-based parties for their electoral advantage. Tickets are issued to candidates from influential caste groups with respect to their constituencies. Political analysts say that national parties such as BJP which is trying to make inroads into the state are following a similar formula of drawing support from sub-castes to consolidate votes. The Congress, too, has survived in Tamil Nadu, albeit as a minor force, as caste groups such as the Hindu Nadars emerged as an important support base, making Kanyakumari the latter\u2019s stronghold which was an erstwhile Communist bastion.</p><p>Caste-based politics was cemented with the split of the DMK in 1972 when MG Ramachandran (MGR) broke away and emerged as one of the most successful chief ministers of the state, founding the ADMK later renamed AIADMK. \u201cMGR mobilised caste-based- constituencies and he had vociferous support from the Dalits and scheduled castes,\u201d says S Ananthi of the Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) who researches on Dravidian politics and caste. Besides them, Thevars too moved towards the AIADMK, which was fiercely consolidated by the Jayalalithaa and Sasikala combine.</p><p>The DMK, for its part, has a considerable Vanniyar base which the PMK has partially eaten into but not wholly, say analysts. \u201cAIADMK needs PMK\u2019s support which is why they go out of their way to deal with them,\u201d says Ramu Manivannan, head, politics and public administration, University of Madras. \u201cDMK controls the Vanniyar community by polarising them and has a considerable number of Vanniyar leaders. Karunanidhi consciously cultivated that kind of resistance within the community.\u201d</p><p><b>Also Read | <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/tamil-nadu-assembly-election/which-way-for-dravidian-politics-in-tamil-nadu-in-2021-101615848141732.html\">Which way for Dravidian politics in Tamil Nadu in 2021?</a></b></p><p>\u201cThe stable voters for DMK are men particularly those who grew up along with DMK\u2019s history and agitations. They still think they are guardians of Tamil people,\u201d says political commentator Maalan Narayanan. \u201cThe lower-middle class benefited from both DMK and AIADMK in terms of access to jobs and education because of reservation (69%). OBCs are committed to both parties but women within these communities are Jayalalithaa\u2019s vote bank.\u201d</p><p>Jayalalithaa had rolled out several schemes for women such as gold for mangalsutra; budget canteens from 2013, which have employed thousands of women from self-help groups; Amma Baby Care Kit, which was launched with a dozen items including a feeding bottle, clothing, toy, sanitary napkins for new mothers; and, from 2016, subsidies on two-wheelers for working women. DMK and AIADMK have introduced a slew of sops for women in their election manifestos as women outnumber the male electorate in Tamil Nadu.</p><p><b>The BJP\u2019s push </b></p><p>While the DMK traditionally enjoys support from the delta and southern districts where the Nadars are present, this community is said to be moving towards the BJP. The state BJP unit\u2019s former chief, Tamilisai Soundararajan, who is presently Governor of Telangana with additional charge as Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry, belongs to the Nadar community and the present chief, L Murugan, is a Dalit leader.</p><p>\u201cThe last BJP Brahmin chief in the state was L Ganesan. Now BJP is appointing OBCs and Dalits as their office bearers with the only idea of expanding their base,\u201d says Maalan. A BJP leader and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) pracharak, who did not wish to be named, said that few in the old guard are unhappy with new recruits who don\u2019t have an RSS base and jump ship from other parties. \u201cWe are not against other castes but what do they know about Hindutva when they suddenly join the party before elections?\u201d Ganesan, however, dismissed it and said, \u201cBJP in Tamil Nadu is finally coming of age.\u201d</p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, at a government function in Chennai, said that the Centre had accepted a long-standing demand by members of the Devendrakula Velalar community that they should be known by their heritage name, a day after a bill to modify the list of Scheduled Castes in Tamil Nadu was introduced in the Lok Sabha. The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order (Amendment) Bill 2021, proposed by the state government, would group together seven castes to be known as the Devendrakula Velalar. \u201cThey told me they pleaded and pleaded with governments, but nothing changed,\u201d Modi had said then, and remarked that \u201cDevendra\u201d rhymes with his name \u201cNarendra\u201d and the name change would give them much-awaited justice, dignity and opportunity.</p><p>\u201cAfter that, you don\u2019t see BJP leaders talking about it because other communities (agamudayar, vellalars, kallars) have protested and said that they won\u2019t vote for the BJP,\u201d says Manivannan. \u201cModi speaks like he does in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (UP) but it can\u2019t work here. Passing a legislation on Devendrakula Velalars is an example of the UP formula they applied here which is an assimilation of caste identity and the politics of exclusion and inclusion. But if caste lines fell in order, Tamil Nadu would have seen a grand caste coalition rather than a party coalition.\u201d</p><p>Narayanan adds that OBCs support for the BJP is growing slowly in the state. Traditionally, the saffron party had the support of only the Brahmins pockets and Saurashtrians who have migrated from Gujarat and predominantly settled in Madurai as weavers. \u201cPost-Ayodhya movement, there was considerable support from Thevars as Muthuramalinga Thevar (a patriarch of the community). But it will take the BJP at least another six years to attract the gamut of OBCs.\u201d</p><p>A caste churning is also happening within the AIADMK which was dominated by the Thevars. With Sasikala presently out of the picture, the community is being challenged with the equally powerful Gounders, who enjoy more clout as chief minister Palaniswami and his top Cabinet ministers belong to this community from the western region. \u201cThe Thevar caste advantage of the AIADMK will melt through Sasikala and Dhinakaran and DMK will benefit from the fallout of this battle in at least 30 seats,\u201d says Manivannan.</p><p>What is clear is that a range of factors \u2014 from Sasikala\u2019s exit and its impact on the Thevar vote to AIADMK\u2019s concession to Vanniyars, the BJP\u2019s expansion among newer constituencies and the DMK\u2019s hope to capitalise on those disenchanted with the wooing of newer groups \u2014 will lead to a new churn in the caste politics of Tamil Nadu. </p>"},

{"source": "HindustanTimes", "headline": "Situating India\u2019s manufacturing challenge in the short-term and long-term", "link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/situating-india-s-manufacturing-challenge-in-the-short-term-and-longterm-101615875593027.html", "content": "<p>The Index of Industrial Production (IIP), which is the official tracker of monthly economic activity in mining, manufacturing and electricity generation contracted by 1.6% in January, under-performing estimates by economists polled by Bloomberg of a 1% growth. The Index of Eight Core Industries, which measures the state of economic activity in coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilizers, steel, cement and electricity also grew at a mere 0.1% in January. Both data points are in sharp contrast with some high frequency indicators such as Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) for manufacturing which has been doing very well in the past few months. What is the big picture on the state of manufacturing in the Indian economy? Here are four charts which explain this.</p><p><strong>The post-pandemic recovery in manufacturing is still fragile </strong></p><p>That the economy has recovered after removal of lockdown related restrictions is beyond doubt. The GDP growth figures -- they have improved from a 24.4% and 7.4% contraction in the quarters ending June and September 2020, to 0.4% growth in the December quarter -- are the biggest proof of this. The Gross Value Added (GVA) component of manufacturing has also shown a steady recovery from a 35.9% and 1.5% contraction in the June and September 2020 quarters to a 1.6% growth in the quarter ending December 2020.</p><p>However, a look at the monthly IIP and core sector growth numbers tells a different story. While there was an uninterrupted recovery from May to September 2020 \u2013 India imposed a lockdown beginning March 25, 2020 and started gradually removing restrictions from May onwards \u2013 its nature has become erratic after that. For example, the manufacturing component of IIP slipped into contraction zone in November 2020, recovered in December and has gone back into contraction mode in January . Similarly, the Index of Eight Core Industries slipped back into contraction zone in October and November 2020. While it re-entered positive growth territory in December 2020, it lost growth momentum in January.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The picture is even more bleak if the base effect is filtered out </strong></p><p>The Indian economy was facing a protracted slowdown even before the pandemic threw economic activity into disarray. This also means that there is a favourable base effect at play for calculating post-pandemic annual growth rates for most economic indicators. A comparison of annual growth in IIP\u2019s manufacturing component and Eight Core Industries in January shows this clearly. Growth rate of both these indicators has been lower since January 2019 than it used to be earlier. The January contraction in IIP\u2019s manufacturing component and marginal growth in Eight Core Industries has come on the back of already low growth rate in January 2019 and January 2020. The absolute value of IIP\u2019s manufacturing component in January was actually lower than even the January 2019 value.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Manufacturing has consistently lost momentum over the past decade </strong></p><p>The predicament of India\u2019s manufacturing sector is not a story of a slowdown in the last couple of years. A long-term analysis of Gross Value Added (GVA) data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy\u2019s (CMIE) database shows that there has been a long-term deceleration in manufacturing growth in the last decade. A comparison of compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in manufacturing GVA across decades shows this. While manufacturing growth gained momentum in the 1990s and 2000s, the CAGR went down between 2011-12 and 2019-20. The current financial year (2020-21) has been excluded to filter out the pandemic\u2019s disruption. While overall economic growth itself lost momentum between 2011-12 and 2019-20, manufacturing lost more in growth than the overall economy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is to be done? </strong></p><p>India\u2019s manufacturing challenge has a short-term and long-term aspect to it. While it is crucial that the current manufacturing activity picks up on a sustained basis and at least attains pre-pandemic levels, any sense of complacency based on the improvement in numbers from March onwards -- largely due to a favourable base effect -- risks side-tracking the economy\u2019s attention from the larger challenge of overcoming what is clearly a prolonged slowdown in Indian manufacturing. A rejuvenation of India\u2019s manufacturing sector growth will take both demand- and supply-side interventions.</p><p>The demand-side aspect of it is more pertinent in dealing with the short-term challenge. One of the biggest reasons for a disappointing growth in January IIP was poor performance of the consumer goods sector, which contracted 4.2% on an annual basis. When read with latest findings (January) from the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS) -- the CCS is conducted in India\u2019s 13 major cities, and measures perception on general economic situation as well as spending on non-essential items \u2013 which continued to be in negative territory, it is clear that industrial production is facing a demand constraint. The growth in previous months can be attributed to what many economists have described as being caused by pent-up demand. Unless this changes, a sustained recovery will not materialise.</p><p><br></p><p>To be sure, demand is not the only challenge facing India\u2019s manufacturing. This year\u2019s Economic Survey compared the export performance of India and Bangladesh and concluded that one reason why Bangladesh has done better on this front is that it has specialised in exporting goods where it has a comparative advantage. Given the fact that both India and Bangladesh are labour abundant countries, their comparative advantage would lie in exporting labour intensive goods. \u201cWhile Bangladesh\u2019s export basket is in keeping with this economic reality \u2014 textiles, footwear and apparel constitute 90% of its exports \u2014 around 40% of India\u2019s exports are capital or technology intensive\u201d, the Survey found out.</p><p>Given the fact that India\u2019s domestic market is much bigger than Bangladesh\u2019s -- India\u2019s GDP in current US dollars was $2.9 trillion in 2019 compared to Bangladesh\u2019s $302.6 billion \u2013 a revival in mass demand for labour intensive products could generate the necessary tailwinds for export competitiveness as well. This is what former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan suggested when he made a case for a \u2018Make for India\u2019 instead of \u2018Make in India\u2019.</p>"},

However, you just need to have a heart to heart discussion with your parents about how the vaccination is an important step to stop the pandemic and how it will help build immunity against the disease. If you research your options and make an informed, responsible choice, you will be doing a service to yourself and to those around you... I took my mother to our family doctor, so that she could clear all her doubts regarding the vaccination. A consultation with a healthcare professional helped her become more comfortable and confident, with regards to getting the vaccination,\u201d says Sanjay Kataria, a Delhi University student. </p><p>Youngsters have even made groups on various platforms to have conversations via text messages and video calls, about the vaccine. \u201cI\u2019ve made a WhatsApp group with my grandparents where we share all news and articles related to the vaccines and the pandemic. I think that has helped make each one of us aware about the various ways in which this pandemic is to be tackled. There are many times my grandmother video calls me to ask me about the new Covid-19 strains or the efficacy of different vaccines. We also talk about our fears and hesitation. I think an informed dialogue is always the way forward,\u201d says Sangarika Tripathi, a Delhi-based IT professional who has scheduled an appointment to take her grandparents to get vaccinated. </p><p><b>Author tweets <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fizzybuddha?lang=en\" title=\"twitter.com\">@FizzyBuddha</a></b></p><p><b>Follow more stories on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HTcity\" title=\"www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/htlifeandstyle\" title=\"twitter.com\">Twitter</a></b></p>"},

Sometimes they outgrow each other. It has been 9 years since my relationship with my husband Aqeel changed its status as a couple to just friends and to term it simply would be to state that we are 'Happily Separated',\" she said. The couple tied the knot in February 1999 and share two children, Azaan and Fizaa. Talking about the kids, Farah said, \"We will always be best friends to each other and parents to our wonderful children Azaan and Fizaa who love us both equally yet accept that we cannot be a couple any longer.\"</p><p>\"This was a mutual decision we took together involving two adults and there wasn\u2019t any third person involved. The reason we are announcing it publicly now, is so that the ones who know us accept our situation gracefully and always wish well for both of us especially because we hold no animosity of any kind towards one another and will always be there for each other. Aqeel is and will always be my family as I will be his. We hope that all our well wishers will accept our decision maturely and not judge us for it. It\u2019s important to be happy and we all, Aqeel and I including our children and families most definitely are. That\u2019s all that matters.

The study, a collaboration between KU Leuven, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Harvard was published in Neuron.</p><p>An experienced birdwatcher recognises many more details in a bird's plumage than the ordinary person. Thanks to extensive training, he or she can identify specific features in the plumage. This learning process is not only dependent on conscious processes. Previous research has shown that when people are rewarded during the presentation of visual stimuli that are not consciously perceivable, they can still perceive these stimuli afterwards.</p><p>Although this is a known phenomenon, researchers were unsure as to how exactly this unconscious perceptual learning comes about. To find out, Professor Wim Vanduffel and colleagues studied the brains of two rhesus monkeys before and after they were exposed to subconscious visual stimuli.</p><p>The researchers activated part of the reward system at the base of the brain stem, the ventral tegmental area. This includes cells that produce dopamine, a molecule that is also released when you receive a reward.</p><p>\"Dopamine is a crucial messenger molecule of our motor and reward systems, and is extremely important for learning and enjoyment,\" says Vanduffel. Activating the ventral tegmental area released dopamine, among other things. \"By stimulating the brain area directly, we can causally link the activity in that area to perception or complex cognitive behaviour,\" explains Vanduffel.</p><p>While the brain area was activated, the monkeys were shown virtually invisible images of human faces and bodies. Because the images were very blurry and the monkeys had to perform a very different and difficult task at the same time, they could not consciously perceive these images.</p><p>The same process was followed during the control tests, but the brain was not stimulated.</p><p>When the monkeys received subconscious visual stimuli while the ventral tegmental area was stimulated, they knew details about those images afterwards. For example, they knew whether the bodies shown were turned to the left or to the right. This was not the case when there had been no brain stimulation.</p><p>\"Thanks to this experiment, we can demonstrate for the first time a direct causal relationship between this brain region and, as a result, also the likely link between dopamine and the subconscious learning of complex visual stimuli.\"</p><p>The parts in the darker colour regulate, among others, the production of dopamine. Disturbances in this region can lead to Parkinson's disease and other conditions. | (c) Shutterstock</p><p>The researchers also made a brain scan of the animals before and after the test. \"We can see the blood flow in the brain, which gives an indication of which neurons are active. The more blood flow, the more activity,\" explains Vanduffel.</p><p>The scans showed that the task caused activity in the visual cortex of the brain and in areas important for memory. \"With this data, we can zoom in to find out what is happening exactly at a neuronal level in these brain areas, in future experiments.\"</p><p>\"Since Freud's insights in the 20th century, the scientific community has been wondering how subconscious sensations can affect us. Thanks to the present awareness that there is a strong resemblance between humans and monkeys, and new and advanced technologies, we can finally map such processes physiologically.\"</p><p>Disturbances in the dopaminergic system can lead to numerous psychiatric and motor disorders, such as depression, addiction and Parkinson's disease. A better understanding of how this system works, in various forms of learning, is therefore crucial to developing targeted therapies for these conditions.</p><p>\"Parkinson's is a motor disorder and is caused by dopamine-producing neurons dying off. However, current dopamine treatments may produce side effects because they also trigger the entire reward system, which not only reduces motor symptoms but can also lead to addictive behaviour.\" Fundamental research into the functioning of these brain areas will eventually lead to more targeted treatments with fewer side effects.</p><p>This insight is also useful in situations such as trauma, ageing or oncological problems where an increase in brain plasticity, i.e. the ability to change, could be very useful. \"By stimulating areas of the brain that produce dopamine, we could, for example, enable people to regain their speech more quickly or improve their motor skills after an accident or illness. This could even be done through medication, although we are still a long way from that,\" explains Vanduffel.</p><p>Insights about our brain and the conditions under which we and other primates visually shape our world are therefore crucial, because, as Vanduffel concludes: \"you have to know how a car's engine works before you can fix a problem with it.\" </p><p><strong>Follow more stories on </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/htlifeandstyle/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook </strong></a><strong>and Twitter</strong></p>"},

Most tumours are sheathed in a protective \"basement\" membrane -- a thin, pliable film that holds cancer cells in place as they grow and divide. Before spreading to other parts of the body, the cells must breach the basement membrane, a material that itself has been tricky for scientists to characterise.</p><p>Now MIT engineers have probed the basement membrane of breast cancer tumours and found that the seemingly delicate coating is as tough as plastic wrap, yet surprisingly elastic like a party balloon, able to inflate to twice its original size.</p><p>But while a balloon becomes much easier to blow up after some initial effort, the team found that a basement membrane becomes stiffer as it expands.</p><p>This stiff yet elastic quality may help basement membranes control how tumours grow. The fact that the membranes appear to stiffen as they expand suggests that they may restrain a tumour's growth and potential to spread, or metastasise, at least to a certain extent.</p><p>The findings, published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, may open a new route toward preventing tumour metastasis, which is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths.</p><p>\"Now we can think of ways to add new materials or drugs to further enhance this stiffening effect, and increase the toughness of the membrane to prevent cancer cells from breaking through,\" says Ming Guo, a lead author of the study and associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.</p><p>Guo's co-authors include first author Hui Li of Beijing Normal University, Yue Zheng and Shengqiang Cai of the University of California at Santa Diego, and MIT postdoc Yu Long Han.The basement membrane envelopes not only cancerous growths but also healthy tissues and organs. The film -- a fraction of the thickness of a human hair -- serves as a physical support that holds tissues and organs in place and helps to shape their geometry, while also keeping them separate and distinct.</p><p>Guo's group specialises in the study of cell mechanics, with a focus on the behaviour of cancer cells and the processes that drive tumours to metastasize. The researchers had been investigating how these cells interact with their surroundings as they migrate through the body.</p><p>\"A critical question we realised hasn't gotten enough attention is, what about the membrane surrounding tumours?\" Guo says. \"To get out, cells have to break this layer. What is this layer in terms of material properties? Is it something cells have to work really hard to break? That's what motivated us to look into the basement membrane.\"</p><p>To measure the membrane's properties, scientists have employed atomic force microscopy (AFM), using a tiny mechanical probe to gently push on the membrane's surface. The force required to deform the surface can give researchers an idea of a material's resistance or elasticity. But, as the basement membrane is exceedingly thin and tricky to separate from underlying tissue, Guo says it's difficult to know from AFM measurements what the resistance of the membrane is, apart from the tissue underneath.</p><p>Instead, the team used a simple technique, similar to blowing up a balloon, to isolate the membrane and measure its elasticity. They first cultured human breast cancer cells, which naturally secrete proteins to form a membrane around groups of cells known as tumor spheroids. They grew several spheroids of various sizes and inserted a glass microneedle into each tumor. They injected the tumors with fluid at a controlled pressure, causing the membranes to detach from the cells and inflate like a balloon.</p><p>The researchers applied various constant pressures to inflate the membranes until they reached a steady state, or could expand no more, then turned the pressure off.\"It's a very simple experiment that can tell you a few things,\" Guo says. \"One is, when you inject pressure to swell this balloon, it gets much bigger than its original size. And as soon as you release the pressure, it gradually shrinks back, which is a classical behavior of an elastic material, similar to a rubber balloon.\"</p><p>As they inflated each spheroid, the researchers observed that, while a basement membrane's ability to inflate and deflate showed that it was generally elastic like a balloon, the more specific details of this behaviour were surprisingly different.</p><p>To blow up a latex balloon typically requires a good amount of effort and pressure to start up. Once it gets going and starts to inflate a bit, the balloon suddenly becomes much easier to blow up.</p><p>\"Typically, once the radius of a balloon increases by about 38 percent, you don't need to blow any harder - just maintain pressure and the balloon will expand dramatically,\" Guo says. This phenomenon, known as snap-through instability, is seen in balloons made of materials that are linearly elastic, meaning their inherent elasticity, or stiffness, does not change as they deform or inflate.</p><p>But based on their measurements, the researchers found that the basement membrane instead became stiffer, or more resistant as it inflated, indicating that the material is nonlinearly elastic, and able to change its stiffness as it deforms. \"If snap-through instability were to occur, a tumour would become a disaster -- it would just explode,\" Guo says. \"In this case, it doesn't. That indicates to me that the basement membrane provides a control on growth.</p><p>\"The team plans to measure the membrane's properties at different stages of cancer development, as well as its behaviour around healthy tissues and organs. They are also exploring ways to modify the membrane's elasticity to see whether making it stiffer will prevent cancer cells from breaking through.\"We are actively following up on how to modify the mechanics of these membranes, and apply perturbations on breast cancer models, to see if we can delay their invasion or metastasis,\" Guo says. \"This is an analogy to making a stiffer balloon, which we plan to try.\" </p><p><strong>Follow more stories on </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/htlifeandstyle/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/htlifeandstyle\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a></p>"},

The nomination of Ashok Lahiri from the Alipurduar seat and Gorkha Janmukti Morcha turncoat Bishal Lama from Kalchini also triggered a wave of protests in North Bengal with the local leadership hitting the streets.</p><p>Elections to the 294-member West Bengal assembly will be conducted in eight phases between March 27 and April 29. The counting of votes will take place on May 2.</p><p>Here, we take a look at a few of the key constituencies and candidates to feature in the list:</p><p><strong>Dinhata, Cooch Behar</strong></p><p><strong>BJP candidate: Nisith Pramanik</strong></p><p>Lok Sabha MP Nisith Pramanik is contesting the Dinhata assembly constituency as a BJP candidate. The segment comes under his Lok Sabha constituency of Cooch Behar.</p><p>Pramanik had switched over from the TMC to the BJP last year. He is now set to face off against two-time MLA Udayan Guha, who is Trinamool's candidate of choice for the seat.</p><p>The district of Cooch Behar in North Bengal has nine assembly constituencies, of which the BJP announced candidates in seven \u2014 Mekliganj, Mathabhanga, Sitalkuchi, Sitai, Dinhata, Tufanganj, and Coochbehar Uttar. Barring the last, the TMC had won all six assembly segments in the 2016 assembly polls. The Cooch Behar Uttar seat was won by the Forward Bloc.</p><p><strong>Tollyganj, South 24 Parganas</strong></p><p><strong>BJP candidate: Babul Supriyo</strong></p><p>Babul Supriyo, the Union minister of state for environment, forest and climate change, has been nominated from the Tollygunge seat in Kolkata, a seat far away from his Lok Sabha constituency of Asansol in Paschim Bardhaman district.</p><p>He is pitted against senior TMC leader and state minister Aroop Biswas, who has been consistently winning the seat for his party since 2006. However, Supriyo has expressed confidence in his ability to handle both Tollygunge and Asansol. In turn, he has accused Biswas of silencing dissident voices.</p><p><strong>Behala Purba, South 24 Parganas</strong></p><p><strong>BJP candidate: Payel Sarkar</strong></p><p>The Behala Purba (East) constituency is being contested on part of the BJP by Tollywood actor-turned-politician Payel Sarkar, who joined the party a few days back.</p><p>The assembly segment has a bit of interesting history. Sovan Chatterjee, who won the seat for the TMC both in 2016 and 2011 and had been an influential leader in the region over several decades, is the sitting MLA. Before joining the BJP, he was also the mayor of Kolkata Municipal Corporation and a minister in the TMC government.</p><p>However, Chatterjee recently <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/tmc-turncoat-sovan-chatterjee-quits-after-bjp-denies-poll-ticket-101615744379132.html\" target=\"_blank\">quit the party</a> along with his friend Baisakhi Bandopadhyay after both of them were denied tickets by the BJP. In his resignation letter to the party's state president Dilip Ghosh, Chatterjee accused the BJP of humiliating him. The BJP, for its part, said that since the TMC fielded Sovan Chatterjee's estranged wife, Ratna Chatterjee, from the same constituency, the party did not want the former couple to contest against each other.</p><p><strong>Singur, Hooghly</strong></p><p><strong>BJP candidate: Rabindranath Bhattacharya</strong></p><p>In a surprise move, the party nominated Trinamool Congress turncoat and octogenarian sitting MLA of Singur, Rabindranath Bhattacharya. Of late, the BJP has not been nominating such elderly persons as poll candidates.</p><p>Bhattacharya, renowned in the Singur region as \"mastermoshai\" (professor), had been winning the seat for the TMC since 2001. Since he was not offered a ticket this time, the leader switched over to the BJP earlier this month. Bhattacharya, who once played a crucial role in the Singur land movement that put an end to the Left Front's 34-year-regime in the state, is now set to contest against TMC candidate Becharam Manna, a one time ally of his.</p><p>BJP cadres in Singur are not too happy about the party's choice of candidate, however.</p><p>Singur is set to witness an interesting contest in the upcoming polls, with the CPI(M) pitting youth leader Srijan Bhattacharya to take on political heavyweights.</p><p><strong>Tarakeswar, Hooghly</strong></p><p><strong>BJP candidate: Swapan Dasgupta</strong></p><p>Senior journalist and Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta is the BJP's nominee for the Tarakeshwar assembly segment. By fielding columnist Dasgupta and economist Ashok Lahiri in these elections, the BJP has sought to impress the sophisticated 'Bhadralok' community of the eastern state, political observers were quoted as saying, noting that the Bengali intelligentsia refrained from backing the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls despite a large consolidation of Hindu votes around it.</p><p>In both 2016 and 2011, Trinamool's Rachhpal Singh had won the seat with over 97,000 votes.

The former finance and external affairs minister, who served as a senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has turned increasingly critical of the central government \u2014 and over the weekend, he formally joined the Trinamool Congress weeks before the election in West Bengal.</p><p>While it is Sinha\u2019s politics that has been in focus, it was his role in government that had catapulted the former Indian Administrative Service officer turned politician into prominence.</p><p><strong>The Chandra Shekhar years</strong></p><p>Sinha was expecting to become the external affairs minister when the Chandra Shekhar government was formed in November 1990. But Chandra Shekhar tasked him to handle the finance portfolio, ostensibly to manage an impending economic disaster, which would manifest as the Balance of Payment (BoP) crisis.</p><p>The short-lived Chandra Shekhar government was acting in the capacity of a caretaker. Sinha describes, in his book, Confessions of a Swadeshi Reformer: My Years as a Finance Minister, how a senior finance ministry official visited him in Patna during his election campaign for the Lok Sabha seat. The official wanted his signature to mortgage gold to secure a loan of some $400 million from the Bank of England and avert the BoP crisis. India was left with limited foreign exchange reserve barely enough pay for two weeks\u2019 imports. Sinha had approved the move, even as it was a legacy issue that did not develop overnight. That day, he made a promise to overhaul the fundamentals of the economy if he would get a chance. Seven year later, he got the opportunity when he was made the finance minister in the Vajpayee government.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/mamata-offered-to-be-exchanged-for-hostages-yashwant-sinha-on-ic-814-crisis-101615629855127.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>\u2018Mamata wanted to be taken hostage\u2019: Yashwant Sinha\u2019s claim on IC 814 hijack</strong></a></p><p>It was not that Sinha had left the issue unattended during his short stint as the finance minister (1990-91). When he assumed the office, total foreign exchange reserve had dropped to <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>3,142 crore, sufficient only to finance imports for one month, he recollects in his book. He adopted a two pronged strategy\u2014to secure a loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and to prepare a \u201cpath-breaking\u201d budget to mobilise revenue. While the first task was accomplished, the second could not take place as the Chandra Shekhar government could not present its full budget. Even as Sinha claims he was drafting the first reformist Union budget of the country ahead of Manmohan Singh\u2019s reforms, the Congress withdrew its support from the government in early March 1991.</p><p>Sinha, in his first budget, which was not a full budget, diagnosed the disease for the successive finance ministers: \u201cThe room for manoeuvre, to live on borrowed money or time, has been used up completely. The soft options have been exhausted,\u201d he said in his interim budget speech presented on March 4, 1991. As FM, Sinha\u2019s focus at that time was to mobilise additional revenue, improve tax compliance, expenditure control and fiscal consolidation.</p><p>He told the Parliament about the need for a \u201cfiscal correction\u201d in a medium term perspective. \u201cWe are engaged in the formulation of a comprehensive approach which would provide a satisfactory and sustainable solution to these problems. This needs time. I would, therefore, plead with the House to wait until the regular Budget for 1991-92 is presented in May 1991,\u201d he had said on March 4, 1991. But, the task was cut for the next finance minister Manmohan Singh, who took over in June 1991.</p><p><strong>The Vajpayee years </strong></p><p>But Sinha did not lose the opportunity completely. His time came in March 1998, when the Vajpayee made him the Union finance minister.</p><p>Presenting a budget on June 1, 1998, Sinha laid contours of what can be seen as an attempt to address the economic impulses for self-reliance. \u201cThis budget is rooted in Swadeshi which will be unfolded as we go along. But I shall hasten to add that Swadeshi does not mean isolation, Swadeshi means making India strong and self-reliant so that we can compete with the world and win,\u201d Sinha had said that day. Three key objectives of his 1998 budget included ensuring macroeconomic stability, attracting investments and freeing productive energies of the people from unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles, or the ease of compliance.</p><p>Based on these principles Sinha subsequently presented four more budgets in the Parliament \u2014 on February 27, 1999, February 29, 2000, February 28, 2001 and February 28, 2002 \u2014 before he was moved to the external affairs ministry in mid-2002. During these years, Sinha introduced some significant reforms that strengthened the Indian economy. He lowered real interest rates, introduced tax deduction for mortgage interest, helped boost highways development and deregulated telecom and petroleum sectors.</p><p><strong>The infra and housing thrust </strong></p><p>Sinha\u2019s first budget in the Vajpayee government, focused on infrastructure development to boost growth, with a 35% increase in allocations. The budget set a target to construct two million additional houses and provided tax incentives to promote housing construction that included 100% tax deduction for first five years, reintroduction of tax deduction for rents paid and exemption from wealth-tax for commercial complexes.</p><p>\u201cThe National Agenda, identifies housing as a priority area. We will move purposefully to tackle the country\u2019s enormous housing shortage problem through partnership between government, housing finance institutions and the private sector,\u201d he said in his budget speech on June 1, 1998. That year, the budget also put private investment as one of the key growth drivers\u2014removing some of the burdens of the Inspector Raj, doubling foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow in two years and providing for a 90-day, time bound approval to high value FDI proposals.</p><p>Sinha also had to brace for economic impact of India\u2019s nuclear tests at the Pokhran range in Rajasthan desert on May 11 and May 13, 1998. \u201cIn India, we had to contend with the additional challenge of economic sanctions imposed on us after the Pokhran nuclear tests. While we have not remained unaffected by these developments, we have reasons to be satisfied at the way we have withstood the impact of these challenges. Despite the hostile economic environment, our GDP growth in 1998-99 has accelerated to 5.8% compared to 5% last year,\u201d he told Parliament while delivering the budget speech on February 27, 1999.</p><p>He accelerated the pace of economic reforms in the 2000-01 budget with key policy measures such as strengthening the rural economy, nurturing knowledge-based industries (infotech, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals), modernising traditional industries (textiles, leather, agro processing and small scale industries), focusing on infrastructure developments, and establishing a credible framework of fiscal discipline. \u201cWith this, my third budget, I propose to put India on a sustained, equitable and job-creating growth path of 7 to 8% per year in order to banish the scourge of poverty from our land within a decade,\u201d he said in his budget speech on February 29, 2000.</p><p>His next budget (2001-02) brought some structural change, most notable of them was fuel price decontrol, also known as dismantling of the Administered Pricing Mechanism (APM). \u201cIn order to accelerate growth in the Indian economy, we have now to address some of the difficult areas of reform that have not been tackled so far,\u201d he said on February 28, 2001. \u201cA time bound action programme is being prepared for the deregulation of APM by March, 2002. My colleague the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas will be outlining the road map for this separately,\u201d he said in his budget speech. The budget laid out a comprehensive agenda of the second generation economic reforms and deepened tax reforms aimed at providing a modern tax regime.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/west-bengal-assembly-election/yashwant-sinha-joins-tmc-says-attack-on-mamata-was-tipping-point-101615648607939.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Yashwant Sinha joins TMC, says attack on Mamata was \u2018tipping point\u2019</strong></a></p><p>One of Sinha\u2019s major achievements was the introduction of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill in the Parliament in December 2000. \u201cPutting our fiscal house in order must remain our highest priority.

The first, an unbeaten 47-ball 79, came against Rajasthan Royals which helped Mumbai Indians post a daunting 193. With MI losing wickets at regular intervals, Yadav started off slowly before bringing out the sweeps, ramp shots and scoops. By the end of the innings, he had scored 51 runs behind square. The second innings, again an unbeaten 79 (off 43 balls this time) came while chasing against Royal Challengers Bangalore. This was just after Yadav was once again overlooked for a limited-overs series, this time in Australia. Like in the match against the Royals, Mumbai Indians were again in trouble early into the chase but Yadav was more conventional in his shot selection this time, unleashing a flurry of cover drives, flicks and pulls to anchor a memorable win.</p><p>Over the last three seasons, Yadav has been honing his skills, balancing conventional with unconventional, trying to spend as much time at the crease as possible while keeping the scoreboard ticking. He has put in the hard yards, perfecting his batting skills in the nets for three to four hours at a stretch across different locations in Mumbai. He also travelled across country during the off-season before the start of the 2019-20 domestic season as it wasn\u2019t possible the train outdoors in Mumbai during the rainy season and he didn\u2019t want to limit himself to practising indoors at the Mumbai Cricket Association\u2019s Bandra Kurla Complex facility.</p><p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/virender-sehwag-praises-ishan-kishan-for-memorable-debut-knock-in-india-vs-england-2nd-t20i-in-ahmedabad-101615867243195.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>\u2018Maybe he was thinking he\u2019s still playing in IPL\u2019: Virender Sehwag lauds Ishan Kishan on debut knock</strong></a></p><p>Former India batsman Pravin Amre, who was part of the MI set-up last season before moving back to Delhi Capitals as assistant coach for the next IPL, feels Yadav\u2019s hardwork is paying off. \u201cPreviously, while he was dominant in shorter formats, there were still chinks in his armour. But the way he batted in the last IPL, it can be termed as the best of his career. He is a player who can bat at any position\u2014from No 3 to No 6. Not many players can do that.</p><p>\u201cSome players take time to develop and it was the same in Yadav\u2019s case but with experience he learnt, developed his game and has reached this stage,\u201d says Amre under whom Yadav made his Ranji Trophy debut for Mumbai in 2010-11. Vinayak Samant, who coached Mumbai for two seasons (2018-20), says Yadav looked in \u201cgreat shape\u201d when he turned out for the pre-season camp during the 2019-20 season. He started that Ranji Trophy with a bang, scoring a 70-ball 102 in the second innings of the opener against Baroda that Mumbai won by 309 runs. \u201cHe had just returned from a personal training stint in Bangalore and looked in good touch from the first ball he faced. Fitness wise he was up there as well. He works a lot on his game, his fitness during the off-season,\u201d says Samant, who backed Yadav to be the team captain.</p><p>\u201cYou can say that he has knocked down that Indian team door with his performances over the last two-three years. It not easy for a player of his age to be considered for the national side,\u201d adds Samant. Yadav is 30. Samant feels that key to Yadav\u2019s success is his ability to get in a \u201cgood position\u201d to play his shots and then stay \u201cas still as possible\u201d. \u201cHis first instinct is to find the gaps as much as possible and we witnessed that during the IPL. Also, if he has to hit a big shot, say off a slower one, he knows exactly where to position himself to get the maximum from the shot. At the same time, he has a bank of two-three shots that he can play off a particular delivery. You can compare him to someone like AB de Villiers,\u201d says Samant, who feels Yadav is a perfect example of the modern day T20 player who can play according to the situation, \u201cmixing caution with aggression\u201d.</p><p>Amre, who has helped India players like Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer, Dinesh Karthik and Suresh Raina, feels another area where Yadav showed improvement last season was his off-side play. \u201cI felt that if he improved his off-side game, it would add another dimension to his game. No way I tried to change his technique but just brought that awareness, prompting him to play through off-side as well. I felt his approach was to look for runs on the leg side. I just told him to play on the merit of the ball and not just look towards the leg side,\u201d says Amre.</p><p>If one compares Yadav\u2019s big IPL innings from 2019 to 2020, there is a stark difference in how he has accumulated his runs. Of the big knocks in 2019, around 65-75% runs were scored on the on-side. In 2020, especially the two unbeaten knocks of 79, he scored 46% and 57% of his runs on the on-side, a marked difference as pointed out by Amre. His preferred region in the off-side was through covers if the ball is pitched up. If it\u2019s dug short and wide, Yadav now prefers the third-man rather than trying to drag it towards on and lose control. \u201cOur job was to improve him in that aspect. Even if its 10% improvement, it matters a lot. Those performances have brought him into the limelight and on the door of the Indian team,\u201d says Amre.</p><p>Those who know Yadav say talent-wise he was always right up there with the best but lacked consistency. It reflects in his career as well. In 2010-11, at 20, he scored 754 runs in his maiden Ranji season for Mumbai. He then played a crucial role in MI\u2019s success in the 2011 Champions League. After moving to Kolkata Knight Riders, he was given the role of a finisher. While his white-ball career was moving briskly, he struggled to convert starts in Ranji Trophy and even his spot in the Mumbai squad for the longer format was questioned. The occasional spats with teammates didn\u2019t help either. \u201cHe used to speak his mind, was hot-headed as well but as the years passed he has matured a lot and has control over his temper. Mentally he is quite strong and focused on improving his game and fitness,\u201d said a Mumbai player who has known Yadav for a long time.</p><p>That maturity has helped Yadav churn out important knocks for Mumbai and MI. In the last three editions of the IPL, Yadav has scored 512, 424 and 480 runs. Returning to MI has been a blessing in disguise as Yadav was given more responsibility by being asked to bat up the order. At the start of the 2020 IPL, the MI thinktank had asked him to anchor the innings and he managed to deliver. He was delivering for Mumbai as well. This Vijay Hazare Trophy, Yadav scored 332 runs in five matches at a strike rate of 151.59, the highest among players to have aggregated 150-plus runs. Three years of toil has helped Yadav become a consistent multi-format performer, forcing the national selectors to finally pick him for the T20 series against England. Now that he has made his debut, there might be no looking back for Yadav.</p>"},

Twice he repeated the sentence on being asked about the road ahead for his team. Rather than glance at the future, the Spaniard wanted to savour the present.</p><p>An ISL trophy on his CV has been a long time coming for Lobera. The former Barcelona youth coach has been one of the most successful managers in the Indian league; according to Transfermarkt, which tracks football analytics globally, Lobera has accumulated 145 points in 79 matches across two clubs, the highest points per match (1.84) of all coaches in the ISL with a minimum of 25 matches.</p><p>Yet before this season he was without silverware in the league. His three-year stint with FC Goa saw him take the team to the semi-finals in the first season in 2017-18 and the final in the following one. Last year, the one-step-higher trend was going strong as Goa finished the league standings at the top. However, Lobera was sacked before that, leaving some unfinished business for the Spanish coach.</p><p>That business met its end with a new club under a new management in a new season, although ironically at the same venue in which Lobera had scripted many chapters of his success story on Indian soil.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s special for me to win the trophy and the Shield in Goa,\u201d Lobera said in a media interaction on Monday. \u201cI lifted the Shield in a stadium (GMC Stadium, Bambolim) we were training in the last three years, and I lifted the trophy in a stadium (Fatorda Stadium) we were playing in the last three years. Working in Goa for the last three years to winning the trophy now with Mumbai City, it has been very special for me. Our dream finally came true in this amazing season. If someone before the start of the season told me about the possibility of writing history, maybe this is the best possible history.\u201d</p><p>Lobera managed to re-write Mumbai City\u2019s history books in his first season at the helm, and now boasts of an ISL title, an ISL Shield as well as the Super Cup title (with FC Goa in 2019). But more than bagging both trophies on offer this season, the 44-year-old particularly relished overcoming the odds and evolving as a coach while working with the City Football Group (CFG), which added Mumbai City to its large global football presence of 10 clubs in late 2019.</p><p>Being in dialogue with CFG\u2019s team of experts \u201cevery day\u201d, Lobera ensured Mumbai bossed a large part of the season while recruiting 17 new players and imbibing a new style of play despite a short pre-season. The team had a 12-game unbeaten streak, ended joint table-toppers and beat the second-best team this season, ATK Mohun Bagan, in all of their three meetings, including the final.</p><p>\u201cThe last four years in India I have achieved a lot of things. But this season was important for me, not just winning the trophy but enjoying the journey and working with people with a big knowledge about football. In this group you can grow a lot as a coach,\u201d Lobera said.</p><p>In the season of quarantines and bio-bubbles, Lobera had to deal with two of his key personnel going home, isolating again for 14 days after returning and getting back to the job; when defender Mandar Rao Dessai lost his father and goalkeeping coach Juan Maria Cruz lost his mother. \u201cFinally when you achieve this, your thoughts are with these people on how they suffered a lot. When you celebrate yesterday (Sunday) with the entire team, and see the trophy and the Shield with us, this picture will always remain in my head. It\u2019s impossible to forget this,\u201d Lobera said.</p><p>Even as Lobera freezes that image in his mind, CFG has already begun preparing for the next set of objectives. Next year\u2019s AFC Champions League, for which Mumbai City have qualified by topping the league this season, poses a stiffer challenge. And just like it did this season, CFG will look to extend its resources to Mumbai City, like tapping on the experience of one of its clubs that has been on the bigger Asian stage\u2014Japan\u2019s Yokohama F Marinos. \u201cThe challenges of AFC Champions League will be different to the ISL, given the level of teams representing the Asian region,\u201d CFG\u2019s India CEO Damian Willoughby said on Monday. \u201cThere may be an advantage for us as we have teams already in the AFC environment. So, I think we have a good handle on the leagues, the competition, the quality across the different Asian markets. That probably gives us some additional support and help.\u201d</p><p>Willoughby stressed upon building a \u201crobust football pyramid\u201d that enables the club to identify, develop and nurture talented young Indian players. And also treating this season\u2019s success as a starting block. \u201cWe\u2019ll look to compete to try and retain the trophies, which is more difficult because you have a target on your back. We've already been thinking of planning and laying down strategic plans for the upcoming seasons, not just ISL-8 but beyond,\u201d Willoughby said.</p><p>For Lobera, though, those plans can wait for a bit. \u201cAs a coach, now is my moment to enjoy this achievement,\" he said.</p>"},

Kohli did what he does best \u2013 shepherd a chase in a way only he can \u2013 and remained not out having scored 73. Kohli's return to his free-flowing best bodes well for India, and it couldn't have come at a better time.</p><p>A regular feature of Kohli's batting in his career has been the number of times he has remained unbeaten. In fact, in 81 T20I innings, the India captain has remained not out 22 times, which proves just how good he is.</p><p><strong>Also read: </strong><a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/remaining-3-t20is-between-india-and-england-to-be-played-behind-closed-doors-due-to-the-rising-number-of-covid-19-cases-in-gujarat-101615828237578.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Remaining three T20Is between India and England to be played behind closed doors</strong></a></p><p>Virender Sehwag, impressed by the return of this feature of Kohli on Sunday, explained how watching Kohli bat should be a lesson for youngsters like Rishabh Pant and Ishan Kishan. Sehwag pointed out a similarity between Kohli and the great Sachin Tendulkar, to explain his point better, explaining how the former India captain would explain to Sehwag the value of making the most of an inning.</p><p>\" When it's Virat Kohli's days, he ensures he finishes the match and is right there till the end, irrespective of the format he is batting in. This is a special aspect about his batting. Like Ajay (Jadeja) said, Rishabh Pant and Ishan Kishan should learn from Kohli, that when it's your day, just don't get out. That's exactly what Tendulkar used to do,\" Sehwag told Cricbuzz.</p><p>\"He used to tell me 'if today is a good day for you, then play as long as you can, remain not out and score runs' because what kind of day you have tomorrow, whether you'll score runs, is not known. But today you know the way you're playing, the ball is appearing like a football,\" Sehwag added.</p><p>While Kishan did impress with a 28-ball half-century in his first outing in India colours, the youngster lost his wicket, out LBW to Adil Rashid for 56 off 32 balls in the same over where he had smacked consecutive sixes to bring up his fifty.</p><p>As for Pant, the wicketkeeper batsman had raced to 26 off 13 balls with two fours and three sixes before a rush of adrenaline saw him hit Chris Jordan to Jonny Bairstow at long on. Although at that stage, India were nicely motoring along, it would have been a different feeling to close out the match, reckoned Sehwag.</p><p>\"So make the most of it and stay not out because it's important. This holds true for both Pant and Kishan, more so for Pant because when he came out to bat, he had hit a six and a four in that over. Had he rotated the strike, waited for the bad balls, the match could have been over sooner,\" the former India opening batsman said.</p>"},

In each instance, it was the debutant that sparkled with the bat or the ball\u2014sometimes with both\u2014to set the tone of the match.</p><p>Add to the mix Rishabh Pant, who has a newfound spring in his steps and strength in the wrists after a torrid time, and half of that group has graduated from India\u2019s 2016 U-19 World Cup squad that finished runners-up.</p><p>They have travelled vastly different paths to get here.</p><p>Pant was the chosen one and was the first from that group to graduate into the senior side. After a decent IPL 2016, his big hitting prowess earned him an India senior T20I cap in 2017. Sundar proved his mettle at the 2017 IPL and made his debut for India before the end of the year.</p><p>While his peers were making their international debuts, Kishan, who had led India at the U-19 World Cup, was struggling. He had a poor 2016 IPL for Gujarat Lions (42 runs in five matches) and followed it up with another average 2017 season (277 in 11 games).</p><p>And yet, if Mumbai Indians paid <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>6.2 crores in the 2018 IPL auctions, it was because they had seen the spark of Kishan\u2019s talent underneath the struggle.</p><p>A left-handed top order bat who could muscle his way through the bowling, he was the kind of explosive starter that MI needed. A glimpse of it was seen at the 2016 IPL where he scored 61 off 40 balls against Sunrisers Hyderabad. It made Kishan the then third youngest half-centurion in IPL. That same year, Kishan scored 273 runs off 336 balls batting at No. 6 against Delhi (that had players like Pant and Unmukt Chand) in a Ranji Trophy game. His innings was laden with 14 sixes and 21 fours and is the highest-ever score by a Jharkhand player.</p><p>But those performances increasingly looked like flashes in the pan. A youngster who rose through the ranks under Rahul Dravid, was slipping into the \u201cnearly there\u201d zone.</p><p>For MI too, Kishan struggled. His 2018 and 2019 IPL seasons were underwhelming. His flamboyance, went one line of thought, was expressed in his love for bling off the field rather than his performances on the field.</p><p>But MI is a team that believes in keeping its squad together and allowing long ropes for players to develop and come good. For Kishan, MI retaining him for the 2020 season despite his failures in the last two editions was a turning point.</p><p>\u201cI have been working with them (Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard) for the last three years,\u201d Kishan said during the tournament about his progress as a player with MI. \u201cI know how they plan the game. It\u2019s not only about power hitting (but also) how they take the game to the last over or how they put pressure on the bowlers also. At the same time how they rotate the strike. How to keep players confused (about) your next move.\u201d</p><p>But it was not until an injury to his state-mate Saurabh Tiwary that Kishan finally got an opportunity to bring his learnings onto the field. He hammered 516 runs in a 14-game spree, more than any other batsman in the team.</p><p>On Sunday, his perseverance was rewarded with a India cap and the MI impact came up again after he his 32-ball 56.</p><p>\u201cBefore the game, Rohit bhai (Kishan\u2019s captain at MI) said to me to not take any tension,\u201d Kishan said. \u201cJust play freely like you do in the IPL. Even Virat bhai said the same thing when he was batting with me. I kept that in mind. Obviously I was nervous going inside, but I wanted to do well in the national jersey.</p><p>\u201cIt helps when you face bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult (both MI pacers) in the nets. It gives you confidence if you can play your shots against those very fast bowlers in the nets. During the IPL you face quality bowlers from all the countries. (James) Pattinson, (Nathan) Coulter-Nile all these are quality bowlers. When you play them you get used to facing quality pace.\u201d</p><p>Kishan\u2019s explosive style (he hit four sixes and five fours) suits Kohli\u2019s plans of adding more firepower to the Indian batting line-up in T20s. Kishan does not shy away from risks, like the attempted reverse sweep against Adil Rashid that got him out LBW.</p><p>In this, he is different from the others in contention for the opener\u2019s spot in T20s.</p><p>KL Rahul and Sharma were named first-choice openers by Kohli ahead of the series, while Shikhar Dhawan (dropped after the first game) has been marked as the backup. But with Kishan\u2019s entry and Rahul\u2019s back-to-back low scores (1 and 0), the team management may be tempted to play a third opening combination \u2013 Kishan and Sharma (who was rested for the first couple of games) \u2013 in the third T20I on Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s (Kishan) a fearless character. He should continue to back his instincts,\u201d Kohli said after the match. \u201cWe had a conversation out in the middle where he understood and analysed the game very smartly. He knew he was hitting the ball well so he kept taking his chances. But he was calculated. He wasn\u2019t reckless. And that\u2019s what you want to see in youngsters.\u201d</p><p>If Kishan gets another chance, it could mean Rahul sitting out or dropping down the order. Kishan could also be used lower down the order with Sharma and Rahul as openers. Kohli is well known for tweaking team compositions, and this series gives him the perfect platform to find his perfect XI before the 2021 T20 World Cup.</p><p>\u201cAs you play at the highest level, there is no fixed spot for you. Just because I opened in my first game, does not mean that I will play in the same spot in my next match as well. Also, the left-right combination comes (in) to play. So, I am not thinking about that,\u201d Kishan said. \u201cI feel proud that guys with whom I started playing cricket for India are here with me. They inspire me to do better.\u201d</p>"},

He was suspended from the police force in 2004 in connection with the murder and destruction of evidence in the Khwaja Yunus custodial death case. He made repeated attempts to get reinstated between 2005 and 2007, but did not succeed. He resigned from the force, but that too was not accepted. The following year, in 2008, he joined the Shiv Sena. </p><p>Party insiders said his entry into the party was not surprising as Vaze and other police officers who gunned down gangsters in Mumbai were often appreciated by Sena supremo Bal Thackeray. Vaze earlier said he had joined the party with the backing of Sena leader Eknath Shinde, a leader from Thane district. </p><p>\u201cVaze was never an active member of the party.

However, the vaccination drive in the Union territory is on track. Around 77% frontline workers have received vaccine jabs and 20 more centres have been setup across the UT. J&amp;K\u2019s director general family welfare, MCH and immunisation Dr Saleem-ur-Rehman speaks to HT\u2019s Mir Ehsan about the UT\u2019s progress. Excerpts:</p><p><b>How many people have been vaccinated in J&amp;K so far? </b></p><p>Till March 14, a total 3,63,450 people have received their first dose of vaccination, of which 1,00,591 are healthcare workers. Around 76,964 healthcare workers have received the first dose (77%) and 28,732 have also received the second dose (29%) . Of 2,76,559 frontline workers, 1,98,655 received the first doze (72%) and 22,060 the second dose (8%). Among those aged above 60, as many as 81,064 have received the jab (7%). </p><p><b>How is people\u2019s response? Are people reluctant?</b></p><p>So far, we have received a good response from people and in the coming days we will step up the drive. We initially started with 5,000 jabs and on Saturday (March 13) we inoculated 43,000 people. The percentage of second doses administered is also increasing. People can either get their second dose after six, eight or 12 weeks. Most people delay the second dose to bolster their immunity. At present, we are receiving an overwhelming response with many people enquiring about the address of vaccination centres. </p><p><b>How many centres have been established in J&amp;K for vaccination?</b></p><p>We started with 250 vaccination sites that have been increased to 350. At present, we are running 772 sites across the UT. We increased the number of vaccination sites after we started administering the jabs to those above the age of 60. We do not want our senior citizens to face any problem while locating these centres. We have even established centres at far off places in different regions.</p><p>Notably our wastage is far less than the national average. We have set up two control rooms in Jammu and Srinagar, apart from adverse effects post immunisation control rooms at every place. We have not seen any major adverse affect in J&amp;K due to immunisation.</p><p><b>Are people reluctant to get vaccinated?</b></p><p>Whenever any new vaccination drive is started anywhere, initially people are always apprehensive. Here also people were afraid but once we launched this program, senior J&amp;K health officers and heads of medical institutions were first to get vaccination. We also launched a social media campaign. Around 4 lakh people have been vaccinated and not a single case of death has been reported. </p><p><b>Is there a dearth of vaccines?</b></p><p>In the coming days or weeks we will require more vaccines. The government has promised us an adequate stock as the number of people showing up to get vaccinated is increasing by the day. We are prepared to meet any target. We have an adequate supply of vaccines in all districts. The Centre has asked us not to stock any vaccine as an adequate supply will be sent to us.</p><p><b>Will increased vaccination bring down the Covid count? </b></p><p>Yes, it will help bring down the numbers. In J&amp;K, the disease is well under control but people and officials will have to be vigilant, especially about travellers. We should devise a mechanism that will help us prevent the entry of new strains of virus in the UT. So far, our health system and administration has remained successful in bringing down the numbers from what they were around three to four months ago. </p><p><b>Are Covid cases rising in J&amp;K?</b></p><p>At present, we do not have any evidence that suggests that cases are rising in the UT. Even hospitals meant for Covid patients have vacant spaces. We are closely monitoring the data and testing travellers to ensure the new strains do not enter our UT.</p>"},

The report stated that as terminating the pregnancy at this stage would require the mother and child to be kept in intensive care till they were fit for discharge, it would be better to continue the pregnancy to term. </p><p>After perusing the report, the court held that it would go by the observation of the experts, and hence, did not permit the termination of the pregnancy.

It stressed that the offence was not an ordinary act but a crime against the State, and that Khan, while committing the offence, acted like a dreaded and well-trained terrorist who did not deserve any leniency.</p><p>\u201c[The] convict on account of his despicable act has forfeited his right to live. After balancing mitigating circumstances against aggravating circumstances, it is concluded that it a rarest of the rare case where convict deserves maximum sentence provided under the law,\u201d the court said in its order</p><p>\u201cIt is the level of magnitude, decree of brutality, attitude and mindset of wrong doer behind the crime along with other factors which makes it a rarest of the rare case. Protection of society and deterring criminal is a vowed object of law and this is required to be achieved by imprisonment of appropriate sentence. The most appropriate sentence for convict like Ariz Khan @ Junaid @ Anna @ Salim will be death penalty.\u2026,\u201d it added.</p><p>It imposed a fine of <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>11 lakh on Khan, while directing that <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>10 lakh be immediately released to the family of Special Cell officer Sharma, a celebrated officer who succumbed to injuries following the shoot-out on September 19, 2008. It also asked the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) to look at granting more compensation to the family.</p><p>The encounter took place days after serial blasts ripped through the Capital and killed at least 30 people. Acting on anti-terror igence, police stormed into a house in Batla House locality in Jamia Nagar looking for the alleged perpetrators. A bloody gunbattle followed in which two of Sharma\u2019s colleagues were injured and two terrorists killed.</p><p>But the encounter quickly became politicised with activists and some politicians alleging that the people killed were not terrorists but university students. Police also detained several residents, fuelling local discontent. Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said he believed the encounter was fake and in 2012, party leader Salman Khurshid said Congress chief Sonia Gandhi cried after she saw images of the encounter. Teachers and students of Jamia Millia Islamia organised protests and approached the Delhi high court, demanding a judicial probe. The National Human Rights Commission(NHRC) later conducted an inquiry on the direction of the Delhi high court and cleared Delhi Police.</p><p>The court said that Khan indulged in the \u201cabhorrent and brutal act\u201d of firing on a police party without any provocation, and this showed he was \u201cnot only a threat to society but is also an enemy of the State\u201d. It noted that Khan was also involved in blast cases in Delhi, Jaipur, Ahmedabad and Uttar Pradesh in which hundreds of innocent people were killed and injured, and that this demonstrated he \u201ccontinues to be a threat to the society and the nation\u201d.</p><p>On March 8, the court convicted Khan, 35, saying that he and his associates \u201cintentionally\u201d and \u201cknowingly\u201d committed murder of inspector Sharma. It held Khan guilty of murder, attempt to murder, obstructing public servant on duty, causing grievous hurt and non-appearance despite being declared as a proclaimed offender (PO). Khan was pronounced a PO in 2009 and arrested by the police in 2018 after being on the run for nearly a decade.</p><p>The Batla House shoot-out took place days after five serial blasts in Delhi on September 13, 2008. Inspector Sharma of Special Cell got a tip-off about terrorists involved in the blasts hiding at flat No. 108, L-18, Batla House, Jamia Nagar. When Sharma with his raiding team reached the spot, a shoot-out broke out between the police and the alleged terrorists. Two of them \u2014 Mohammad Atif Ameen and Mohammad Sajid \u2014 were killed during the encounter, while Sharma was shot on his shoulder and abdomen. He succumbed to his injuries on February 19, 2008. Two of the terror suspects, Ariz Khan and Shahzad Ahmadm, managed to flee the spot . Ahmad was arrested on Jan 1, 2010, and handed a life sentenced in July 2013, Khan was arrested on February 14, 2018.</p><p>Maya Sharma, wife of MC Sharma, said she wanted to thank the judiciary. \u201cWe have got a huge relief after 13 years. Finally, justice has been delivered after our 13 year-long struggle. The court has done justice to us. Until now, we were in a position of wait and watch,\u201d she told PTI.</p><p>The judge said that there was no evidence on record that Khan during investigation or trial showed any signs of reformation or repentance. \u201cThe convict eluded investigating agencies for almost ten years despite coercive process against him...There is no evidence on record that convict during investigation or trial showed any signs of...repentance,\u201d the court said.</p><p>Advocate MS Khan, Khan\u2019s counsel, said that he would appeal against the judgment in a higher court. He said that it still remains a mystery as to whose bullet hit Sharma, and it is more surprising that on this basis, the court awarded the death sentence. He also contended that the judgment was based on assumptions.</p><p>The BJP welcomed the verdict. \u201cThe people of the country today expect an apology from leaders of Congress and Aam Aadmi Party who all along called Batla House encounter a fake encounter, insulting the martyrdom of policemen killed in the encounter,\u201d Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said in a statement.</p><p>Asked for his reaction on the verdict, Congress\u2019s Digvijaya Singh said, \u201cWhat do I say on that? Judiciary did its work.\u201d</p><p>Retired IPS officer, Karnal Singh, who was the JCP, special cell, Delhi Police at the time of the encounter, said the vedict \u201cvindicates the stand of the special cell\u201d. \u201c(This) shows that the crime branch did an excellent job. The special cell also did an outstanding job in investigating the serial blast case and apprehending the IM terrorists. Of course, during the process, we lost our best inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, who had done many operations against the terrorists. It was a great loss to the Delhi Police.\u201d On questions raised on the shootout, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that we do not have a national consensus on terrorism. People start speaking against the police officers without even verifying the facts...That was unfortunate.\u201d</p><p>Welcoming the verdict, former IPS officer Prakash Singh said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of satisfaction because there was so much of controversy for political reasons. The lesson...is that people should not jump to conclusions and suspect the police version...It\u2019s a good ending and a right message should go to the people who think that they can fire at policemen.\u201d</p>"},

If we include the term of M G Ramachandran, whose political legacy Jayalalithaa inherited, the chief minister\u2019s post was held between the three people for 42 of the last 52 years.</p><p>Karunanidhi\u2019s Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) is now headed by his son <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/elections/tamil-nadu-assembly-election/dmks-mk-stalin-promises-to-act-on-17-lakh-petitions-within-100-days-if-voted-to-power-101615737753490.html\" target=\"_blank\">M K Stalin</a>. Udayanidhi Stalin, Stalin\u2019s son, is among the DMK candidates in the elections. The DMK was formed out of a split on the question of nepotism. Its founder C N Annadurai parted ways with his mentor E V Ramasamy \u201cPeriyar\u201d, who headed the Dravidar Kazhagam, which itself was born of the Justice Party after Periyar decided to marry a young woman, Manimmai and named her as his political successor.</p><p>The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), formed by MGR after he exited the DMK, is, meanwhile, trying to set its own house in order. It is trying to maintain a separate identity of its own without undermining its alliance with India\u2019s current dominant political hegemon, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).</p><p>Beyond these obvious changes, the 2021 elections will also be interesting as far as Tamil Nadu\u2019s long-term political landscape is concerned. An HT analysis underlines at least three interesting trends, which have been developing in the state politics.</p><p><strong>Elections have become close contests</strong></p><p>The AIADMK created history of sorts by retaining power for the second consecutive term in the 2016 assembly elections. Political power alternated between the DMK and the AIADMK since 1984. However, the 2016 elections were among the most closely contested elections -- especially in terms of median victory margins. A median gives the middle value in a distribution. The median victory margin, in terms of vote share, in the 2016 election in Tamil Nadu was 6.6%, the second lowest in Tamil Nadu since 1971, the earliest period for which data is available in the database maintained by the Trivedi Centre for Political Data (TCPD) at Ashoka University. A long-term look at victory margins also suggests that they have been declining in the post 1990 period.</p><p><strong>The two main Dravidian parties had unprecedented support in 2016</strong></p><p>While Tamil Nadu\u2019s politics has been dominated by Dravidian parties, first the DMK and then its offshoot AIADMK for decades, they never had more than two-thirds of vote share between them until 2016. This changed in the 2016 elections, when their combined vote share crossed 72%. The Congress was the leading party in the erstwhile state of Madras. It is only in 1967 that the DMK won an election in the state, which was renamed Tamil Nadu later. Since then the Congress has undergone two phases of decline. The first major decline in its vote share came with the AIADMK contesting its first election in the state in 1977, when the Congress was pushed to the third spot. With members of the Congress and the DMK forming their own parties in the 1990s \u2013 such as the Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) and the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam \u2013 the Congress vote share suffered another big decline in vote share. The left parties \u2013 Communist Party of India (CPI) and Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M), which did not see a decline in vote share with AIADMK\u2019s entry in elections, have also seen their vote share reduce after the formation of many regional parties in the state. The BJP, so far, has been a marginal player in the state\u2019s politics. The fate of all parties except the DMK and AIADMK is largely contingent on their alliance of lack of it with the two major parties.</p><p><strong>Alliance is a tricky business for both the DMK and the AIADMK</strong></p><p>The statistics discussed so far clearly underline the importance of alliances in Tamil Nadu. In a state where median victory margins are around 6% and the two major parties together, even at their peak have never crossed more than three-fourth of the total vote share, alliances matter a lot. However, both the DMK and the AIADMK are extremely cautious and reluctant when it comes to seat sharing. While the DMK has given just 25 assembly constituencies (ACs) to the Congress, its biggest alliance partner in these elections, the AIADMK has offered just 20 ACs to the BJP. A look at past election statistics explains the reluctance on part of the two major parties to offer more ACs to their alliance partners. Both the DMK and the AIADMK perform better against the alliance partners of their opponents than each other. In other words, the probability of a loss is higher in ACs which are given to alliance partners.</p>"},

A banker cannot take away an asset in the case of an education loan because in most cases there is no mortgage, unlike, say, a housing loan,\u201d said Narayanan Ramaswamy, partner and head, education practice, of consulting and auditing firm KPMG.</p><p>\u201cIn an income loss and job loss situation, education loan repayments have taken a back seat against survival. Besides, students have gone for a deferment of their education and many must have dropped out from courses such as engineering, contributing to the surge in non-performing assets,\u201d said K.R. Shyam Sundar, a labour economist and academician.</p><p>Instances of students dropping out of professional degree courses following disruptions in the market, the jobs sector, and the education sector caused by Covid, must have contributed to rising instances of bad loans for the category, Ramaswamy said.</p><p>States facing high levels of loss of income and jobs and with a high density of engineering colleges must have contributed to high NPAs, he said.</p><p>South India contributed around 70% of the total NPAs for education loans, with Tamil Nadu alone registering NPAs of <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>3,490.75 crore out of the total of <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>8,587 crore education loan NPAs till December-end, government data showed. Of the outstanding education loans, 20.3% in Tamil Nadu and 25.76% in Bihar have turned bad. However, Bihar\u2019s burden was much less than Tamil Nadu.</p><p>Centre had offered a moratorium on loan repayments to borrowers, including those who had taken education loans in the first half of 2020. \u201cThis was a good move from the government, but by the end of the period jobs loss in the formal sector had become evident and this must have pushed deferment of education loan payment by many and more so those who dropped out,\u201d Shyam Sundar said.</p>"},

When semal trees are still in bloom, and that their red flowers set alight every surface they fall upon.</p><p>Kiran Bhushi\u2019s second floor apartment lies right under the branches of a gigantic semal, in south Delhi\u2019s Khel Gaon. And this evening the terrace is covered with semal\u2019s pulpy flowers, dropping one after another.</p><p>\u201cThe other day one fell on my friend\u2019s wrist, and she said it hurts,\u201d mutters Ms Bhushi. Wearing a peach-coloured tussar silk sari, she has just returned from work. A sociology professor, she reigns alone in this house. Almost alone, one must say. For her apartment is unofficially shared by Maharani, a neighbourhood cat who often chooses to lounge for long hours in Ms Bhushi\u2019s apartment. Right now the cat is helping herself to her meal bowl in the terrace corner. It is impossible to read Maharani\u2019s mind, but her behaviour suggests that she doesn\u2019t care much for all the semals scattered about her.</p><p>Mr Bhushi remarks that Rajrani, her part-time housekeeper, isn\u2019t exactly fond of semal either. Her reasons are more practical, since she is in charge of cleaning the terrace. Besides, the flowers are slippery and you can fall and break a bone, warns Ms Bhushi. And the tree sheds a tad too many leaves.</p><p>The professor now sits down on one of the three iron chairs arranged around an iron table\u2014all littered with the fallen semals. Maharani too settles nearby. The chairs are green, and remarkably similar to the green metallic chairs of the famous Luxembourg Gardens in Paris, which are actually so iconic that their exact replicas are sold on Amazon. Ms Bhushi has indeed extensively travelled in France, but the fact that her chairs are similar to those of a Paris garden is completely unintentional. \u201cI picked them from a footpath stall in Saket, and painted them pea-green during the lockdown.\u201d</p><p>As the semals continue to fall about her, one naturally wonders if the terrace will still be beautiful once their season ends.</p><p>It will then have beauty of another kind, Ms Bhushi says. The terrace will have more colours\u2014the yellow of the sunflowers, the saffron shade of nasturtiums, the pink of the bougainvillaeas and the white of petunias. \u201cMost white flowers come in summer, and bloom at night, and then my terrace will be full of perfumes. I will sit down here in the darkness and watch moths sitting on these flowers\u2026 Jasmines will be blooming soon, too. Champas will also come.\u201d</p><p>And these semals will then not be missed.</p>"},

The bill said \u201cgovernment\u201d in Delhi will mean the L-G in context of all legislation passed by the city-state\u2019s assembly and made it mandatory for the city government to seek the L-G\u2019s opinion before any executive action.</p><p>\u201cThe said bill will promote harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive, and further define the responsibilities of the elected government and the lieutenant governor, in line with the constitutional scheme of governance of National Capital Territory of Delhi, as interpreted by the Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court,\u201d read a statement of objects and reasons, attached with the draft legislation, attributed to Union home minister Amit Shah.</p><p>Shortly after the bill was introduced, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of seeking to ically curtail the powers of an elected city government.</p><p>\u201cAfter being rejected by people of Delhi (8 seats in assembly, 0 in MCD bypolls), BJP seeks to drastically curtail powers of elected government through a Bill in LS today. Bill is contrary to Constitution Bench judgement. We strongly condemn BJP\u2019s unconstitutional n anti-democracy move,\u201d he said.</p><p>On July 4, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the L-G couldn\u2019t interfere in every decision of the Delhi government and must act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers.</p><p>Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia called the bill unconstitutional and undemocratic. \u201cAfter this bill is implemented, the elected government of Delhi will mean nothing. This is a dangerous amendment,\u201d he told a press conference.</p><p>Delhi holds a unique position in India\u2019s administrative framework. As a Union territory, it is governed by the 1991 Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act that provides for both an elected assembly and an L-G appointed by the Union home ministry. But unlike full states, many important departments such as land, police and personnel appointments don\u2019t come under the purview of the city government and report directly to the L-G. Political conflict for administrative control of the prestigious national capital is decades old but came to a head in 2015, when the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) swept to power and repeatedly clashed with the BJP over transfer and appointment of top bureaucrats. The former also accused the latter of trying to rule the city by proxy.</p><p>In July 2018, the top court ruled the L-G was bound to listen to the city\u2019s elected government and couldn\u2019t act independently, prompting the AAP government to claim victory. All decisions by Delhi\u2019s council of ministers must be communicated to the L-G but his concurrence was not required, the five-judge bench headed by then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra ruled.</p><p>The amendment introduced on Monday decisively tilts the balance of power in favour of the L-G. It bars the Delhi government from making any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the Capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions. Any rule made till this act comes into effect will be void, according to the bill. It further says that the Delhi assembly won\u2019t be able to make rules for regulating, its procedure and the conduct of its business which are inconsistent with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Parliament. According to the Centre, the amendments seek to clarify the expression of government in order to give effect to the interpretation made by the Supreme Court.</p><p>\u201cThe Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 was enacted to supplement the provisions of the Constitution relating to the legislative assembly and a council of ministers for the National Capital Territory of Delhi and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Section 44 of the act deals with conduct of business and there is no structural mechanism provided in the act for effective time bound implementation of said section. Further, there is no clarity as to what proposal or matters are required to be submitted to Lieutenant Governor before issuing order thereon,\u201d the statement of objects and reasons stated.</p><p>\u201cIt further seeks to ensure that the Lieutenant Governor is necessarily granted an opportunity to exercise the power entrusted to him under proviso to clause (4) of article 239AA of the Constitution, in select category of cases and also to make rules in matters which incidentally encroach upon matters falling outside the preview of the legislative assembly,\u201d the statement added.</p><p>The AAP government opposed these provisions. \u201cThe Bill says- 1. For Delhi, \u201cGovt\u201d will mean LG Then what will elected govt do? \u2026 2. All files will go to LG. This is against 4.7.18 Constitution Bench judgement which said that files will not be sent to LG, elected govt will take all decisions and send copy of decision to LG,\u201d Kejriwal said in another tweet. Sisodia said the BJP was trying to dilute elections and electoral mandate by using unconstitutional means to pass undemocratic laws. \u201cThis Bill will stall Delhi\u2019s progress by giving undue powers to the L-G. All the decisions taken by the Delhi Government, for the growth of the city, have seen an intrusion by the L-G. Files regarding the progress of Mohalla Clinics, CCTV installations, free electricity, water and schools have collected dust in the L-G\u2019s office, owing to lack of support from his office,\u201d he said.</p><p>The BJP rejected the charges and welcomed the amendment. \u201cPublic money is being wasted due to which Delhi is in a state of mess. No new development works have been initiated by this government. As Delhi continues to be a Union Territory, the L-G has the ultimate power. The Centre has only defined the powers more clearly,\u201d said BJP and leader of Opposition in the Delhi assembly RS Bidhuri.</p><p>Lawyer Gautam Bhatia argued that the amendment violated the Supreme Court\u2019s 2018 judgment. \u201cMost of the provisions are specifically designed to nix the ongoing enquiry by the Delhi assembly into the 2020 riots...look at the proposed amendment to Section 33, which specifically bars the Delhi assembly from constituting committees to enquire into \u2018the day-to-day affairs of the administration\u2019, and makes it applicable with retrospective effect,\u201d he said on Twitter.</p>"},

The trip is part of a cross-country blitz planned by President Joe Biden and top administration officials to sell the relief package and ensure Democrats get credit for it from voters.</p><p>Harris said in a speech at the Culinary Academy in Las Vegas that she and Biden aim to tell voters that the relief bill is an example of what the government should do.</p><p>\u201cWe have a duty to help each other out, especially in times of need,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is our responsibility when people are suffering. And you do it understanding the dignity of each person and your fellow human being.\u201d</p><p>Since taking office in January, Harris has been under scrutiny as she carves out a role for herself as vice president -- an office with few specific responsibilities that a former occupant, John Nance Garner, once called \u201ca spare tire on the automobile of government.\u201d Gaining important duties will be crucial for Harris, 56, should she choose to run for president again in the future.</p><p>With this week\u2019s trip, Harris is developing a role as a key promoter for the stimulus, the first major legislation Biden signed into law. The White House views the plan as central to defeating the pandemic and engineering a strong economic recovery. Much of Harris\u2019s focus has been on how the rescue package could help small businesses and women in the workforce.</p><p>A White House official downplayed the notion that the trip is intended to build Harris\u2019s profile. The vice president sees it as a chance to encourage Americans to get a Covid-19 vaccine, the official said, especially people of color who are more likely to be hesitant.</p><p>The official asked not to be identified discussing Harris\u2019s plans ahead of the trip.</p><p>Before stopping at the Culinary Academy, Harris visited a mass vaccination site in Las Vegas. \u201cYou all are the heroes of this moment,\u201d she said there. \u201cYou guys are saving lives.\u201d</p><p>The Culinary Workers Union, a major labor and political force in the state, is one of the groups that operates the academy.</p><p>On Tuesday, Harris is scheduled to visit a vaccination clinic in Denver and meet with small business owners to discuss aid that will flow to them under the stimulus law, the official said.</p><p><strong>Travel Limitations</strong></p><p>Harris is eager to travel the country, the official said. The Biden White House has thus far limited official trips because of the ongoing pandemic. One of the vice president\u2019s goals is to hear directly from people about how their lives were affected, and explain how various provisions of the rescue plan may help.</p><p>\u201cAmericans will see what we did here. What you did, Mr. President,\u201d Harris said during a Rose Garden ceremony last week celebrating the bill. \u201cAnd they will feel the impact of this bill for generations to come.\u201d</p><p>The trip is part of what the White House is calling the \u201cHelp is Here\u201d tour to tout the stimulus plan, which polls show is supported by majorities of Americans, even though it passed the House and Senate with no votes from Republicans.</p><p>\u201cThe tour will make clear that help is here and we are on the path toward crushing the virus and rebuilding our economy,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Monday at a briefing.</p><p>Harris will also join Biden during a stop in Georgia on Friday. The president plans his own trip earlier in the week to Pennsylvania, a state that was key to his victory in November. Doug Emhoff, Harris\u2019s husband, is accompanying her to Las Vegas and Denver and will also visit Albuquerque, New Mexico, in his first solo trip as second gentleman.</p><p>Harris is expected to do more traveling in the coming weeks, the White House official said.</p><p><strong>Shaping Her Role</strong></p><p>After more than 50 days in office, her role in the Biden administration hasn\u2019t yet been fully shaped.</p><p>Biden has included Harris in nearly all of his public appearances, and has said she\u2019s a full partner in his decision making. She\u2019s had solo calls with foreign presidents and prime ministers, including the leaders of France and Israel. But she\u2019s not yet been given a specific policy portfolio, as some of her modern predecessors have had.</p><p>In his eight years as Barack Obama\u2019s vice president, Biden put his own stamp on the job. One of his first tasks was to oversee implementation of the 2009 Recovery Act that followed the Great Recession, and was passed a month into Obama\u2019s term. He was dubbed \u201cSheriff Joe\u201d for efforts to enforce against waste, fraud and abuse.</p><p>Biden appeared to acknowledge both the perks and pitfalls that come with those type of vice presidential responsibilities. He recalled in the Rose Garden last week the \u201cdubious distinction\u201d of implementing the law, an apparent recognition that he would have been blamed for any major problems.</p><p>But he also suggested being tapped for such a job is a vote of confidence for the second in command.</p><p>\u201cI know, from experience, when the president turned to me -- like I haven\u2019t done to the vice president yet -- and said \u2018take care of it, you take care of implementing the plan,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut she can do it.\u201d</p><p>On Monday, Biden named Gene Sperling, a former White House economic adviser under Obama and President Bill Clinton, to oversee implementation of his stimulus.</p>"},

The entire underpass project will be completed by end of June 2021.</p><p>The delay comes as multiple agencies work out of sync and will mean people coming from Noida and East Delhi via this route \u2013 one of the arterial connections \u2013 have little option but to spend upwards of 40 minutes (or more during peak hours) till the diversions remain in place in one of the Capital\u2019s busiest and most important intersections.</p><p>A pile-up of vehicles waiting to turn right also eats into the space for those going straight to Lajpat Nagar. This route is often used by ambulances ferrying passengers to critical care facilities such as AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital.</p><p>The Delhi traffic police, on the request of the PWD, had introduced a new diversion plan for the intersection from March 3, following which vehicles coming from Noida and Sarai Kale Khan now have to take a compulsory left turn on Mathura Road towards New Friends Colony traffic signal, located 600 metres away from the intersection, and then make a U-turn. Commuters can then take a left turn to go towards Lajpat Nagar on the Ring Road or go straight towards Nizamuddin or Bhogal. Earlier, vehicles could directly make a right turn towards Nizamuddin or go straight on the Ring Road at the Ashram intersection.</p><p>Commuters complained that because of the main intersection being completely closed, travel time on the stretch has increased by at least 40 minutes.</p><p>PWD officials, however, said the work on the intersection was \u201ccrucial and complex\u201d and required restriction of traffic in order to meet the June deadline for completion of the 750-metre underpass connecting Nizamuddin Railway Bridge and the CSIR Apartments on Mathura Road. The project has already missed one deadline in December last year and is on course to miss its March deadline as well.</p><p>\u201cWe will take at least one-and-a-half months more to finish construction work on the central portion of the underpass, which falls right at the junction on the Ring Road, below the flyover. The nature of work here is complex because there are a number of utilities, such as water pipelines, that need to be shifted, beside deep digging work being carried out. The traffic on this portion has been diverted towards New Friends Colony so that we get more space to finish this segment of work as soon as possible,\u201d a PWD official said.</p><p>Ashram, which is one of the busiest stretches in the Capital, sees over 350,000 vehicles passing every day during peak rush hours of morning and evening. The traffic situation, which was already chaotic before the new plan was introduced, has now got worse, especially for emergency vehicles moving from nearby hospitals. Currently, vehicular movement is blocked at the intersection, below the Ashram flyover, traffic police officers said.</p><p>\u201cBecause of the ongoing construction work, the traffic movement in Ashram has been hugely impacted. Hence, it is important that work here be completed fast so that commuters get some respite and space can be cleared out before PWD begins work on the extension of the flyover on the Ring Road,\u201d a senior Delhi traffic police official said.</p><p>PWD officials justified the \u201ccomplete blockade\u201d as much needed to meet the June deadline. UTTIPEC \u2014 the apex body for approving infrastructure projects \u2014 had approved the underpass project in January 2016, which was to be completed by March 2018. The project finally got the nod of the expenditure finance committee of the Delhi government in 2018. On December 24, 2019, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal laid the foundation stone with a December 2020 deadline. This was extended to March 2021, and further till June.</p><p>\u201cAshram crossing is now a perennial choke point. For the last five-six years, I have been seeing some sort of construction activity here. Passing through this stretch has now become a nightmare. I now have to spend at least 30-40 minutes extra to reach my home from Noida due to the new traffic plan,\u201d Preeti Pandey, a resident of Bhogal, said.</p><p>Subhash Chand, head of traffic engineering and safety division at the Central Road Research Institute, said traffic jams on the stretch is a result of poor site management by the construction agencies. \u201cEven without closing the entire intersection, you can facilitate smooth traffic flow and also complete your work within the deadline. This can happen with efficient site management, which the PWD is ignoring. You are supposed to ensure that there are ample signage to warn commuters of the diversion. You also need to ease the traffic into the construction site, which is also not happening,\u201d Chand said.</p>"},

However, the dip in numbers is likely due to fewer tests conducted on Sunday, reported a day later in Monday\u2019s health bulletin. The city had conducted just over 62,000 tests for Covid-19 on Sunday, compared to an average of over 71,000 tests conducted over the four days before that when the city had seen over 400 cases. </p><p>To be sure, testing numbers usually see a dip on account of the weekend</p><p>This puts the positivity rate \u2013 proportion of samples that return positive among the total samples tested \u2013 at 0.59%. The increase in positivity rate is indicative of increasing spread of the infection. However, experts believe that the spread is still under control till a positivity rate of 5% or less in maintained. The positivity rate in Delhi has been on the rise since mid-February, however, still remains below 1%. </p><p>The average positivity rate over seven days stood at 0.56% as compared to 0.43% the week before and 0.36% before that. </p><p>\u201cThe positivity rate in Delhi was over 15% at one time and the WHO (World Health Organization) says that it should be below 5%. The positivity rate in Delhi has been below 5% for a few months now and below 1% for nearly 2.5 months. In comparison, the positivity rate in Maharashtra is 16.46%, Kerala 3.54%, Punjab 4.81%, and Gujarat 1.78%. This means that the positivity rate in Gujarat is three times that of Delhi, Punjab six time, Kerala seven times, and Maharashtra thirty times,\u201d said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. </p><p>He added, \u201cTill the positivity rate does not cross 1%, the infection is well control. The numbers are fluctuating a little. But, we are alert. We have increased the number of tests to over 70 thousand. We are taking all precaution.\u201d </p><p>The minister also said that people need to keep following all precautions, even during festivals such as the upcoming Holi, as the infection is likely to happen in waves. \u201cIt does not look like Covid-19 will just come to an end; it is likely to keep coming back. What we have learnt so far is that wearing masks is the best way to prevent the infection. Even those who have taken the vaccine should keep wearing masks.\u201d Play dry Holi, he suggested. </p><p>Experts said that one of the major cause of the increase in the infection is the complacency in following norms by the people after the infections went down. \u201cPeople are going to markets and marriages. They are hardly interested in putting on the masks. This is because the number of cases has gone down, many think it is just like the flu, and others think that the vaccine will protect. Truth is, Covid-19 is not really like flu as most people have immune response ready for the common viral infection. Covid is new and not everyone has immunity to it. Vaccinating enough number of people will also take time,\u201d said a senior pulmonologist from Safdarjung hospital, on condition of anonymity. </p><p>On Monday, over 21 thousand people over the age of 60 years received their first shot against Covid-19 and 3,429 people between the ages of 45 years and 59 years with comorbidities did, according to government data. </p><p>The number of hospitalisations are also on the rise. There were 607 Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment in various city hospitals as on Sunday night as compared to 489 at the beginning of the month. </p><p>\u201cThere were very few admissions for nearly fifteen days, however, the number of admissions have started increasing over the last three to four days. Hopefully, the surge would not be like the one we had seen in November because many people have already been exposed to the infection and still others are getting vaccinated. There is a need to strictly enforce masking like the government was doing previously,\u201d said Dr Rajesh Chawala, consulting pulmonologist at Indraprastha Apollo hospital. </p>"},

Terming these as \u201crare\u201d instances, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said fake reports showing results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are being presented at the airport. There is no mechanism to track the veracity of RT-PCR test results. </p><p>In November, CSMIA issued guidelines stating domestic passengers from Delhi, Gujarat, Goa, and Rajasthan are required to provide a negative RT-PCR test report undertaken within 72 hours prior to travel. Otherwise, they must undergo the test at the airport on arrival at their own cost. Kerala was added to the list in February. There is a team dedicated to conducting checks at CSMIA before passengers enter arrival halls. However, it is not possible for officials to cross-check the authenticity of each passenger\u2019s report. According to BMC, some are presenting fake test certificates at the airport. </p><p>\u201cWe got to know that some passengers take a Covid-19 negative report from a relative. Then with the help of Photoshop, they change the dates, names and PAN numbers. Within five minutes, they are able to create fake RT-PCR reports,\u201d said a BMC official, requesting anonymity. </p><p>Last week, BMC registered a first information report against a family based in Khar, who had presented a Covid-negative report that was exposed as fake when the test result with the laboratory showed as positive. \u201cIn the event of suspicion of a fraudulent report, BMC officials on ground at the airport are alerted to the incident for further action,\u201d said a spokesperson from the airport. </p><p>Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasu said, \u201cI don\u2019t overrule that domestic passengers aren\u2019t submitting fake test reports but such instances are rare.\u201d </p><p>Another tactic used by passengers from the five restricted states is reportedly to enter Mumbai via other neighbouring states. For instance, BMC noted some passengers coming from Goa had taken a flight to Bengaluru and then flown to Mumbai. \u201cIn that way, they skip screening at the airport as passengers from Bengaluru don\u2019t have to show RT-PCR reports. If a passenger doesn\u2019t reveal their travel history, it is not possible to cross check it,\u201d said the BMC official. </p><p>\u201cTravelling from other states is one of the contributing factors to the rise of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai. To control the possible spread of the virus, we are checking test reports,\u201d said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. He added that if the public continued to flout rules, more stringent measures may have to be imposed. </p><p>Velrasu said there is no accessible government database against which the veracity of Covid-19 reports may be checked live. \u201cIf people are showing reports from Maharashtra, then through the bar code, we can still verify the authenticity. But if passengers submit fake reports from other states, there is no way to check those,\u201d he said. </p><p>The regular Covid-19 test is available at a minimum cost of <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>850 at CSMIA. Results are delivered in eight to -24 hours. An express test is available at <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>4,500, which delivers results in 13 minutes.

Borivli (West) recorded 536 cases and a growth rate of 0.42%. Ghatkopar recorded 510 cases and a growth rate of 0.44%. </p><p>Highest growth rate does not correspond with most reported cases since for some wards, the base bases (total number of cases reported up to March 6) was lower, said civic authorities. </p><p>A senior civic official said there could be multiple reasons why a ward has more cases but a slower growth rate. \u201cSome areas have more hospitals in their jurisdiction. A ward close to the international airport, which is quarantining international passengers, is likely to record more cases. We also found certain clusters where higher number of cases were detected together.\u201d </p><p>Civic officials attributed the growing number of cases to a number of factors, including resumption of local train services for the general public and citizens not following social distancing norms. \u201cSince the resumption of local trains for everyone, we have seen a spike in the number of new cases. We are recording maximum Covid-19 cases from high-rise buildings, which are turning into superspreaders. People are attending marriages, family functions without wearing masks,\u201d said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC. </p><p>Experts from the state\u2019s Covid-19 task force also pointed out more tests were being conducted. \u201cWe are testing about 20,000-22,000 people each day and that\u2019s why the number is high. However, the test positivity rate is alarming. Also, patients are now coming in with gastrointestinal symptoms. Before they realise they have Covid-19, they have spread it to the rest of the family which is also adding to the caseload,\u201d said Dr Rahul Pandit, a member of the task force. </p><p>Dr Rahul Tambe, senior consultant, internal medicine and infectious diseases, Nanavati Hospital, emphasised that it is essential for the public to wear masks, wash hands regularly and observe social distancing. \u201cVaccination alone can\u2019t eliminate the risks of infection without strict adherence to basic preventive measures,\u201d he said. </p><p>BMC officials said samples from Covid hotspots are being sent for gene sequencing to see if any new variant of Covid-19 has developed in areas like Amravati, where the infection appears to be spreading at a faster rate. \u201cWe are sending samples to National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune from hotspots for genome sequencing to find any possible mutation of the virus. Earlier, we were sending samples only from Seven Hills Hospital, but are now selecting samples from wards with more cases,\u201d said Kakani. </p><p>While at this time last year more cases of Covid-19 were being reported from slums, BMC said last week that 90% of the cases reported in January and February were from wealthier, residential buildings. Ward officers have increased testing in areas with more cases of Covid-19 and all high-risk contacts of Covid-positive patients must be tested on the seventh day. \u201cThe sero survey also showed that antibodies were fewer amongst those in high-rises as against those from the slums,\u201d said Dr Pandit. </p><p>As of March 13, the most active cases are in R-Central ward, (Borivli; 947 cases); followed by K-West, which covers Andheri (West) (918 cases); R-South, which covers Kandivli (West) (816 cases); K-East, which covers Andheri (East) (799 cases); and P-North, which covers Malad (West) (798 cases). The fewest active cases of Covid-19 cases are in B ward (Dongri and Mohammad Ali Road; 94 cases). </p><p>Meanwhile on Monday, 44,683 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Mumbai, of which 39,505 received the first dose and 5,178 received the second dose. 30,298 beneficiaries were senior citizens and 4,500 were citizens aged above 45 years who also have comorbidities.

The suggestion was made while hearing a petition filed by some persons who claimed that though they had given up their homes for redevelopment in 2015, they were yet to get new homes as construction of the building by the developer was stuck at the plinth level. In light of many such petitions coming before the HC regularly, the bench asked the state and BMC to file their replies on the feasibility of setting up panel of developers. </p><p>A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the petition filed by 37 members of a society, was informed by advocate MA Khan that all the petitioners were tenants of the civic authority, as the land of the tenement they lived in belonged to BMC. Khan submitted that in 2015 the members had agreed to a redevelopment proposal and vacated the building on the assurance that once the new building was ready, they would get new homes. </p><p>However, as work on the new building was stuck at the plinth level, they were left without a roof over their heads. In view of this, they approached the HC for directions to the developer to complete the construction of the building as soon as possible. </p><p>After hearing the submission, the bench noted that there was a tendency of developers who were not competent enough to undertake such projects or hand over projects to others after securing them, as a result of which people were rendered homeless. </p><p>The court then observed, \u201cWe may also take judicial notice of the fact that a large number of litigants are knocking the doors of this court concerning projects, in which the developers have failed to fulfil their obligations to complete the construction for long years, either of slums scheme or such other redevelopment. This has created an alarming situation, to the effect that a large number of citizens are homeless and are made to suffer at the hands of such developers.\u201d </p><p>The court suggested that the state government ponder over the issue as to whether it was the need of the time that statutory authorities maintain a panel of registered developers, whose competence on all fronts to execute projects was tested by either the government or other statutory authorities and who could be entrusted with the work of development/re-development. This, the court said, would assure the citizens that construction, once undertaken, was completed in a time-bound manner. </p><p>After making the observations, the court directed the state government and municipal authority to file an affidavit on the suggestion canvassed by the court, and also asked the advocate general to appear in the matter in the next hearing on March 23.</p>"},

Another seven fires were also reported this year from the vicinity of Film City, whose green cover is contiguous with that of Aarey and Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP). Meanwhile, within SGNP, there have been only two forest fires during the same period. This, according to residents and environmentalists, highlights the need for better fire management and conservation practices within Aarey, where over 600 acres of land have been declared as reserved forest under Section 4 of the Indian Forest Act, 1927. </p><p>On March 14, a Hindustan Times team arrived at the site of one such forest fire near Unit No. 16 on Aarey Dairy road. Firefighters attributed the blaze to \u201chuman activity\u201d and estimated that the affected area to be about 1000sqft. Nikhil Wede, a resident of Aarey Colony who first reported the fire, added that such incidents have become increasingly commonplace in the last two months. </p><p>Harish Shetty, deputy fire officer, said, \u201cThe reason behind more forest fires in Aarey, compared to SGNP, is more human presence. In SGNP, movement of people is restricted and there is proper fire management strategy in place. In Aarey it is the opposite. Some tourists must have left behind a burning cigarette or beedi. It happens often.\u201d </p><p>G Mallikarjuna, chief conservator of forests, SGNP, who said that every fire season (February to May), a dedicated fire management plan for SGNP and Tungareshwar National Park is put into play. \u201cThis includes creating fire lines in fire prone areas. We also have four dedicated fire trucks for SGNP and two for Tungareshwar on standby. There is also a team of 20 to 25 firewatchers.\u201d </p><p>A senior official in the forest department said, \u201cEven the land that has been declared forest is still with the dairy department, who do not have a fire management plan.\u201d </p><p>NV Rathod, Aarey Milk Colony CEO, confirmed the dairy department does not have an organised fire response mechanism in place at the moment. </p><p>D Stalin, director of NGO Vanashakti, said these repeated fires are particularly alarming when viewed in context of the state government\u2019s decision to notify more areas of Aarey colony as reserved forest. \u201cOnly about 329 hectares have so far been notified under the Indian Forest Act. A ground truthing exercise is yet to be conducted to identify and bring more areas under protection,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cThere have been several instances where smaller fires have been put out by residents and volunteers with the Save Aarey movement,\u201d said Sanjeev Valsan, a pro-Aarey campaigner who has been tracking forest fires in the area since December 2018. \u201cWe need a dedicated investigation into whether these fires are arson or not. At the very least, we need a dedicated fire station within Aarey so that damage can be curbed.\u201d </p>"},

The matter has been posted for further hearing on March 22. </p><p>Usmani, former student leader of Aligarh Muslim University, was booked by the police based on a letter by Pradeep Gawade, regional secretary of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

He added that it could be construed from the wordings of the speech that he intended to send the message that everyone should join and work together, and in that case no offence was made out against Usmani. </p><p>He also added that as per the assurance in the previous hearing, Usmani had attended the police station as per HC\u2019s directions and hence the protection from coercive action should continue. </p><p>However, advocate Aniket Nikam, who was allowed to intervene on behalf of Gawade, opposed the petition and said young minds or even strong minds would get influenced by the manner in which the speech was made, and hence the petition should not be entertained. </p><p>Additional public prosecutor JP Yagnik, for the state, informed the court that the police was not willing to extend the assurance of no coercive action as Usmani had been speaking to the media about the complaint against him. </p><p>After hearing the submissions, the court noted that it would have to read the speech by Usmani in its entirety to ascertain his intent while saying \u201cdon\u2019t trust Indian judiciary, parliament...and I say we are in a state of war...\u201d and stated that the court was open to criticism. </p><p>The court further asked Yagnik whether Usmani had cooperated as per previous directions.

Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar or water resources minister Jayant Patil may be considered as his replacement.\u201dThere is an impression among NCP top brass that Deshmukh has not been able to handle the home department effectively,\u201d said a senior NCP minister. </p><p>Besides, the state is likely to make an attempt to distance itself from the Vaze issue, pointing at it as a misdeed of a few officials, the insiders said. According to a senior NCP leader, Pawar is said to have expressed his displeasure over the attempt made by chief minister and home department to shield controversial police officer even though there were indications that he could be involved in some way. The NCP chief later held a meeting with senior ministers, including Ajit Pawar, Jayant Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Nawab Malik and Jitendra Awhad. \u201cPutting a full stop to reports of action against Deshmukh, Pawar said the party would wait till completion of probe by the anti-terrorism squad. He said that we should not stand by anybody found guilty,\u201d said a senior minister, who was part of the meeting.</p><p>The party leadership clarified that immediate action against Deshmukh was not necessary, but officers in the Mumbai Police force should be held responsible. \u201cThere is larger perception within the ruling parties that Deshmukh could not handle the department. Immediate action is unlikely. In fact, he was asked by Pawarsaheb to apprise the meeting about the current status of the case,\u201d said an NCP insider</p><p>Jayant Patil, who is also Maharashtra NCP chief, said, \u201cDeshmukh has been doing his job properly\u2026All the three ruling parties are of the view that if someone has committed a mistake, he should he held responsible and the responsibility be fixed. No one in the government is trying to shield anyone.\u201d</p><p>He also said that the ATS is still investigating the Mansukh Hiran\u2019s death and the facts will come out before everyone. \u201cIf Antilia bomb scare would have remained with the ATS, facts would have come out before the people. They were probing in the right direction. Irrespective of the outcome, action will be taken,\u201d the water resources minister said.</p><p>\u201cThe party leadership is said to have told its leaders in the state that they are concerned about how the controversy has hurt the image of the MVA. Patole, in his meeting with the CM, has conveyed it to the latter,\u201d said a Congress leader.</p><p>Anil Parab, Sena minister and close aide of CM Thackeray, refuted the claims that cases, from Sushant Singh Rajput\u2019s death in 2020 to Mansukh Hiran death case, have been poorly handled by the home department. \u201c In all these cases, there was a clear attempt to defame the MVA government. You mentioned Sushant Singh Rajput case, that probe is still not complete. There are no expected names in the charge sheet. It was only a ploy to defame. In all these cases, we have maintained that let the investigation get over. Whoever is found in the wrong will not be let off.\u201d </p><p>The Sena minister said that Vaze\u2019s suspension was according to the law, where a public servant is suspended within 48 hours of his arrest. </p><p>While speaking about the BJP\u2019s reference to imposition of President\u2019s rule in the state, Jayant Patil said, \u201cThere are norms for imposing the President\u2019s rule in a state. The probe is going on and the state is determined to act against the guilty. If there is an intention to impose President\u2019s rule, then the motive is clearly political. On merits, the truth will be out and the government will take action after the probe is completed,\u201d the state NCP chief said, in his response.</p><p>Patole, after meeting CM Thackeray, said they did not discuss the reshuffle in the state cabinet. \u201cOfficers are transferred in March-April anyway. Some officers may be transferred.\u201d</p>"},

However, a careful perusal of these rules nowhere suggests that the communication to the Lieutenant Governor is to obtain his concurrence or permission,\u201d the bench had held in its majority judgment.</p><p>The judgment also added that, \u201cIt has to be clearly stated that requiring prior concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor would absolutely negate the ideals of representative governance and democracy conceived for the NCT of Delhi by Article 239AA of the Constitution. Any view to the contrary would not be in consonance with the intention of the Parliament to treat Delhi Government as a representative form of government.\u201d</p><p>\u201c...the decisions of the Council of Ministers must be communicated to the Lieutenant Governor but this does not mean that the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor is required,\u201d it further said.</p><p>The bench also suggested that \u201cthe Lieutenant Governor must work harmoniously with his ministers and must not seek to resist them at every step of the way,\u201d while adding that \u201cneither of the authorities should feel that they have been lionised.\u201d</p><p>Interpreting a provision in the NCTD Act that empowers the L-G to refer a matter to the President in case of a difference of opinion between him and the government, the five-judge bench had aid that the L-G \u201cshould not act in a mechanical manner without due application of mind so as to refer every decision of the Council of Ministers to the President.\u201d</p><p>Similarly, the 2019 judgment also acknowledged the L-G must be informed of all decisions of the elected government but this did not mean a requirement of concurrence by him.</p><p>\u201cWe would like to add that normally, and generally, the L-G is expected to honour the wisdom of the council of ministers. He is also expected to clear the files expeditiously and is not supposed to sit over it unduly. He is under duty to bear in mind expediency and urgency of the subject matter of the decisions taken by the GNCTD, wherever situation so demands. That in fact is the facet of good governance,\u201d held the 2019 judgment.</p><p>It also asked the NCT government to give due deference to the unique nature of the role assigned to the L-G, underlining that \u201cboth should realise that they are here to serve the people of NCTD and that mutual cooperation, thus, becomes essential for the effective working of the system.\u201d</p><p>Another amendment seeks to invalidate retrospectively rules made by the legislative assembly of Delhi or committees/house panels to consider the matters of \u201cday-to-day administration of the Capital\u201d or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions.</p><p>This provision could nix the peace and harmony committee\u2019s inquiry into the role of Facebook in the February 2020 riots in north-east Delhi, and will lead to questions over most of the house panels constituted to consider matters of \u201cday-to-day administration of the Capital\u201d.</p><p>Most importantly, the proposed amendment will make constitution of house panels and their exercise vulnerable to challenge before the courts since the objective of their setting up will either relate to the \u201cday-to-day administration of the Capital\u201d or \u201cin relation to the administrative decisions\u201d.</p><p>At least at seven different places in the constitution bench judgment, the apex court has said that Delhi assembly has legislative and executive competence over all subjects except three subjects. The 2021 amendment cites the same judgment but has clearly sought to give an upper hand to the L-G and the Centre in administration of the Capital.</p>"},

Stalin's son Udayanidhi is among the DMK candidates in these elections. The DMK was formed out of a split on the question of nepotism.

An HT analysis underlines at least three interesting trends which have been developing in Tamil Nadu's political fabric.</p><p><strong>Elections have become close contests</strong></p><p>The AIADMK created a history of sorts by retaining power for the second consecutive term in the 2016 assembly elections. Political power had alternated between the DMK and the AIADMK since 1984. However, the 2016 elections were among the most closely contested elections in Tamil Nadu -- if one were to look at median victory margins -- since 1971, the earliest period for which data is available in the database maintained by the Trivedi Centre for Political Data (TCPD) at Ashoka University. A median gives the middle value in a distribution. A long-term look at victory margins also suggests that they have been declining in the post-1990 period.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>See chart 1: Median victory margin in Tamil Nadu assembly elections</strong></p><p>The two main Dravidian parties had unprecedented support in 2016. While Tamil Nadu\u2019s politics has been dominated by Dravidian parties, first the DMK and then its offshoot AIADMK for decades, they never had more than two-thirds of the vote share between them until 2016. This changed in the 2016 elections when their combined vote share crossed 72 per cent. The Congress was the leading party in the erstwhile state of Madras. It was only in 1967 that the DMK won an election in the state which was renamed Tamil Nadu later.</p><p>Since then the Congress has undergone two phases of decline. The first major decline in its vote share came with the AIADMK contesting its first election in the state in 1977 when the Congress was pushed to the third spot. With members of the Congress and the DMK forming their own parties in the 1990s \u2013 such as the Tamil Maanila Congress (Moopanar) and the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam \u2013 the Congress vote share suffered another big decline in vote share. The Left parties \u2013 Communist Party of India (CPI) and Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) - which did not see a decline in vote share with AIADMK\u2019s entry in elections, have also seen their vote share reduce after the formation of many regional parties in the state. The BJP, so far, has been a marginal player in the state\u2019s politics. The fate of all parties except the DMK and AIADMK is largely contingent on their alliance or the lack of it with the major parties.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>See chart 2: Long-term vote share in Tamil Nadu</strong></p><p><strong>Alliance is a tricky business of both the DMK and the AIADMK</strong></p><p>The statistics discussed so far clearly underline the importance of alliance formation in Tamil Nadu. In a state, where median victory margins are around 6 per cent and the two major parties, even at their peak have never crossed more than three-fourth of the total vote share, alliances matter a lot. However, both the DMK and the AIADMK are extremely cautious and reluctant when it comes to seat-sharing. While the DMK has given just 25 assembly constituencies (ACs) to the Congress, its biggest alliance partner in these elections, the AIADMK has offered just 20 ACs to the BJP. A look at past election statistics explains the reluctance on part of the two major parties to offer more ACs to their alliance partners. Both the DMK and the AIADMK perform better against the alliance partners of their opponents than each other. In other words, the probability of a loss is higher for both the DMK and the AIADMK on ACs which are given to alliance partners.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>See chart 3A and 3B: Strike rate of AIADMK and DMK against each other and each other\u2019s alliance partners</strong></p><p><strong>\ufeff</strong></p><p><strong><span class=\"ql-cursor\">\ufeff</span></strong></p><p>Whether Tamil Nadu maintains its trend of declining victory margins, the growing footprint of the two major Dravidian parties and alliances being a necessity and liability at the same time in 2021 will only be known on May 2 when the results are declared.</p>"},

However, an eyewitness later revealed that Yunus was allegedly beaten to death during interrogation. </p><p>Yunus\u2019s body was never recovered. </p><p>In 2018, the eyewitness, Dr Abdul Mateen \u2013 also a suspect in the Ghatkopar blast case -- named four more policemen in the alleged custodial killing, which led special public prosecutor Dhiraj Mirazkar to move an application to include the cops in the list of accused. </p><p>The state issued a notice removing Mirazkar as the special public prosecutor stating that he filed the application without seeking instructions. </p><p>Mirazkar was unavailable for comments despite attempts to get in touch with him. </p><p>\u201cThe case is now pending over the issue of the appointment or rather removal of the special public prosecutor,\u201d said Vaze\u2019s lawyer Raunak Naik. </p><p>The Crime Investigation Department (CID) filed a First Information Report (FIR) against Vaze and three other policemen \u2013 constables Rajendra Tiwari, Sunil Desai and driver Rajaram Nikam \u2013 in 2004 for allegedly beating Yunus to death while he was in custody. </p><p><b>History of the case </b></p><p>On December 2, 2002, a bomb went off in a BEST bus parked outside Ghatkopar railway station, during the evening rush hour, killing two and injuring over 50 people. </p><p>The Mumbai crime branch, of which Vaze was part, picked up a few persons including Yunus on December 25. </p><p>On January 7, 2003, Yunus was reported missing from police custody. The police claimed that he escaped with two other accused while they were being taken to Aurangabad when the vehicle carrying them met with an accident in Ahmednagar district. </p><p>An FIR was registered in connection with the incident at the Parner police station.</p><p>However, during an enquiry into the so-called accident conducted by the special Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) court in Mumbai, Mateen, who was also one of the accused, revealed that he had heard Yunus being beaten, and later vomiting, in an adjacent cell. </p><p>Mateen claimed that Yunus had likely died on January 6. This testimony was corroborated by a third accused in the case. </p><p>The alleged custodial death case was handed over to the CID in May 2003. </p><p>However, after seven months of no information, Yunus\u2019s father Sayed Khwaja Ayub moved the Bombay high court requesting that the Central Bureau of Investigation probe the disappearance of his son. </p><p>On February 25, 2004, the CID team said that they had found some evidence in connection to Yunus\u2019s disappearance and arrested Vaze on March 3. The other three policemen were arrested later that month. All four were placed under suspension, pending investigation.</p><p>In April, the high court directed the CID to record a fresh statement from Mateen and treat that as the FIR in the alleged custodial death case. The state appealed against this direction in the Supreme Court and lost, and eventually, a fresh FIR was registered in the Ghatkopar police station on September 16, 2004. </p><p>The CID completed its probe in October 2006 and filed a charge sheet against 14 policemen, including the four suspended cops. </p><p>In July 2007, the office of the Director General of Police forwarded the case papers to the state government, which accorded sanction to prosecute only the four suspended cops. </p><p>An additional sessions judge framed charges against Vaze, Tiwari, Desai and Nikam, on March 19, 2011. </p><p>In the meantime, Yunus\u2019s mother, Asiya Begum, amended her petition pending before the Bombay HC for compensation and other connected prayers, and sought sanction to prosecute seven more Crime Branch personnel, in addition to the four suspended cops.</p><p>In April 2012, the HC directed the state to pay Yunus\u2019s family a compensation of <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>20 lakh, but rejected Begum\u2019s plea regarding the prosecution of more policemen. Begum appealed against this verdict in the Supreme Court, and the matter is still pending before the apex court. </p><p>Yunus\u2019s brother, Hussain Sayed Khwaja Ayub Yunus said that their petition has not come up as yet. \u201cIt has not even been heard. We unfortunately do not have means to appoint a special lawyer for the Supreme Court. It is like justice delayed and justice denied.\u201d </p><p>Meanwhile, of the 19 persons arrested in connection with the Ghatkopar blast case, nine were discharged from the case and two, including Khwaja, died. On June 11, 2005, the special POTA court acquitted the remaining eight accused. </p><p><b>The trial in Yunus\u2019s death </b></p><p>In January 2018, the prosecution examined Mateen, its first witness in the case.</p><p>\u201cAfter Mateen, no other witness has been examined,\u201d advocate Naik said. </p><p>In his deposition, Mateen named four cops who had also allegedly assaulted Yunus, and whose names were also part of the charge sheet filed by the CID in 2006: Praful Bhosle, Hemant Desai, Rajaram Vhanmane and Ashok Khot. </p><p>On the basis of this testimony, special public prosecutor Mirazkar moved an application to add these four policemen in the list of accused and to try them alongside Vaze and the three constables. </p><p>A controversy erupted over this with the state government claiming that the application was filed without taking instructions. The state issued a notification removing Mirzkar as the special public prosecutor. </p><p>Yunus\u2019s mother challenged the state\u2019s notification in the Bombay high court. </p><p>Meanwhile, in 2016, Vaze filed a petition before the HC challenging the framing of charges against him. </p><p>Vaze resigned from the force in 2007 and joined the Shiv Sena, but he \u2013 and the three other suspended constables -- were reinstated in January 2020. </p><p><b>Asiya Begum\u2019s fight continues </b></p><p>Asiya Begum filed a petition in the Bombay high court challenging their reinstatement last year. </p><p>She claimed that the review committee which included chief secretary Amitabh Gupta and Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh did not have the authority to set aside the 2004 suspension order and hence the reinstatement order should be set aside. </p><p>The state argued that the petitioner did not have a locus as the reinstatement order was an administrative decision. </p><p>The petition had also stated that while the trial against the four suspended cops was pending, the review committee could not have issued orders to reinstate them. </p><p>The petition was last heard on March 9, 2021 by a division bench of justices K K Tated and Riyaz Chagla. The hearing was adjourned to March 31 as Begum\u2019s advocate Mihir Desai sought time to place the translated copies of official documents before the court. </p><p><b>Yunus\u2019 family reacts to Vaze\u2019s arrest </b></p><p>\u201cUpar wale ke paas der hain, par andher nahi [there may be delay but not injustice in the house of God],\u201d Hussain Sayed Khwaja Ayub Yunus, Khwaja Yunus\u2019s brother said, after assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze was suspended on Monday, following his arrest by the National Investigation Authority, in connection with the explosives-laden car found outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani\u2019s home last month. </p><p>\u201cIf he had not be reinstated this would not have happened,\u201d Hussain, 53, added. </p><p>Yunus\u2019s family has been fighting a long battle for justice since his custodial death in 2003, in which Vaze and three other cops were arrested and suspended. The first petition was filed by his father Sayyed Khwaja Ayub in 2004, before the Bombay high court. After Ayub died in 2004, Yunus\u2019s mother Asiya Begum took the fight further. </p><p>\u201cI lost my father. Mother is almost 75 years now. It has been close to 20 years and still we don\u2019t see any hope in case. When will this be over?\u201d Hussain said referring to the trial against the four policemen implicated in his brother\u2019s death. </p><p>\u201cThe trial had just begun when they removed special public prosecutor and now there is none. When will the trial see the light of the day? We just want justice,\u201d Hussain said. </p><p>\u201cWe unfortunately do not have means to appoint a special lawyer for Supreme Court. It is like justice delayed and justice denied,\u201d Hussain said. </p>"},

The concealment about FIRs had come light in the hearing of a plea in December from Moga resident Surjit Singh, who had challenged his dismissal from service, due to pending FIRs. During proceedings of the case, it has come to light that at least 107 convicted cops, including SPs, DSPs, inspectors, and 840 facing serious criminal charges are still serving in Punjab Police. </p><p>An affidavit was filed by Vijay Singh Chauhan, deputy secretary, department of home affairs and justice, Punjab, on October 8 disclosing the names of officers, who were facing criminal cases. However, petitioner\u2019s counsel Balbir Saini contended that the entire information has not been disclosed. On October 28, the court sought an affidavit from Aggarwal. He filed an affidavit on December 10, but on allegations of discrepancies in the same, the court on January 14, asked him to personally look into the matter to ascertain factual aspects. On February 1 this year, he filed an affidavit admitting of wrong information in the December 10 affidavit. </p><p>The high court bench of justice Anupinder Singh Grewal observed that it is apparent that the information, as sought by the court, was not forthcoming. Aggarwal should have taken due care and caution as it is expected from the administrative head of the department to disclose the entire information as had been sought by the court, the bench said, adding that concealment or not disclosing the information sought, amounts to swearing a false affidavit. </p><p>\u201cThe filing of false affidavit has the tendency to subvert, obstruct, impede and interfere in the due course of judicial proceedings, which cannot be overlooked especially when the affidavit has been filed by a senior government officer,\u201d the bench observed, adding that besides the contempt of court, such an act would amount to giving false evidence to court. Before directing institution of a criminal complaint before the competent judicial magistrate for the prosecution of the officer for perjury, I deem it appropriate to issue him notice, the bench added seeking his response within four weeks as to why directions be not issued for filing a complaint with the judicial magistrate for the offence of perjury. </p><p><b>Questions how PPS posted as SSPs </b></p><p>Giving an example, the bench said that Rajinder Singh Sohal, convicted in a criminal case has been posted as the SSP of Gurdaspur. He is a PPS officer and has been posted as Gurdaspur SSP, which is an IPS-cadre post. The continuation of such an officer at the post of the SSP, who is the district head of the police force, would erode the confidence of the people in the police administration apart from being an affront to the rule of law. Therefore, the competent authority should consider transferring him from the post, the bench said. </p><p>It observed that there are several other PPS officers, who have been posted as SSPs of various districts in violation of the Indian Police Service (Cadre) Rules, 1954. Impleading Centre as a party to look into these apparent violations, the court further said that it is apparent that there is arbitrariness in dealing with officers facing criminal cases. \u201cIn our system of governance administered by rule of law, the government cannot act like an absolute despot at its whims and fancies by patronising certain officers while imparting a step-motherly treatment to others,\u201d it said, adding that the need of the hour to put in place a proper structure. </p><p>Now, the government has been asked to file an affidavit by the next date to explain as to why PPS officers have been posted as SSPs of several districts. </p><p>The bench also asked that government committee, which is in the process of framing a policy on action to be taken against cops with criminal cases/ convicted, would come up with a uniform policy while keeping in mind gravity and nature of the offence. The court has directed that till the committee arrives at a decision and considers the individual cases of the officers, no police officer who is charge-sheeted or convicted in a criminal case involving moral turpitude, shall remain posted at a post having public dealing. They shall not be assigned investigation, either as investigating officer or in a supervisory capacity and will not be posted in the vigilance bureau till the final decision is taken by the committee. They shall also not be posted in the district where their criminal case is being tried, the bench said seeking status report by April 28. </p>"},

Sudharm\u2019s petition stated that though Sachin Vaze had cooperated with the central agency, he had been detained without following the due procedure established by law, and hence, he should be brought before HC, and NIA should justify the detention. </p><p>The petition filed through advocate Sunny Punnamiya has averred that Sachin Vaze has been an upright and law-abiding officer working with the Mumbai Police for 17 years but was made a scape goat by some political powers, based on the allegations of Vimla Hiran, the wife of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran who was found dead in a Mumbra creek on March 5. </p><p>Following the discovery of Hiran\u2019s body, his Vimla had approached the anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which was investigating the case of the explosive-laden car found outside the residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani. The car belonged to Mansukh Hiran. Vimla told ATS that she suspected that her husband was murdered. After a case of murder was registered against unknown persons, Vimla started spreading false and baseless allegations against Sachin Vaze, the petition by Sudharm alleged. It further stated that NIA also registered a first information report (FIR) against unknown persons the very next day. </p><p>In his petition, Sudharm claimed that due to Vimla\u2019s allegations, Vaze anticipated his arrest and hence approached the sessions court for anticipatory bail, but it was rejected on March 12. The next day, Vaze was called for interrogation by NIA, which he duly obliged to, though he was not served a notice under section 41 (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). </p><p>Sudharm further claimed that during the interrogation, his brother cooperated with NIA investigators, and gave them all the corroborative pieces of evidences. Yet, following 10 hours of interrogation, Vaze was arrested without being served a copy of FIR or informed of the nature of allegations against him. He was also not allowed to speak to his lawyers or family which was a violation of his fundamental rights, claimed the petition. </p><p>The plea further stated that just before his arrest, Vaze had sent a WhatsApp message to his family, in which he had mentioned that he may be trapped by his fellow officers, and that he may not survive the ordeal. </p><p>\u201cThe haste in which the petitioner\u2019s brother was arrested, clearly shows some ulterior motives and huge political influence and interference with the sole intent to use the petitioner\u2019s brother as a scapegoat to further certain political agendas of some big interested parties. The petitioner\u2019s fundamental rights have been severely violated and the petitioner fears for his brother\u2019s life and limb, as the respondent officers can go to any extent to extract an illegal and false confession from the petitioner\u2019s brother,\u201d the petition further stated. </p><p>In light of these averments and the fact that proper procedure was not followed by NIA officers while detaining and arresting Vaze, the petition prays for directions to NIA to produce his brother before the court and justify his detention in accordance with the procedure established by law, and after hearing the parties, to set him free. </p><p>According to Punnamiya, the petition has been numbered, and will be mentioned before the appropriate bench on Tuesday for an early hearing. </p>"},

Even though the ticket is priced at just <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>10, the ridership continues to remain low, according to SWR.</p><p>The average cost of travelling to Kemepgowda International Airport here ranges from <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>700 to <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>1,400.</p><p>Experts in the city are not surprised at the low figures. \u201cThe train runs at odd hours and the frequency is not great either. Considering the fact that the railway had shut down the service for some work (during the second week of February) shows there is a lack of consistency. It was obvious that the project would not be a success and will require more time to settle,\u201d Srinivas Alavilli, head of civic participation of Janaagraha, a non-profit organisation working for urban governance, said.</p><p>Even though a SWR spokesperson said that efforts are underway to revise the train schedule to attract more passengers, activists claimed that the service was nothing less than eyewash. Instead of a single service only to the airport, the work on the suburban line to the airport which has been delayed due to \u201cbureaucratic egos\u201d should have begun by now, they argued.</p><p>The 41.40 km suburban line connecting Bengaluru city railway station to the airport via Yeshwantpur was approved by the Union Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs in October 2020. Following this, K-RIDE (Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Company), joint venture between the state and Centre, announced that the airport line would be a priority and be completed in three years.</p><p>However, following a meeting between the government and the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL), K-RIDE changed its plan to develop the direct airport line first.</p><p>\u201cEven though the BMRCL has not received approval for their airport line, they are asking K-RIDE not to prioritise the same. Clearly, they are concerned that the sub-urban rail would affect their plans to have a metro line to the airport,\u201d Sanjeev Dyamannavar, a rail activist, said.</p><p>\u201cWith minimal land acquisition requirements, K-RIDE could have ensured that the train chugs to the airport terminal within the stipulated time of three years. But because of this competition, the people of Bengaluru have been denied convenient transport to the airport,\u201d he added.</p><p>Activists also pointed at the lack of coordination between authorities responsible for public transport in the city. \u201cThe smooth integration of the bus, suburban rail and metro is the solution for providing a seamless transportation network. But the fact remains that there is a lack of coordination and an urgency to prioritise the work by these agencies,\u201d Alavilli said.</p><p>Experts believe that a plan to effectively use both the sub-urban rail and metro is still not on the cards.</p><p>A former Indian Railway official, on the condition of anonymity, raised flags over the current plan for the suburban rail network.</p><p>\u201cIf you look at the map of the proposed railway network, it is \u2018urban rail\u2019 rather than \u2018suburban rail\u2019 as it only reaches the edge of the city. Ideally, the suburban railway should have been connected to the district in the outskirts of Bengaluru like Tumkur and Chikkabalapur while metro should have been provided for commuting within the city,\u201d he said.</p><p>He added that when compared to other cities running sub-urban rails, the proposed 148 km is not good enough.</p><p>\u201cBengaluru needs at least a 500-km long suburban rail network (according to the proposal, the suburban rail will be 148-km long). Mumbai has more than 700 km, Chennai has over 500 km while Kolkata has 1,500 km of suburban train. There should be long term planning for such development where commutation to Bengaluru from neighbouring districts would be faster. There is no such planning right now,\u201d he said.</p><p>A K-RIDE official, preferring anonymity, said that work has begun on the Byappanahalli-Yeshwantpur- Chikkabanavara and Heelalige-Byappanahalli- Rajanukunte lines.</p><p>\u201cThis is because of government instructions. It is not that we will not work on the airport line, but it will happen much later,\u201d the official said.</p><p>The official refused to comment on the rivalry between the two agencies leading to the delay in the project. BMRCL spokesperson was not available for comments at the time of filing this report.</p>"},

While depression may occur during beta-blocker therapy, the research suggests beta-blockers are not the likely cause.</p><p>Beta-blockers are a class of medications that reduce the heart rate, the heart's workload and the heart's output of blood, which, together, lower blood pressure. They are a common treatment for cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure, arrhythmias, chest pains and high blood pressure. Researchers have suspected beta-blockers of having negative psychological side effects, including depression, anxiety, drowsiness, insomnia, hallucinations and nightmares.</p><p>\"The possible mental health side effects of beta-blockers have been the subject of discussion in the scientific community for many decades,\" says Reinhold Kreutz, M.D., PhD, a professor at the Berlin Institute of Health, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology and the study's supervising and corresponding author. \"So, our results showing beta-blockers are not the cause of so many of these negative side effects are quite consequential.\"</p><p>The study is the first of its kind to examine the entire spectrum of mental health side effects in relation to beta-blockers. The researchers analyzed data for more than 50,000 individuals from 258 studies including beta-blockers in double-blind, randomized controlled trials. Nearly 70 per cent of the studies were clinical trials focused on high blood pressure treatment, and 31 assessed depression in placebo-controlled trials.</p><p>Results from the comprehensive analysis revealed:</p><p>-Despite being the most frequently reported mental health side effect, depression did not occur more frequently during beta-blocker treatment compared to placebo treatment.</p><p>-The rate of discontinuing medication use due to depression was not any different for those taking beta-blockers compared to those on other treatments.</p><p>-Unusual dreams, insomnia and sleep disorders may be linked to beta-blockers.</p><p>-Among the mental health events analyzed, the most common reason for discontinuing beta-blockers was fatigue/tiredness.</p><p>\"Our results indicate that concerns about adverse mental health events, especially depression, should not affect the decision about beta blockers. Beta-blockers are mostly safe regarding psychological health,\" said Kreutz. \"We found no indication of an association between beta-blocker use and depression. The same was true for most of the other mental health symptoms, as reported in the studies that were included in our analyses. However, sleep-related symptoms such as unusual dreams or insomnia did emerge during beta blocker therapy for some patients.\"</p><p>Kreutz added, \"Patients with a history of cardiovascular events such as a heart attack or stroke were prone to develop psychological complications. Though we found beta-blockers were not causally linked, these patients should be monitored.\"</p><p>The original studies did not include individual patient data, so for this analysis, researchers were unable to investigate whether sleep-related symptoms were persistent for those taking beta-blockers. Additional research is needed to address this question.</p><p>The researchers report there an important limitation to consider when interpreting the results of their analysis: most beta-blocker trials were conducted more than 20 years ago, before a uniform language to describe adverse events was established. Additionally, the authors only considered randomized, double-blind trials for their analysis, which left out some studies that might provide more data on long-term beta-blocker treatment.</p><p><strong>Follow more stories on </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/htlifeandstyle\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/htlifeandstyle?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a></p>"},

This should push up the growth of economy in the state. In terms of GSDP, UP may have attained the status of the second largest economy in India but its rank in terms of per capita income is second from the bottom. The state government should not be sitting on its laurels but continue to make investment in areas like education, health and social welfare so as to improve its rank in human development.

Over the past few months, the Indian government has called on the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states to speed up the process of allowing Indian workers to return to their jobs. </p><p>Jaishankar acknowledged that \u201creal challenges\u201d remain to be addressed regarding the economic impact of the pandemic on Indians employed abroad. </p><p>\u201cThe government is fully cognisant of the employment concerns that our people abroad have in the context of the Covid pandemic. Especially in the Gulf, there has been tremendous economic and social disruption that has impacted them. We have softened it somewhat but real challenges are there to be addressed,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cWe are aware that there are problems of compensation, re-employment and re-skilling that need solutions. And these are today the core of our agenda with our partner governments,\u201d he added. </p><p>Jaishankar said the Gulf has been the focal point of India\u2019s endeavours. \u201cIn recent months, the prime minister has engaged the leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Oman. Under his directions, I have travelled even during the Covid to the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman to discuss with the governments there the welfare of our people,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cBecause of restrictions at their end, such travel was not possible to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. But I have been in regular touch with their foreign ministers,\u201d he said. Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan also travelled to Oman and the UAE, and India recently hosted the UAE\u2019s foreign minister while the Kuwaiti foreign minister too is expected to visit soon, he added. </p><p>The Indian government has concluded air transport bubbles, or temporary reciprocal arrangements for commercial passenger services, with 27 countries until the resumption of regular international flights. Air India has operated more than 9,500 flights that took 1.09 million passengers abroad. </p><p>During visits to West Asia, Jaishankar and Muraleedharan interacted with community organisations and partner governments, and learnt that the \u201coverall picture was that our people were well taken care of during the pandemic by the host authorities\u201d. </p><p>\u201cFrom the governments, the message was of appreciation for the responsibility shown by our people amidst the pressures of the pandemic...The support extended from India for the stay and travel of our citizens was warmly acknowledged by community and governments alike. The provision of medical supplies and food items from India as an exceptional gesture to the Gulf during this period clearly had a powerful resonance,\u201d Jaishankar said. </p><p>\u201cSo did the arrival of health professionals and medical staff, especially the dedicated medical team we sent to Kuwait. From our recent interactions, we have reason to expect that partner governments in the Gulf would be helpful in facilitating the early return of many who had been compelled to go back during the pandemic,\u201d he said. </p><p>The government is also working to help students who returned from abroad during the pandemic to go back to their universities. \u201cSome countries have been more open in this regard than others, obviously reflecting their particular Covid challenge. This, therefore, remains a high priority and our endeavour will be to encourage an early return to normalcy,\u201d Jaishankar said. </p><p>Indian fishermen too faced difficulties because of the pandemic, especially serious problems faced by those working in Iran. Some Gulf nations also witnessed this, and the \u201crepatriation phase is over and the re-employment one has just started\u201d, he added. </p><p>The Vande Bharat Mission brought back nearly 4.6 million people from 98 countries, and Kerala received the maximum returnees, followed by Delhi, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. The UAE was the country from where the maximum number of stranded Indians returned, followed by Saudi Arabia, the US and Qatar. A total of 39% of the returnees were workers, 39% professionals, 6% students and about 8% visitors and 4.7% stranded tourists. </p><p>The government spent Rs.33.5 crore from the Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) to help Indians stranded abroad. </p>"},

The positivity rate has increased, but by God's grace, the mortality rate is low,\" Yediyurappa said. He said the positivity rate has increased in districts like Bidar, Kalaburagi, Bengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Udupi Tumakuru and Dakshina Kannada. \"Experts see this as an indication of Covid-19 second wave.. The technical advisory committee have advised strict enforcement of measures to contain the spread of Covid-19,\" he added. The state has been logging over 900 new cases over the last three days.

He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi would chair a meeting on March 17 with Chief Ministers of various states on the Covid situation, where Karnataka would seek advice and take necessary strict measures, if required. \"I appeal to the people of the state, especially Bengaluru... if you don't want lockdown once again,take strict measures by yourselves,\" he said,regretting that people don't wear masks, awareness has gone and the situation has gone back to what it was earlier.

The Chief Minister said the meeting decided to increase vaccination across the state, as also contact tracing and testing. \"It was also decided to make the RT-PCR test report compulsory for those entering the state at Maharashtra and Kerala borders. I have held discussions with all the district Deputy Commissioners and strict instructions have been given to follow the measures from tomorrow itself,\" he said.

Wearing masks and maintaining social distancing is compulsory and violators would be fined, Yediyurappa said. \"We will see for a week..if people don't cooperate and don't wear masks, we will start imposing fine of <span class=\"webrupee\">\u20b9</span>250... don't push us to take this step.\" The CM said officials have been directed to ensure that not more than 500 people attend social, religious and other events, including weddings. To be prepared for any eventuality, it was decided to make arrangements at Covid hospitals for oxygenated beds, availability at Intensive Care Units and setting up of Covid care centres. The meeting also decided to hold discussions with private hospitals for providing treatment to Covid patients like in the past, Yediyurappa said. Among other issues deliberated at the meeting for implementation was to enhance vaccination of senior citizens and those at slums and rural areas and not ferrying a large number of people in public transport vehicles. </p>"},

We are expecting more doses, but they would probably be Covaxin and so now, we are awaiting Covishield stock which will be given as second doses.\u201d </p><p>The PMC returned 15,000 of a 20,000 stock of Covishield doses received on Monday evening from the PCMC, as the PCMC is also seeing a huge response to the vaccination drive from its citizens. </p><p>On Monday, many beneficiaries did not get the vaccine as their scheduled slots were cancelled, or hospitals put up notices stating that vaccinations have been temporarily suspended. </p><p>One such citizen, PS Gadkari, 82, who lives in Wadgaonsheri, registered three of his family members, which was later cancelled. </p><p>He said, \u201cI had registered myself and two of my relatives, Nanda (61) and Bapu Kamble (64) for vaccination on Saturday at PMC\u2019s Meenatai Thackeray health centre.

However, we only got 50,000 doses of Covaxin. We will now keep two of our hospitals exclusively for a second dose of Covishield and rest only for Covaxin to avoid confusion.

It means, Ganga jal (Ganga water) was considered the biggest benchmark of cleanliness. Today, it becomes the responsibility of all of us to take Ganga once again to the same level of cleanliness, which we find in the words of Sant Kabir, Sant Ravidas and the sages of ancient times.\u201d </p><p>\u201cKeeping the river Ganga clean, preserving the environment and enriching our culture and heritage is not only the work of governments, but also the social and personal responsibility of all countrymen,\u201d the President said and added that this thought needed to be adopted and assimilated nationwide.</p><p>\u201cFor cleaning the Ganga and environmental conservation, the government launched Namami Gange, the Integrated Ganga Conservation mission, in 2015. I am satisfied that this mission has begun showing good results. But we haven\u2019t achieved the goal of complete Ganga cleaning yet. In addition, large capacity sewage treatment plants are being set up from Rishikesh to Gangasagar to make the Ganga clean,\u201d he observed. </p><p>The President also said, \u201cI believe that the Ganga and our culture have been based on each other. The cleanliness of the Mother Ganga is an important criterion for the cleanliness of our environment. The preservation and promotion of the Ganga, the environment and culture are the basis of the development of our country.\u201d </p><p>It was not enough to see the Ganga just as a river as it was the lifeline of Indian culture and the conduit for spirituality and faith, he said.</p><p>The civilization of the Ganga River Basin can be called an aquatic civilization, he said, adding that \u201cGanga jal is really the water of life.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTherefore, water conservation in the Ganga river basin and reducing flood and erosion are both necessary. With both these objectives, the goal of the cleanliness of the Ganga and the protection of the environment are also connected,\u201d he added. </p><p>\u201cIn fact, the Ganga is the identity of the people of India and this public sentiment is reflected in a popular song,\u201d the President said. </p><p>The area of the Ganga and its tributaries is spread over 11 states and has been named the Ganga River Basin. According to an estimate, the region is inhabited by 43% of the country\u2019s population. It is also the most densely populated area, he said.</p><p>Amazing examples of attachment to the Ganga were found in the memoirs of Bharat Ratna Shehnai maestro (the late) Bismillah Khan saheb, President Kovind said.</p><p>\u201cDuring his visit to Mumbai, many music lovers requested him to settle there. Khan saheb used to say, \u2018Mujhe to le jaaoge, main yahan bas bhi jaunga, lekin yahan Mumbai meain, Ganga maiya kahan se laaoge (Even if I settle down in Mumbai, how will you bring the Ganga there)\u2019. Such was his bond with the Ganga.\u201d </p><p>Strike balance between antiquity, modernity </p><p>Expressing happiness over transformation of Kashi, the President said the changing form had also preserved the city\u2019s antiquity.</p><p>\u201cHowever, antiquity does not mean inertia. The inertia of any country and society causes its decay and decline. That is why I urge the people of Banaras to strike a balance between antiquity and modernity,\u201d he said. </p><p>\u201cBanaras has a wonderful confluence of spirituality, literature and music. Gautam Buddha gave his first message in Sarnath, located in the same area, about 2600 years ago. Adi Shankaracharya had received the knowledge in Kashi itself that there is only one Brahma in all beings,\u201d he remarked. </p><p>PM Modi\u2019s efforts praised</p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the MP from Varanasi, had taken the initiative to increase the cleanliness of the Ganga and the splendour of Kashi, the President said.</p><p>He added that the people of Kashi would remember that the Prime Minister launched the campaign to clean the ghats of Varanasi by cleaning the Assi Ghat. He used a spade to remove silt deposited at the ghat.</p><p>The President said he was informed that the ghats of Varanasi were now clean and tidy.</p><p>\u201cThe emphasis on cleanliness of the Ganga river, the ghats and the city of Banaras has not only given a boost to environmental protection but has made the journey to it more enjoyable for the tourists,\u201d he said.</p>"},

He admits that he attempts to find something new every time he picks a project instead of working with a stylised baggage.</p><p>\u201cI go back to scratch in every project, and approach every project with a fresh (perspective). I\u2019m a bundle of nerves and I\u2019m always searching for something. That quest in me is still alive,\u201d Hooda tells us, taking a break from his packed shooting schedule in Lucknow.</p><p>The actor, who spent six years in Australia as a student, during which he worked as a taxi driver, got his big break in 2001 with Mira Nair\u2019s Monsoon Wedding. He showed his acting chops in films such as Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster (2011), Highway (2014), Sarbjit and Sultan (both 2016), and made his international web debut last year with Chris Hemsworth-starrer Extraction. </p><p>Strangely though, Hooda says he doesn\u2019t really remembers much about his roles. </p><p>\u201cI\u2019m a new person every time.

You have done this before\u2019...

Playing away from home, Shaw\u2019s shots pinged off his bat at Baroda\u2019s Reliance Stadium, where the sound of ball hitting the bat is clear and loud as it is located in the middle of a thick green cover.</p><p><br></p><p>He was on song, racing away to 66 off 62 balls. Then, just as suddenly, Shaw was bowled. Baroda\u2019s first-change bowler, Abhimanyu Rajput, could have hardly believe what he had done, castling the in-form batsman through the gate. It was well against the run of play, for, until that point, Shaw was not even beaten. But Rajput had produced the incoming ball -- the only chink in the young man\u2019s batting technique.</p><p>That match, Shaw went on to strike a double century in the second innings, but it didn\u2019t camouflage the exposed weakness. Shaw continued to score big runs across platforms but he also continued to get out to the incoming ball constantly. Enough for the word to spread. A year later, that chink was exposed on the world stage with one such delivery by Pat Cummins in Adelaide. This, after having chopped Mitchell Starc on to his stumps to be dismissed for a duck in the same match, meant his tour of Australia ended after the first Test itself.</p><p>Observing Shaw closely was former India coach Greg Chappell. As a man manager in a dressing room full of superstars, Chappell didn\u2019t have much success. But as a batting technician, he is still rated highly, having been the standout Australian batsman of his era. So, just when everyone began writing Shaw off, Chappell got in touch with the young opener while he was still in Australia to share his observations, according to a source close to Shaw.</p><p>Chappell believed it to be a simple mental block that Shaw had to overcome when facing a bowler with considerable pace. Technically, the advice was to get his weight on the front foot, expecting the full ball and be ready to get a good stride forward to meet it. Shaw wasn\u2019t doing that, according to Chappell, because he was worried about genuine pace. That was the crux of it \u2013 fear of raw pace was making Shaw hang back, which meant his weight was behind him and not on the front foot. So, when the weight hangs back and the hands are pushed forward, a gap appears between bat and pad. If the front knee bends and the weight goes forward over the front foot, the bat and pad stay together. It was as precise and simple as that.</p><p>Chappell suggested that Shaw deal with the mental block first. His technical tip to Shaw was he has to expect the full ball (which is the first point of release) and deal with what comes (in case of a short ball) by trusting his experience and reflexes. Because, if a batsman worries about the bouncer, he will never get his weight forward. Like in Adelaide\u2019s second innings, where his feet simply didn\u2019t move against Cummins\u2019s pace.</p><p>Shaw\u2019s transformation began to show long before he returned to India \u2013 it was first spotted in the Indian team nets itself after the Adelaide debacle. More technical nuances were corrected by coach Ravi Shastri and batting coach Vikram Rathour as Shaw spent long hours. But, Subhman Gill\u2019s impressive start to his Test career and Rohit Sharma\u2019s return into the team meant there was no chance for Shaw to be considered for the rest of that tour.</p><p>So, with nothing else to do but warm the bench and make technical changes in the nets, Shaw looked ahead to the Vijay Hazare Trophy to announce his return. And what a statement it was \u2013 amassing a record 827 runs for title-winners Mumbai in eight games, including a double-hundred. Now, according to his Mumbai coach Ramesh Powar, as well as the assistant coach of Delhi Capitals Pravin Amre, the problems against the incoming ball have been sorted.</p><p>\u201cEarlier, he was slightly late for the ready position. Now he gets there early so he can react to inswing or outswing or any late movement,\u201d says Powar, who has seen further improvement since he held Mumbai\u2019s first net session in preparation for Vijay Hazare on February 11. \u201cHe seems to know exactly what he is doing, since we started these sessions in February. I once asked him what he had changed and he shook his head and said \u2018nothing, only the mindset is a little different\u2019.\u201d</p><p>Shaw is also said to have told his Mumbai coach that he is now ready to do what it takes \u2013 from drills in his room to visualising the downswing of his bat (visualisation is a mantra Chappell advocates as well). Amre, however, began the process of working with Shaw a little differently. He showed his IPL ward footage from the video analysts and asked him what he would like to work on.</p><p>\u201cI believe that when you play with the full face of the bat, there is more chance of middling the ball. In this Vijay Hazare, he has not got out bowled in any of the matches, (which means) he is protecting his wickets (well),\u201d says Amre, who spent close to five days working one-on-one with Shaw in the lead up to Vijay Hazare. \u201cThe bat swing is the key -- how the down swing comes -- and your footwork.\u201d</p><p>Both his bat swing and bat speed have stood out for those who watched Shaw bat in the domestic 50-over tournament. \u201cThe big change I am seeing is the bat flow. The way he was hitting the ball over covers, both his bat speed and downswing have been amazing. I have rarely seen such bat speeds,\u201d says Powar. \u201cOnce your mind is fine, then it is easy for positive changes to take place.\u201d</p><p>The IPL is just a month away and for Delhi Capitals, an in-form Shaw is crucial for their campaign. DC coach Ricky Ponting had done Shaw\u2019s confidence no good by openly dissecting his technical weaknesses in the media, but behind-the-scenes, the IPL franchise continued to put in work on the lad. Amre noticed that Shaw\u2019s confidence was down and addressed that first, before holding that proverbial mirror in front of him and reading him the riot act.</p><p>\u201cAt that moment, I felt he needed emotional support. And Delhi Capitals is always up to providing help to its players. And Prithvi is our key player,\u201d says Amre. \u201cAs a coach I first wanted to understand what he needed. Cricket wise, the best medicine for any batsmen out of form is always runs under the belt.\u201d</p><p>Those runs have now arrived in abundance in domestic cricket and may yet translate into a comeback in international cricket. But Shaw will know that his true test will be to face the likes of Cummins in Australia \u2013 with his natural incoming ball and his control over the landing \u2013 if he gets that opportunity again. Until then, though, the lesser bowlers are in trouble for a fully flowing Shaw has a wide range of strokes, where the bowler's margin for error is nearly zero. But even more dangerously, in full flow, Shaw is near unstoppable.</p>"},

I am not being able to stand and address you and for this I ask for forgiveness\u201d, said Banerjee.</p><p>It was an unusual sight to see because Banerjee, who usually walks from one end of the dais to the other while addressing her public rallies, was seen sitting on a wheel chair with her left foot resting on a stool.</p><p>\u201cSome people had thought that I wouldn't be able to go out with this broken leg. But elections are near. I have pain in my body. <a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/search?q=mamata%20banerjee\" target=\"_blank\">But I felt that the people are in more pain</a> than what I am going through. They need to stay well and peacefully,\u201d she said in another rally in Baghmundi, also in Purulia district.</p><p>The BJP had made deep inroads in Purulia and other districts of Jangalmahal including Jhargram and West Midnapore in 2019. The TMC supremo on Monday tried to utilise the public sentiment to garner votes this time.</p><p>\u201cI still believe that TMC workers are very powerful. You have fought hard, so why would you retract today? If I can fight with a broken leg, if I can fight even after my hand was fractured and my head was injured, then why wouldn\u2019t you fight? Those of you who are displeased and still sitting back must come out and fight the battle. We have to give a befitting reply to the BJP,\u201d she said.</p><p>Banerjee mounted an attack on the Centre over hike in LPG prices and disinvestment and privastisation policies while taking a jibe at the BJP for fielding MPs in the assembly elections.</p><p>\u201cFrom Bengal BJP got 18 MPs. Now some of them are contesting the assembly elections. If they have failed to do anything as MPs, they would definitely play dugdugi (damru) if they become MLAs,\u201d she added.</p><p>Raising slogans such as BJP hatao, desh bachao and Hum Larenge, Karenge, Jeetenge, Baneerjee said: \u201cNo matter how you try you won\u2019t be able to stop me or stifle me. I will continue to fight against you.</p><p>While Banerjee addressed back to back rallies in Purulia, her nephew Abhishek Banerjee also addressed two rallies and participated in a road show at West Midnapore.</p><p>\"Today the Union home minister was scheduled to address a rally at Jhargram. He, however, could not come because of some technical snags in his helicopter. But some pictures which I received showed that the crowds outside tea stalls are larger than what had gathered at the rally ground to hear Shah,\" he said.</p><p>West Bengal will vote in eight phases between March 27 and April 29.</p>"},

This was the first interaction between Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden in a multilateral forum since the change of power in Washington earlier this year, though they have spoken on the phone since Biden took over.</p><p>In the past two decades, bilateral relations have grown under successive Democratic and Republican administrations, with the two countries cooperating on a wide range of areas, from trade, commerce and technology to defence and terrorism. The two have also been working together on several multilateral forums. In recent years, Quad has come to be seen as a platform that will serve as a counterweight to China. In fact, the Donald Trump administration had even floated the idea of an Asian NATO.</p><p>Some in India, who have been increasingly worried about the Chinese border transgressions in recent years, may have been hoping for Quad to become just that. Biden\u2019s participation in last Friday\u2019s summit signals that his administration does indeed see strategic potential in Quad.</p><p>However, judging by the remarks delivered by Biden and the other leaders at the summit, it is clear that Quad will serve as a multi-dimensional forum that will address myriad topics from economic growth to health care, but not as a military alliance.</p><p>There are already signs that ties are moving back to the old days of being channelled through institutions and processes. Biden is a firm believer in ironing out differences and cementing ties through multilateral forums and bilateral institutional co-operation. So, we will see a sharp departure from the presidentially-centred diplomacy that was the hallmark of the Trump White House. But, that does not mean Biden will not forge a good working relationship with Modi.</p><p>During the campaign, there were concerns among some in India about Biden because of his criticism of India on issues such as Kashmir and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Many were also worried whether Modi\u2019s relationship with Trump, especially the two campaign-style rallies where they made join appearances in Houston and Ahmedabad, would hamstring New Delhi when dealing with Biden. While we are likely to hear US concerns on Kashmir and CAA, they are not going to be deal-breakers.</p><p>Another issue that pundits in both countries have been keeping a close eye on is, of course, China. Beijing has been a factor in US-India bilateral relations since the early 2000s, when China arrived as an economic power and its spectacular rise on the world stage began. Some Indian analysts have suggested that the recent military disengagement by both New Delhi and Beijing would not have taken place if then secretary of state Mike Pompeo were still in office because of his continuous attempts to insert himself into the India-China dispute.</p><p>Under the current secretary of state, Antony Blinken, the US is more likely to play the role of a firefighter, rather than that of an arsonist. That does not, however, mean Washington will be blind to potential Chinese aggression.</p><p>Even though the Quad summit and the readout of the Modi-Biden call did not mention China, they both emphasised the importance of a free and open Indo-Pacific. It means China will remain a factor in India-US relations, but not in the way anti-China hawks in Washington and New Delhi envisaged during the Trump administration.</p><p>Biden understands geopolitics better than most other heads of state, having served in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for decades. He has more India expertise than any previous president, which will only be a good thing for bilateral relations. But it\u2019s not Biden\u2019s experience and expertise alone that will count. </p><p>It will equally be the extensive experience and expertise of others whom he will bring to the table to meet with their Indian counterparts to work collaboratively to construct policy positions that will work to the benefit of both nations and the world.</p><p>Frank F Islam is an entrepreneur, civic leader, and thought leader based in Washington DC</p><p>The views expressed are personal</p>"},

{"source": "HindustanTimes", "headline": "In poll season, the security of leaders", "link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-poll-season-the-security-of-leaders-101615816670958.html", "content": "<p>The heady mix of chanting crowds, streaming banners, blaring loudspeakers and curious onlookers can drive any political leader to violate security and safety protocols during election campaigns. The exuberance is infectious enough to make even security personnel complacent and disregard the basic canons of protection. Popular leaders from across the globe love reaching out to the fawning masses, literally throwing all caution to the wind. History is witness to many such serious mishaps and yet, unfortunately, this keeps repeating itself, since no lessons are learnt.</p><p>The injury suffered by Mamata Banerjee, during her public rally in Nandigram after filing her nomination, is a case in point. The Election Commission (EC) report, compiled by special observers, terms it as an accident caused by critical gaps in the security arrangements laid out by district authorities. The state police finding is along the same lines. The EC suspended director, security, and SP, Nandigram but strangely spared the collector and only transferred him.</p><p>But a chief minister (CM) getting hurt on an election campaign does raise issues of safety and security of candidates during electioneering. More so, when the CM has Z+ scale of security. It is the highest scale accorded in individual protection against threats emanating from terrorists and anti-national elements. The recent internecine battles between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) cadres warranted strict implementation of security and safety guidelines by Banerjee\u2019s security personnel. </p><p>A Z+ scale of security provides layered protection comprising an isolation cordon too, which is critical for insulating the protectee from an assault or proximate threat. While the protected person is on the move, the personal security officer (PSO) is responsible for opening and closing of the vehicle door. In the current case, one theory is that a car door hit a standing pillar and, while closing banged against the victim\u2019s leg. If only an advance recce of the road show was conducted, two imminent threats would have stood out \u2014 pillars on the way and unchecked crowds lined up sans barricade. Even if the crowd was friendly, mobile security teams could have managed a semblance of order and warned of the pillars ahead, along the way.</p><p>Another glaring security lapse was the manner in which the injured was carried to the hospital 125 km away, lying in the same vehicle. Every state has a security manual for the CM\u2019s security which is scrupulously followed. Advance planning for such rallies would surely include an ambulance in the arrangements, with a doctor and paramedics.</p><p>Before every election, an elaborate exercise is undertaken for studying threat assessment of political leaders, and the state government is alerted on the security guidelines to be followed. However, politicians mostly disregard the advice of even senior police officers. The personal security detail merely stands as a silent observer of what goes on \u2014 in the name of all being free and fair during elections. Candidates, precariously perched on their vehicles, standing with the door half open and waving to the crowd, are watched helplessly by the accompanying security personnel.</p><p>The alleged presence of the director and deputy director, security at the rally has spawned a huge debate of jurisdiction between EC and the state government. TMC leaders have accused EC of usurping the law-and-order authority from the state, resulting in such lapses. EC has retorted stating that law and order was not taken over and still remained under the state.</p><p>A former chief election commissioner has said that before every election, a notification puts every police officer, from the director general of police (DGP) downwards to the constable, on deputation to EC. Then, how can EC escape responsibility? It transferred the DGP and key officers of the state to eschew perceived bias in the conduct of elections. It also announced an unprecedented eight-phase poll schedule in exercise of its unfettered powers. If law and order was so fragile, then wasn\u2019t it incumbent on EC to issue strict guidelines for compliance of security and safety of candidates? Isn\u2019t safety of star campaigners, especially during exciting but dangerous road shows, essential? </p><p>Mamata Banerjee is not just the CM but the most popular local leader in West Bengal. She is the lone star of Trinamool \u2014 the main battle tank against the BJP juggernaut. Her safety is paramount. Then why did the Trinamool not think of getting her a custom-made vehicle, which would enable her to participate in such rallies with safety while waving to the crowds? Many political leaders have benefited from using such vehicles.</p><p>A number of issues arise from Mamata Banerjee\u2019s accident for the conduct of elections in future. Central and state security agencies have to play a much more assertive role in assessing threat perception, laying out security cordons and firmly implementing them. The candidates must adhere to security and safety norms for their own good and smooth conduct of elections. And, lastly, EC, while denying that it is micromanaging governance activities during the period, should accept some measure of responsibility for such lapses and take serious corrective measures to prevent their recurrence in future.</p><p>Yashovardhan Azad is a former IPS officer who served as Secretary (Security), Government of India.

His son, MK Stalin, is finally leading the party \u2014 and could well become the state\u2019s next chief minister. But the focus is not as much on Mr Stalin within the DMK as it is on his son, Udhaynidhi Stalin, who has been given a ticket to contest from the same assembly constituency which his grandfather once held. An actor who became active in the party\u2019s youth wing, Udhaynidhi Stalin will have to rise through the party\u2019s hierarchy just as his father did \u2014 but being a third-generation dynast gives him a natural edge. It is also further evidence that a party rooted in the idea of rationality and wider social justice has become a family enterprise \u2014 given the extensive control of the wider Karunanidhi family over the party apparatus.</p><p>In West Bengal, while chief minister Mamata Banerjee remains the face of the Trinamool Congress and the party\u2019s key campaigner, there is now little doubt that her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, a parliamentarian, is possibly the second-most powerful person in the organisation. From poll strategy to finances, public relations to intra-party issues, Mr Banerjee is playing an important role \u2014 with speculation rife that he is being groomed as the party\u2019s next leader. This has alienated other veteran leaders, but the control of the Banerjee family over the party is absolute.</p><p>Dynastic politics is neither new in India, nor confined to these regional forces. It has complex sociological roots, from family elders in politics prodding their young to take on the same professional route to issues of trust since party finances are closely controlled within a circle of trust; from the political ambition of those who can see a short-cut to state power because of family links to mass support for a family brand. But none of this is adequate justification for the rise of dynasts, and as voting patterns show, a young and new India is increasingly (albeit not always) sceptical of those who have little to show but family lineage.</p>"},
{"source": "HindustanTimes", "headline": "Manage privatisation, with political finesse | HT Editorial", "link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/manage-privatisation-with-political-finesse-hteditorial-101615816732630.html", "content": "<p>A key government initiative this year will be the proposed privatisation of public sector enterprises, while the State will confine itself to the bare minimum presence in strategic sectors. Coupled with the monetisation of assets, as proposed in the budget, this will herald a major change in India\u2019s political economy, where, over time, the State will retreat from directly managing companies and assets and confine itself to a broader regulatory and oversight rule. This newspaper supports the privatisation drive and believes that it is not the State\u2019s business to be in business. There was a historical context for the government to invest in public sector enterprises in the initial decades after Independence, but that era is long over. </p><p>But it is important to recognise that privatisation is not merely an economic decision \u2014 it is squarely within the realm of politics. It is tied to questions about the nature and responsibility of the State, the future of employees in units which are meant to be privatised, and the future economic implications in sectors which move into private hands. And that is why it is crucial to manage this much-needed process of privatisation with political finesse. </p><p>This includes reaching out to all political and economic stakeholders \u2014 from Opposition parties to trade unions. It includes building a strong intellectual case for privatisation \u2014 while reassuring those who fear that they will bear the brunt of the consequences of reforms. And it includes keeping a flexible outlook and be willing to engage in negotiations rather than adopt an absolutist attitude. As the controversy over farm laws shows, economic reforms are deeply contentious now and the role of the private sector continues to be viewed with suspicion. The government must be transparent and consultative, while the Opposition must be responsible and not engage in mindless obstructionism of sound policy initiatives. </p>"},

However, they were placed on a genuinely secure footing following the US-India civilian nuclear agreement of 2008. Since then, there has been a remarkable bipartisan consensus about the significance of India in the US foreign policy calculus.</p><p>Even Donald Trump, who used strong-arm tactics in trade negotiations, curbed H-1B visas and saw the relationship in transactional terms did not undermine it. Though otherwise mercurial, he nevertheless allowed his administration to adopt a pro-India stance when the Sino-Indian border troubles flared up in Ladakh last year.</p><p>The Joe Biden administration assumed office with the promise of moving away from the nativist outlook of the Trump administration. Earlier, during the presidential campaign, Biden made it clear that his administration would return to multilateralism, promote democracy and global human rights and stand up to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Russia\u2019s attempts to support and promote authoritarian regimes across the world.</p><p>Earlier this month, the White House released a document, the <i>Interim National Security Strategic Guidance</i>, which provides a working blueprint for the administration\u2019s new national security strategy. To no one\u2019s surprise, it affirms the administration\u2019s return to multilateralism, commits it to strengthening long-standing alliances and declares its interest in promoting democracy and protecting human rights. There is little question that the administration will attempt to implement these goals.</p><p>However, it has already recognised that certain trade-offs are inevitable. To that end, last month, it released an unclassified version of a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) analysis of the killing of the Saudi dissident and <i>The Washington Post </i>columnist, Jamal Khashoggi. (The Trump administration, in an effort to avoid offending the Saudi monarchy, and with its lack of interest in promoting human rights abroad, kept it under wraps.) The report left little or no doubt that the murder could not have taken place without the imprimatur of the Saudi Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the <i>de facto </i>ruler of the desert kingdom. In its wake, the US Department of the Treasury placed a series of sanctions on a number of high-level officials in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>However, the administration chose not to impose any costs on the Crown Prince. Political commentators argued that the administration decided not to publicly upbraid him for fear of unsettling this long-standing relationship. Clearly, as has happened many a time in previous administrations, this one too felt the need to strike a delicate balance between ideals and self-interest.</p><p>Will the administration feel compelled to strike a similar balance in dealing with India? On the one hand, the report has, albeit quite briefly, alluded to the significance of India in promoting cooperation and advancing its strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific. Yet, in several places, this document highlighted US concerns about promoting democracy and human rights on a global basis. During the campaign, both Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris expressed their unease about the state of human rights in India in general, and in Kashmir in particular. After assuming office, the administration has raised these concerns again. The issue is one that the administration will not abandon. This is even more likely as there are a number of key Congressional Democrats who are prone to holding it accountable on this particular score.</p><p>However, it is also evident that the Biden administration continues to attach considerable strategic significance to the Indo-US relationship. This is reasonable to infer given that Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, is making his initial trip to India this week. His visit signals a continuity in policy. In the meanwhile, last week, at the virtual Quad conference, the members agreed to boost vaccine distribution and coordinate their policies to counter China\u2019s assertiveness.</p><p>Given these two competing imperatives, how is the Biden administration likely to tackle them? Faced with the growing aggressiveness of China, India remains a prospective linchpin in American regional strategy. Consequently, the US will elicit India\u2019s cooperation in guaranteeing security and stability in the region. Yet it cannot allow its stated commitment to protecting human rights and boosting democracy to ring hollow. How then is it likely to weigh in on these demands which are likely to be at odds?</p><p>The strategic relationship, after years of vicissitudes, is now stable. More to the point, New Delhi, after decades of vacillation, sees considerable value in it despite some lingering reservations. Accordingly, it cannot distance itself from the US. Despite this strategic convergence, the new dispensation in Washington, it will not, as occasion demands, shy away from quietly, but firmly, reminding New Delhi to adhere to its democratic traditions. Negotiating between these two shoals may prove to be taxing for both Washington and New Delhi.</p><p>Sumit Ganguly is a distinguished professor of political science and holds the Rabindranath Tagore Chair in Indian Cultures and Civilizations at Indiana University</p><p>The views expressed are personal</p>"},

He would still be alive,\u201d the 82-year-old said.</p><p>Within weeks, the Grand Princess had captured the world\u2019s attention and made the coronavirus real to millions in the United States when thousands of passengers on a subsequent trip were quarantined as the ship idled off the California coast.</p><p>A year later, some of those who traveled on the Grand Princess remember the pain that followed, others the frustration of shifting directives as they were confined to their rooms. They now realize they had a front-row seat to a historic moment.</p><p>Ultimately, more than 100 people who were on the ship were infected with the coronavirus. At least eight died.</p><p>One was Lucio Gonzalez, an athletic 73-year-old who had worked maintaining trails in the California Parks system for 25 years. On the sunny afternoon they boarded, the Gonzalezes thought only of their high-seas adventure. But a few days after the trip ended, Lucio Gonzalez started feeling ill. Eventually, he went to the hospital.</p><p>\u201cThey put him on a ventilator for three weeks and two days, and after that he died,\u201d his widow said. \u201cI never saw him alive again.\u201d</p><p>Hours after the Gonzalezes disembarked on Feb. 21 in San Francisco, a new group boarded for a 10-day trip to Hawaii. The Grand Princess was headed for a stopover in Ensenada, Mexico, when officials ordered it to reroute to California on March 4 after a 71-year-old Rocklin man who had been on the same trip as the Gonzalezes died of Covid-19.</p><p>Worried about the virus, officials blocked the ship carrying 2,400 passengers and 1,100 crew members from anchoring at its home port of San Francisco. President Donald Trump said he didn't want the passengers to disembark on American soil \u201cbecause I like the numbers being where they are,\u201d but that he would yield to health officials' advice.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p>On the ship, Laurie Miller, her friend Karen Schwartz Dever and their husbands shared the dinner table and talks of their Hawaii adventures with fellow travelers Steven and Michele Smith.</p><p>Soon, they were ordered to quarantine in their cabins. Meals were delivered to their rooms, where they watched their ship, and at times themselves, on television newscasts.</p><p>The sight of four California Air National Guard members rappelling from a helicopter to drop off test kits made the coronavirus real for Miller. Until then she had thought of it as something happening far away in Asia.</p><p>Even after the ship anchored in Oakland on March 9, the ordeal was not over. Transferring passengers to military bases for quarantine took days, and they were in packed buses for hours. Once at the bases, many crowded together for meals and updates, despite the Centers for Disease Control advising people to keep 6 feet (2 meters) between them.</p><p>\u201cThere was so much inconsistent information from day-to-day that it felt like we were guinea pigs,\u201d said Miller, of San Jose.</p><p>Steven and Michele Smith's plan for a 10-day break from overseeing the construction of homes in Paradise, California, decimated by wildfire in 2018, turned into a five-week event that Steven Smith said put them \u201cin a sort of exclusive club of people in ground zero of the corona crisis.\u201d</p><p>The three couples have stayed in touch through a Facebook group, where passengers recall not just the stress they went through, but the champagne fountains, four-course meals and black-tie nights. More recently, the conversation has turned to future cruises.</p><p>Miller and Schwartz Dever, who met on a cruise, have booked one for next year to the Great Lakes. The Smiths bought stock in Carnival Cruise Line after seeing talk about people itching to get back.</p><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t live your life based on something that might happen once every 100 years,\u201d Steven Smith said. \u201cYou live your life in anticipation of good times and adventures ahead.\u201d</p><p>Schwartz Dever, like her friends, doesn\u2019t blame Princess Cruises for how the ship outbreak was handled.</p><p>\u201cThe people running the cruise were doing exactly what the government told them to do,\u201d she said.</p><p>Lucio Gonzalez\u2019s family disagrees. They are suing Princess Cruises and owner Carnival Corp. for negligence and wrongful death \u2014 one of dozens of lawsuits by passengers and surviving relatives. Carnival declined to comment on pending litigation.</p><p></p><p><br></p><p>Princess Cruises said in a statement that its response to the pandemic was based on \u201cthe directives of governments and public health authorities and consistent with industry standards. As new information about Covid-19 became available, we continually adapted our policies and protocols to reflect the latest understanding of the virus.\u201d</p><p>Gonzalez family attorney Mary Alexander said the Grand Princess should not have sailed after an earlier outbreak on Carnival's Diamond Princess off the coast of Japan.</p><p>\u201cThey knew more than anybody else about what was going on with Covid and what was going on on cruise ships and they should have never sailed. They didn\u2019t take any special precautions to protect the passengers, they didn\u2019t warn them about the virus. People died as a result,\u201d Alexander said.</p><p>Miguel Gonzalez said he wants to make sure the industry is held accountable and future passengers aren\u2019t put in danger as his father was.</p><p>\u201cI just miss him and I just wish I could have more time with him,\u201d he said.</p>"},

The word also symbolizes the brand of cricket India play, which to be honest, wouldn't have been possible without how captain Virat Kohli has changed the outlook of the team. From senior pros like Shikhar Dhawan to youngsters such as Hardik Pandya or Rishabh Pant, players of the Indian cricket team are ready for any challenge thrown at them.</p><p><strong>Also Read | </strong><a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/cricket/-it-isn-t-easy-to-bat-in-a-carefree-fashion-on-debut-laxman-hails-ishan-kishan-s-fearless-approach-against-england-101615801770741.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>It's not easy to bat in a carefree and fearless fashion in your debut match: Laxman on Ishan</strong></a></p><p>Weighing on the same, former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar feels players like Ishan and Pant in particular demonstrate exactly that, and the pattern in the batting suggests that youngsters of this Indian team are not worried about losing their wickets and instead focus on backing their instincts to get results.</p><p>\"The thing to like about Ishan Kishan is that he is an excellent player of spin. But more importantly, what is exciting me is that these are batsmen who are not afraid to get out. Rishabh Pant, Ishan Kishan\u2026 they are not looking to extend their innings. No long-term plans.

But you saw the Mumbai Indians approach that Ishan Kishan has all the time batting down the order and not necessarily at the top, and that came into the Indian team today,\" Manjrekar added.</p><p>\"He is a formidable batsman for any bowler purely because if you pitch it up to him, he can hit you straight into the crowd. Bowl it short, he can pull you in the stands. And the pull that he plays is not an instinctive one kind of pull, one style that a lot of Indian batsmen play. His pull is not an inherent shot that we grow up playing. He actually picks his spots when he's playing the pull shot.\"</p>"},

Well, IIM students always make it to the top-most layer of the entire workforce. So, it\u2019s no wonder that the competition for entry into the top MBA colleges of the country, like IIMs, is steep. The first step for admission to a prestigious management institute is to crack the Common Aptitude Test (CAT).</p><p>\u201cOn an average, above 2 lakh students appear for CAT every year. But there are roughly 10-15 thousand seats for MBA in top management colleges including the 20 IIMs of the country, IITs and other good institutes. A candidate needs to be in the top 1-5 percent of the total number CAT examinees to get a call from the best institutes. This is what makes MBA admissions so challenging. However, CAT score isn\u2019t the only deciding factor behind a candidate\u2019s chance to make it to a top management institute. Colleges also factor in the overall profile of the candidate, work experience, and even extracurricular activities,\u201d says Amit Poddar, Senior Regional Head, T.I.M.E, a CAT coaching institute spread across India.</p><p>Well, the path to success for an MBA aspirant is tough for sure, but not impossible. Here are the best expert strategies to help you inch closer to your dream B school.</p><p><strong>Understand CAT exam pattern and syllabus</strong></p><p>This is crucial for an MBA aspirant. You need to know your exam format and syllabus really well to plan your preparation strategy. CAT, which is an online exam, consists of three sections: Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC), Data Interpretation &amp; Logical Reasoning (DILR), Quantitative Aptitude (QA). \u201cThe duration of this MBA entrance exam is three hours, with 60 minutes allotted to each section. However, last year, the time span was cut short to two hours due to the COVID-19 crisis. The number of questions was also reduced and students had to wrap up each section within 40 minutes. But this year, we are expecting CAT to resume to its 3-hour format,\u201d says Poddar. You have to complete one section before moving on to the next. The questions are a combination of MCQs and non-MCQs.</p><p><strong>Start your preparation early on</strong></p><p>Each student is unique while it comes to strengths and weaknesses. So, the prep time also varies. \u201cFor an average student, approximately six to eight months of dedicated effort should be good enough for CAT preparation. But it is difficult for a graduation student to take this time out in the final year of graduation. So, we generally advise MBA aspirants to start preparation from the pre-final year of graduation,\u201d says Poddar.</p><p><strong>Make a section-wise preparation plan</strong></p><p>All the three segments of a CAT exam need equal attention and strategic planning. Here is how to ace them all.</p><p><em>Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC):</em> This section broadly is a combination of reading comprehension, grammar, vocabulary, and verbal reasoning. In this section all the questions revolve around paragraphs and passages. \u201cIn VA, students need to go create the summary of a paragraph. Then there are paragraphs with statements that don\u2019t fit in. Candidates need to find these odd statements out. Apart from these, there are jumbled paragraphs too. Here, students are asked to rearrange the statements in the best possible manner,\u201d says Poddar.</p><p>For RC, there are five passages generally. Candidates need to read and answer questions based on them. \u201cAll these require a lot of reading. So, one has to develop the habit of reading extensively. But a strong vocabulary and good grammar skills are necessary for successful reading and comprehension,\u201d says Poddar. According to him, these are the best tricks to strengthen one\u2019s vocabulary:</p><p>\u2022 Write 20 words with meanings every day.</p><p>\u2022 Resort to the root method. It allows you to identify the base of an unknown word, helping you guess the meaning intelligently.</p><p>\u2022 Read extensively and mindfully to develop the skill of contextual understanding. This is important because it\u2019s impossible to know the meaning of each and every word.</p><p>\u2022 Practise answering questions, passages and grammar regularly.</p><p><em>Data Interpretation &amp; Logical Reasoning (DILR):</em> This segment is a test of your analytical capacity and logical reasoning skill. DILR is an application-based section of the CAT exam. Most of the questions are based on puzzles, graphs and tables, requiring students to make arrangements and selections. \u201cSo, getting a strong hold on the concepts of different types of charts and tables is very important for this segment. Also, students need to interpret them well. Additionally, students need to master the technique of approximation to reach the answers quickly as some questions in DLIR are quite lengthy,\u201d says Poddar.</p><p><em>Quantitative Aptitude (QA):</em> This section challenges you with questions from Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry and Mensuration. \u201cFor this section, candidates have to sharpen their mental ability. Practise mathematics questions of class VIII, IX, X and XI and then move on to the tougher ones of the same type. Also, it\u2019s very important to understand the short cuts as there are a lot of fast ways to do the calculations,\u201d suggests Poddar. \u201cIf a student isn\u2019t confident about maths, then he or she should devote more time to QA than other subjects during CAT preparation,\u201d he adds.</p><p><strong>Practise model papers and take mock tests</strong></p><p>This will help you identify your strengths and weaknesses and sharpen your time management skills. \u201cWhile solving model question papers, make sure that you attempt a variety of questions on the same topic,\u201d suggests Poddar.</p><p>Mock tests are an important element in the preparation regimen of any exam, including CAT. \u201cDuring the six to eight months of preparation, students should aim at 20-25 of these tests. Stick to the sectional and overall time limit during the mock tests. Also, practise both the 40-minute and 60-minute time limits as the format of CAT isn\u2019t yet known.\u201d Analyse your mock test performance and work on the areas that need improvement.</p>"},
