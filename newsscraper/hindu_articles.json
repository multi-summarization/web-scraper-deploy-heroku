While it would give a short-term gain for the Congress and the UDF, the BJP would be happier, as it knows it could decimate the Congress any time. \u201cFor the BJP, defeating the Left is important, as it knows the Left is the galvanising force against the brand of politics practised by the BJP,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the plan would still be a non-starter given the fact that even if there were such arrangements between leaders of these fronts, it would be tough to translate them into action in all places.\n\nAnother Polit Bureau member S. Ramachandran Pillai said the LDF would doubtless coast to victory with a clear majority. \u201cOur reports suggest that the majority would be comfortable and if there was a wave, it could fetch up anywhere between 91 to 100 seats,\u201d he told The Hindu.\n\nFormer CPI(M) State secretary and Polit Bureau member Kodiyeri Balakrishnan earlier in the day told The Hindu that the Left front would get over 100 seats, as the \u201csecular people in minority communities, and they form the vast majority have lost their faith in the Congress and the UDF.\u201d\n\nHe contended that the BJP would probably get a vote share of 15 to 17%, but would draw a blank.\n\nHe said the CPI(M) would get fresh seats and recapture some of the seats its lost previously.\n\nLDF convenor A. Vijayaraghavan also exuded confidence about a win for the Left front but said nexus between the IUML and the BJP was evident in constituencies like Tirur. \u201cBut the LDF will outdo that,\u201d he said."},

(BMRCL), was on Tuesday appointed the new Economic Affairs Secretary. The appointment at the Centre came on the day BMRCL was carrying out a trial run on the eagerly-awaited extension of the Purple Line.\n\nMr. Seth, a 1987 batch Karnataka cadre IAS officer, had taken over the reins of BMRCL in July 2018 from Mahendra Jain. He has been credited with several milestones of Namma Metro. The latest was the launch of the extended Green Line on Kanakapura Road in January this year, bringing huge relief for a large number of residents near the 6-km line from Yelachenahalli to Silk Institute.\n\nLast July, tunnel work under Namma Metro Phase II was started after a long delay, with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa inaugurating the work at Cantonment Metro station. Under Phase II, the BMRCL plans to construct a 13.9-km underground line from Jayanagar Fire Station to Nagawara. The alignment will have 12 underground stations and 10.37 km of twin tunnels.\n\nLand acquisition for the airport line received a push during his tenure. In January 2019, the State government approved a plan to extend the metro from K.R. Puram to KIA via Nagawara, Hebbal. In November 2020, the BMRCL informed that it had acquired 59,103 square metres of land at a cost of \u20b9569 crore for the ORR line from Silk Board to K.R. Puram. For the K.R. Puram to KIA line, it is spending \u20b92,100 crore for 3.17 lakh square metres of land.\n\nMr. Seth was unavailable for comments.\n\nEarlier, in January 2018, 1985-batch Karnataka cadre IAS officer Pradeep Singh Kharola took over as the CMD of Air India when the government had started the process for its strategic disinvestment. He had been the managing director of BMRCL since February 2015.\n\nTrial run\n\nBMRCL began the trial run on the Mysuru Road-Kengeri extension on the Purple Line on Tuesday.\n\nThe BMRCL had planned to open the extended Green Line (Yelachenahalli to Anjanapura) on Independence Day (August 15) and the extended Purple Line (Mysuru Road to Kengeri) on November 1 (Karnataka Rajyostava) last year.\n\nHowever, the COVID-19 pandemic put the brakes on metro work, and most other infrastructure projects."},

According to the Left Democratic Front (LDF) leadership, Kollam is all set for a repeat of 2016 when the Left front won all the 11 Assembly segments in the district. \u201cThe welfare and development initiatives of the LDF government were well accepted by the voters. There was no anti-incumbency sentiment and the crowd at campaign meetings assures a resounding victory for the Left,\u201d said S. Sudevan, CPI(M) district secretary.\n\nThe United Democratic Front (UDF) camp is equally optimistic as they believe that the front will win 75% seats in the district. \u201cDespite having 11 MLAs and two Ministers, Kollam saw no comprehensive development in the past five years. This time the voters will rectify the mistake they made in 2016,\u201d said District Congress Committee president Punalur Madhu."},

They exercised their franchise en masse, putting aside their grouse over the failure of the authorities in realising their decades-long demand for a bridge across the Vamanapuram river that connected the Pullampara and Kallara grama panchayats.\n\nThe absence of the bridge has left the nearly 15 families in the colony and many more in the region with the plight of travelling long distances for their needs. Mr. Kumaran claimed that they had to travel over 15 kilometres via Muthuvila to reach Kallara. For this, they had to catch two buses to reach schools, hospitals and markets in Mithirmala, Kallara and other areas.\n\nFunds awaited\n\nWhile the government had accorded administrative sanction for a steel pedestrian bridge in Neermankadavu that would link the Kallara, Pullampara and Vamanapuram grama panchayats, work was yet to take off. Besides, the proposed project awaited funding.\n\nAccording to Pullampara grama panchayat member Sreekantan Nair, the colony dwellers have been provided the most basic amenities. Besides, many among them benefited through public institutions that functioned in the grama panchayat itself. While maintaining that the residents could travel to Thembamoodu nearby for their other needs, he concurred that the proposed bridge would provide them greater accessibility.\n\nWith the Public Works Department having submitted an estimate for the bridge, Mr. Nair expressed confidence that its construction would commence this year. Besides improving connectivity, the bridge would also enable the grama panchayat to do away with the existing ferry service across the Vamanapuram river that has created a huge financial burden on the local body."},

At close to 9 a.m., he arrived drenched in sweat at the single-teacher school in Podiyam, which serves as the polling booth to 440 people living in a clutch of tribal settlements in these forests.\n\n\"Hardly any road exists after this point. A few jeep services do run once in a while, but considering the condition of the roads, you might reach faster if you walk. Three years ago, we got power in our households, thanks to the total electrification programme, but the local ward members or the MLAs over the years have not taken any interest in making these roads motorable.

The report must indicate as to how many days of hospitalisation would be required before the patient is sent to the prison."},

The growth outlook for India however comes with significant downside risks because of the current pandemic wave the country is experiencing, IMF economists said.\n\nThe projections for India were based on evidence to support the normalization of economic activity but these forecasts preceded the current wave of COVID-19 in India, \u201c which is quite concerning,\u201d IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said at a press conference on Tuesday.\n\nThe current growth projections already take \u201c a fairly conservative view\u201d IMF economist Malhar Nabar said.\n\n\u201c But it\u2019s true that with this very worrying uptick in cases\u2026poses very severe downside risks tothe growth outlook for the economy,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter an estimated contraction of 3.3% in 2020 (calendar year), the global economy is expected to grow 6% this year and 4.4% next year, although there are significant divergences within and between countries. Projections for 2021 are slightly higher than they were in October 2020 due to fiscal support in some large economies and vaccine-supported recovery. The U.S.\u2019s 1.3 percentage point forecast upgrade, especially, contributed to this, resulting in U.S. growth projections of 6.4% and 3.5% this calendar year and next.\n\nThe U.S. GDP level in 2022 is forecast to be higher than in a non-pandemic scenario \u2013 the only large economy for which this is true. Other economies are also expected to rebound this year albeit at a slower rate, as per the IMF. The Euro Area is projected to grow at 4.4% and 3.8% over these time periods; China, at 8.4% and 5.6%.\n\nGlobal growth is projected to settle at 3.3% in the medium term due to damage inflicted on supply potential as well factors that pre-date the pandemic such as ageing (which has resulted in slower labour force growth in advanced economics and some emerging markets).\n\n\u201cRecoveries are also diverging dangerously across and within countries, as economies with slower vaccine rollout, more limited policy support, and more reliant on tourism do less well,\u201d Ms Gopinath said.\n\nAverting divergent outcomes would mean \u201cresolving the health crisis everywhere\u201d the report says. The average annual loss in per capita GDP over the 2020-24 period relative to pre-pandemic forecasts is expected to be 5.7% in low-income countries and 4.7% in emerging markets, For advanced economies, this number is a lower: 2.3%.\n\nPandemic pushed another 95 million into extreme poverty in 2020\n\n\u201cSuch losses are reversing gains in poverty reduction, with an additional 95 million people expected to have entered the ranks of the extreme poor in 2020 compared with pre-pandemic projections,\u201d Ms Gopinath said.\n\nPointing to uneven recovery within countries, Ms Gopinath wrote, the unskilled, young and women were more impacted.\n\n\u201cWomen have also suffered more, especially in emerging market and developing economies. Because the crisis has accelerated the transformative forces of digitalization and automation, many of the jobs lost are unlikely to return, requiring worker reallocation across sectors\u2014which often comes with severe earnings penalties,\u201d Ms Gopinath wrote in a blogpost accompanying the report.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is expected to \u2018leave smaller scars\u2019 than the 2008 financial crisis, due to the unprecedented policy response. However, emerging markets and low-income countries are expected to suffer more medium -term than their high income counterparts according to the IMF.\n\nGiven the large uncertainty surrounding the outlook, the report recommended that policymakers \u201cprioritize policies that would be prudent, regardless of the state of the world that prevails\u2014for instance, strengthening social protection with wider eligibility for unemployment insurance to cover the self-employed and informally employed.\u201d It also advocated adequate resources for healthcare, education, vocational training, early childhood development programs and investing in green infrastructure.\n\nThe report called for international cooperation, specifically to ensure adequate vaccine access globally, including by sufficiently funding COVAX, the international vaccine facility.\n\n\u201cThe international community also needs to work together to ensure that financially constrained economies have adequate access to international liquidity so that they can continue needed health care, other social, and infrastructure spending required for development and convergence to higher levels of income per capita,\u201d the IMF report said."},

He also noted that many believe Mr. Netanyahu is unfit to serve in light of his legal problems.\n\nNonetheless, he said that there was nothing in the law preventing Mr. Netanyahu from serving as prime minister and that after consulting with the 13 parties in the newly elected parliament, he believed that Mr. Netanyahu had the best chance of any candidate of forming a new government.\n\n\u201cNo candidate has a realistic chance of forming a government that will have the confidence of the Knesset,\u201d Rivlin said.

The Bone Season is set in 2059 in a world where clairvoyants hide their powers from the oppressive rule of Scion.\n\nPaige is a dreamwalker, a powerful clairvoyant, and works in the London criminal underworld. When she is drugged, kidnapped and imprisoned in Oxford, she realises there is a shadow government run by otherworldly beings, the Rephaim, who control Scion. Her jailor is an inscrutable Rephaite, Arcturus. The books following The Bone Season \u2014 The Mime Order (2015) and The Song Rising (2017) \u2014 follow Paige as she escapes from Oxford and starts a revolution. The recently released The Mask Falling (Bloomsbury), picks up the action in Paris.\n\nEmotional heart\n\nSamantha describes The Mask Falling as the heart of the series. \u201cIt is the middle point \u2013 the fourth book out of seven \u2013 but it also brings together everything I loved most about the first three books and sets up a few key mysteries for the last three. It is where some important threads are tied up while others continue into the second arc of the series. I also see it as the emotional heart, where I explore the relationship between Arcturus and Paige, arguably the backbone of the series, in more depth than ever before.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old author says the series is a marriage of her two favourite genres \u2014 dystopian fiction and epic fantasy. \u201cI call it an epic dystopia. Reading books like The Hunger Games or The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, I was always curious to know what was going on beyond that setting. In the Bone Season books, you can see the dystopia from multiple perspectives.\u201d\n\nHeart of darkness\n\nJack the Ripper is an important marker in the series. \u201cI\u2019ve been interested in the phenomenon of \u2018Rippermania\u2019 for a long time. I was taken on a walking tour in Whitechapel when I was quite young (probably too young) and the mystery has haunted me ever since. The alternate history of The Bone Season series begins in 1859, so I knew the timeline was going to cover the Ripper\u2019s reign of terror. I look for places to connect the real and the unreal, to ground the fantastical elements, and that seemed like a good one.\u201d\n\nConnecting the real and unreal calls for intensive research, which London-based Samantha says was fun. \u201cExploring Paris, which is my favourite city, is always a pleasure. I got to eat plenty of croissants. The linguistic aspect of The Mask Falling was a challenge, as I don\u2019t speak French. I had to rely on friends to translate the dialogue for me, and it took me a while to work out how to deal with the sexism built into the language, since Scion isn\u2019t a patriarchy.\u201d\n\nThe old Vic\n\nLanguage brings us to the slang of the clairvoyants, which is an adaptation of the speech of the London criminal underworld from the 18th and 19th centuries. Samantha says she did that because it is supposed to indicate that Scion is still being affected by an event that occurred during that period. \u201cA lot of 18th and 19th-century slang is such a treasure trove. I often look at the past for interesting, archaic words and phrases to weave into my work.\u201d\n\nThe pros of writing a series, according to the author, is spending time in one world with one cast of characters, allowing you to develop and layer them over several years. \u201cThat is such a joy and privilege. Paige and I have been able to grow up together. The main drawback is scheduling. You ideally want to get the books out as quickly as possible so readers can continue the story without having to wait for years, but that can be a challenge for slower writers.\u201d\n\nLove, not war\n\nWhile there are thrilling battles galore in the series, Samantha prefers writing love scenes. \u201cThey are a joy, especially when the two characters have a complex relationship. People are always surprised when I admit I can\u2019t stand writing action\u2013 I find it tedious.\u201d\n\nEngaging with readers on social media Samantha says is a boon and bane. \u201cIt has been a great comfort throughout the pandemic. It has kept me connected to the publishing industry while there haven\u2019t been any in-person events, and I love being able to hear from readers from all over the world.\u201d Samantha says, social media can, however, be distracting and panic-inducing if you scroll for too long. \u201cI would like to step back from it while I work on my next draft, but it is tough.\u201d\n\nThe four-year gap between The Song Rising and The Mask Falling, Samantha says because her editor had The Song Rising for a long time and she wrote the standalone fantasy, The Priory of the Orange Tree between the two instalments. \u201cIt ended up taking me far longer than I expected to edit, which affected The Mask Falling. I also had a bereavement in late 2019, my beloved grandmother passed away, which meant I missed a couple of important deadlines.\u201d\n\nListening in\n\nSamantha says she hasn\u2019t listened to many audiobooks. \u201cI find my concentration slips and I keep having to re-listen to sections. I am glad they exist, and I would like to get into them. I have listened to all Bone Season audiobooks and really enjoy Alana Kerr Collins\u2019 narration. She captures Paige\u2019s emotions very well.\u201d\n\nApart from the four novels in the series, there are also a couple of novellas set in the same universe. \u201cThe Pale Dreamer is a standalone prequel to the Bone Season series \u2013 the story of how Paige first earned her name in the criminal underworld of London. It will give readers a taste of the series and introduce them to some of its key characters. The Dawn Chorus is an in-depth exploration of Paige\u2019s trauma after a certain event in The Song Rising.\u201d\n\nA film based on The Bone Season was in initial development at 20th Century Fox. \u201cI have now realised it would be far stronger as a TV show. I\u2019m working with a British production company to bring that to fruition.\u201d\n\nFuture plans include another novel. \u201cAs soon as that is done, I will jump into the fifth Bone Season book.\u201d"},

It shows that the Muslim vote bank is slipping out of her hands. Had we said the same thing that all Hindus should unite, everybody would have criticised us. The EC would have sent us notices. We would have been censured,\u201d Mr. Modi said while addressing an election rally here.\n\nThe BJP on April 5 approached the Election Commission of India (ECI) seeking action against Ms. Banerjee, alleging she violated the Representation of the People\u2019s Act by asking Muslims to come together and vote for her party TMC in the state assembly polls.\n\nTaking a dig at Ms. Banerjee\u2019s comment, rhetorically questioning whether BJP leaders predicting the party\u2019s victory were Gods or superhumans, Mr. Modi said no one needs to be superhuman to predict BJP\u2019s victory as the wave in favour of the saffron camp spoke for itself.\n\n\u201cThere is no need to trouble God to find out who is losing and who is winning. Janata Janardhana [public], in the form of God, has given their response, it is known which way the wind is blowing,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDidi\u2019s exit is imminent. That is clear after the first two phases of polling,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Modi also claimed Ms. Banerjee had hurt Bengalis\u2019 self-esteem by alleging people come to his rallies for money.\n\nAccusing the TMC dispensation of indulging in rampant corruption, Mr. Modi said, \u201cDidi has started a new tax in Bengal - \u2018Bhaipo Service Tax\u2019!\u201d.\n\n\u201cFor ten years, women, Dalits, backward classes, farmers and tea workers were subjected to injustices, but you chose to be a mute spectator,\u201d he alleged, adding, that has led to a movement for change.\n\n\u201cSensing defeat, Didi has turned jittery and was criticising everybody and everything, from EC to EVMs,\u201d the Prime Minister said.\n\nReferring to some TMC leaders\u2019 claim that Ms. Banerjee might contest elections from his Lok Sabha seat Varanasi in 2024, Mr. Modi mocked the TMC boss, saying this proves that Ms. Banerjee has accepted her defeat and is looking for another seat.\n\n\u201cDidi is now looking for a place for herself outside Bengal,\u201d Mr. Modi said, who had won the Lok Sabha election twice from Varanasi in 2014 and 2019.\n\nMr. Modi asserted that Ms. Banerjee\u2019s claims that social schemes started by her will be stopped if BJP comes to power were \u201cfalse and baseless\u201d, and said none of them will be discontinued.\n\n\u201cIf anything is stopped, then that will be `Tolabaji\u2019 [extortion] and cut-money [bribes],\u201d he said."},

His journey from a junior artiste (Mazhavilkoodaaram, 1995) to one of the bankable stars in the industry has been nothing short of a dream run. Having emerged as a versatile actor, Joju is elated that he has some interesting films lined up for release.

He is a hefty character, literally and figuratively. I was at my heaviest, 132 kilogram, when I did the role!\u201d laughs Joju, adding that he is now trying to get back to shape.\n\nJoju George, Kunchacko Boban and Nimisha Sajayan in a still from \u2018Nayattu\u2019 | Photo Credit: Anup Chacko\n\nWithout revealing much about the plot, Joju says that Nayattu is a \u201csurvival movie\u201d, revolving around three police personnel, SI Maniyan (Joju), Praveen Michael (Kunchacko Boban) and Sunitha (Nimisha Sajayan) who are on the run. \u201cThe film also looks at the lives of policemen, up close and personal, an aspect that has been rarely explored in our cinema,\u201d he adds.\n\nNayattu is scripted by real-life cop, Shahi Kabir, who wrote the thriller, Joseph, which took Joju\u2019s career to new heights. He towered as the titular character, a retired police officer, who goes all out to unearth a crime. \u201cI was the first one to hear the story of Nayattu, when we were working on Joseph. I love Shahi\u2019s stories as I can easily connect with the emotions that he puts across. His characters are real and rooted\u2026 and their journey is phenomenal,\u201d says Joju.\n\nThe actor points out that Nayattu will be a project that Malayalam cinema will be proud about. \u201cA lot of effort has gone into the script, designing the plot, shooting location, choosing the cast\u2026There are many new faces who have given vibrant performances. Camera, editing, soundscape, music\u2026every department shines through,\u201d he says. This is his first work with Martin as an actor, although they have jointly produced films such as Charlie and Udaharanam Sujatha. \u201cWhen I asked him for a role in his directorial debut, ABCD, he said I was not ready! (laughs) I don\u2019t know whether I was in his mind when he heard the story of Nayattu. Since the film has been shot in sync sound, I haven\u2019t seen the film as a whole. But I am sure this will be a prestigious project in Martin\u2019s career; you can see his growth as a director,\u201d he adds.\n\nJoju George and Nimisha Sajayan in a still from \u2018Nayattu\u2019 | Photo Credit: Special arrangement\n\nJoju admits that he still has not come to terms with the fact that he is getting to share the screen with big names in Malayalam cinema. \u201cI\u2019m excited when I meet them. I often wonder if it was difficult for them to accommodate an artiste like me who came into cinema playing blink-and-you-miss kind of roles,\u201d he says.\n\nHe makes note of his recent release One, a political thriller, in which he plays Babychan, secretary of the ruling party and a classmate and close friend of Chief Minister Kadakkal Chandran, played by Mammootty. \u201cWhen I used to go from one film location to another looking for roles or as a junior artiste, I would watch Mammookka [Mammootty], Lalettan [Mohanlal] and other actors from a distance. I wouldn\u2019t dare to go near them. My friends used to come with me then. Many years later, after watching One, one of those friends told me that he had goosebumps when he heard me address Mammookka as \u2018eda\u2019 (Hey you) in a scene. Chackochan [Kunchacko Boban] was already a star when I met him the first time; he has always supported me.\u201d\n\nJoju\u2019s upcoming releases are Malik, Thuramukham, Pada, Star and Oru Thathwika Avalokanam. \u201cBesides intense characters, there are a couple of feel-good roles as well. There is Madhuram an out-an-out romantic tale directed by Ahammed Khabeer, director of June. It shows how love blooms in the lives of people of different age groups. In Peace, I play this carefree dad, who can\u2019t wait to get married again!\u201d\n\nJoju George and Kunchacko Boban in a still from \u2018Nayattu\u2019 | Photo Credit: Anup Chacko\n\nJoju is thrilled about his Tamil d\u00e9but in Dhanush-starrer Jagame Thanthiram, directed by Karthik Subbaraj and scheduled for an OTT release. \u201cIt is a larger-than-life character. The film happened because of Joseph and Chola (Alli in Tamil),\u201d says Joju. He is also part of Buffoon, also from Karthik\u2019s production house.\n\nMeanwhile, he keeps mum about his entry into Telugu industry. \u201cLet it be a surprise. It is a big budget project,\u201d he chuckles.\n\nHe is a two-time winner of Kerala State film awards \u2014 in 2015 he won special jury mention for Oru Second Class Yathra and Lukka Chuppi and in 2018 for best character actor for Chola and Joseph. \u201cIt feels good that now I can be choosy about my roles instead of doing every film that comes my way. I want to keep improving myself. I feel I ought to concentrate more and look further into nuances of the characters,\u201d he says.\n\nBefore signing off, Joju has advice for aspiring actors. \u201cI get messages saying they have been struggling for two or three years.

It could well settle some of the questions/issues that have come to define recent politics in the State.\n\nThe BJP may be seeking a second term for its first government in the northeastern State but the party went to the polls without announcing the incumbent Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal as its face for a second term. It\u2019s an acknowledgement of the importance of Himanta Biswa Sarma or HBS \u2014 the Minister who holds a number of portfolios, including Finance and Health, and is the face of the party in the northeast though he is number two in Assam. It is also a sign of a possible post-poll scenario if the BJP were to win.\n\nMr. Sarma, who joined the BJP in August 2015 from the Congress, occupied the same position under the late Tarun Gogoi in the Congress government. There was a time when his proximity to Mr. Gogoi created not only a wedge between the then Chief Minister and party veterans but also drove many of the old-timers out.\n\nKnown to be an efficient Minister and a hard taskmaster, Mr. Sarma has been harbouring an ambition for the top post since 2014, when the Congress, after faring poorly in the Lok Sabha poll, had toyed with the idea of replacing the Chief Minister and bringing in young blood.\n\nAs a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mr. Gogoi, HBS, who was 45 years old then, fit the description. He was also counting on senior Congressmen to deliver on their \u201cpromise\u201d of promoting him to the top post. But he is said to have hit a wall in Rahul Gandhi and the emergence of Gaurav Gogoi as an articulate Member of Parliament created more stumbling blocks.\n\nNow, seven years later and after having proven his utility in the rival party, the current election could define Mr. Sarma\u2019s future path.\n\nOn the other side of the divide, the Congress is struggling to fill the large shoes of Mr. Gogoi despite Assam being one of the few States where the Congress has an organisational presence in every block and every district.\n\nThe Congress, too, went with the collective leadership of State chief Ripun Bora, Lok Sabha member Debabrata Saikia, Lok Sabha MP Pradyut Bordoloi and Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, apart from Gogoi junior.\n\nThe result of the poll would surely have an impact on who leads the party in the State.\n\nNRC, CAA\n\nThe outcome of the poll could determine the direction of the debate around the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). While there is a view elsewhere that both the CAA and the Supreme Court-mandated exercise of updating the NRC are exclusionary processes, in Assam there is considerable support for the NRC and opposition to the CAA.\n\nThat explains why the Congress claims credit for piloting the NRC project while staunchly opposing the CAA since it discriminates on the basis of religion.\n\nEven the All India United Democratic Front and its leader Badruddin Ajmal \u201cwelcomed\u201d the NRC. Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Ajmal had argued that the NRC would finally put an end to the \u201cforeigner\u201d tag that many Bengali-speaking settlers have to endure in their day-to-day lives.\n\nThe issue of illegal immigrants \u2014 identified as undocumented migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh who came into the State after March 24, 1971 \u2014 has defined the State\u2019s politics for over 40 years now.\n\nWhile the original students\u2019 agitation (1979-1985) led by All Assam Students\u2019 Union (AASU) was largely bereft of religious identity and focussed more on cultural and linguistic differences, the movement translated into a more communally sharp politics.\n\nIf the Congress and the AIUDF have been charged with \u201cprotecting the migrants\u201d, the BJP has taken the debate to a different tangent by comparing the election to a fight between indigenous communities and invaders like the Mughals!\n\nMany intellectuals in Assam, however, argue that it is not one\u2019s faith but the fear of being \u201coutnumbered\u201d that drives the anti-CAA sentiments.\n\nRegional parties\n\nIt\u2019s this anger and fear against the CAA that gave rise to two new regional parties in the State: the Axom Jatiya Parishad and the Raijor Dal. This phenomenon is not new to the State where Assamese sub-nationalism defined the agitation of the late 70s and early 1980s. But for the past two decades, it has mostly been bipolar, with the BJP overshadowing earlier regional players like the Asom Gana Parishad.\n\nThe election could well decide the possibility of an alternative to the existing players in Assam\u2019s politics."},

It\u2019s now down to 21%. And the idea \u2026 that\u2019s bizarre. We were talking about a 28% tax that everybody thought was just fair enough for everybody,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe idea \u2026 here you have 51 or 52 corporations of the Fortune 500 haven\u2019t paid a single penny in taxes for three years.

Together, we can use a global minimum tax to make sure that the global economy thrives based on a more level playing field in the taxation of multinational corporations, and spurs innovation, growth, and prosperity,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to Ms. Yellen, one of the consequence of an interconnected world has been a 30-year race to the bottom on corporate tax rates.\n\n\u201cCompetitiveness is about more than how U.S. headquarters--headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger and acquisition bids. It\u2019s about making sure the governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises, and that all citizens fairly share the burden of financing government,\u201d she said.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the corporate tax rate being proposed is lower than it was in 2017.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s lower than it was from World War Two until 2017. So we are still proposing a rate that is lower than it has been for the vast majority of time,\u201d she said.\n\nIn her address to the Chicago Council, Ms. Yellen said a personal objective of her is to focus on America; international engagements on fostering full legal rights and greater economic and education opportunities for women and girls, given the clear evidence that this will support inclusive economic growth more broadly.\n\n\u201cSpeaking from my own experience, we need to do better at reducing barriers for women\u2019s economic empowerment, even unconscious ones, in nearly every country in the world, including the United States,\u201d she said.\n\nThe most evident immediate example is the need to address global health risks. COVID-19 has clearly shown that pandemic responses require global cooperation. \u201cWe\u2019re working with our partners to enhance pandemic preparedness against future shots. We need to learn lessons from this pandemic to be better prepared to stop future contagious diseases before they become full-scale pandemics,\u201d she said."},

But it is safe to say that the session I was in at the time was ruined because I couldn\u2019t focus,\u201d he chuckles.\n\nThe three songwriters, who still cannot believe the Academy Award nomination is real, reminisce over a video call with MetroPlus about the making of \u2018Husavik\u2019 and its rippling effect in a time of loneliness.\n\nSigrit\u2019s journey\n\nNetflix film Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga stars Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as members of an under-performing small-town Icelandic band Fire Saga, chosen by default to compete in the coveted Eurovision Song Contest on behalf of their country. The film also stars Dan Stevens, Pierce Brosnan, Demi Lovato and Mikael Persbrandt.\n\nThrough the film, many understood how much of a cult following the competition itself has. G\u00f6ransson says it was a huge part of his childhood.\n\nThat said, putting \u2018Husavik\u2019 together was no small feat, given the three songwriters almost played \u2018pass the parcel\u2019 as the song developed. The common mission was putting music to the journey of Sigrit (Rachel McAdams), instead of just creating a song about Eurovision. It was about getting into Sigrit\u2019s head and putting yourself on a mountain in Iceland, looking out and thinking about what life was like.\n\n\u2018Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\u2019 : Will Ferrell as Lars Erickssong, Rachel McAdams as Sigrit Ericksdottir | Photo Credit: Elizabeth Viggiano/NETFLIX\n\nThere were actually more than 60 versions of \u2018Husavik\u2019, including some with just guitar or piano. \u201cWe had the full song in Icelandic at one point, but no one would have understood it because we didn\u2019t even get that right,\u201d laughs Gsus.\n\nThe three, who have worked together on other projects over the years, agree there were \u201cno stupid ideas.\u201d G\u00f6ransson\u2019s jokes that one day, perhaps they will randomly release the Icelandic version but Gsus chimes in and says, \u201cmaybe for the Japanese DVD box collection!\u201d\n\nEarly on, the film\u2019s director David Dobkin and Kotecha knew this (\u2019Husavik\u2019) would be a key moment. Kotecha adds this was \u201cprobably the hardest one to crack, because it had to earn this comedic film an emotional ending. There wasn\u2019t the thought that this would carry the whole movie; it was important to just sum up the film and Sigrit\u2019s character arc.\u201d\n\n\u2018Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga\u2019 : Will Ferrell as Lars Erickssong, Rachel McAdams as Sigrit Ericksdottir | Photo Credit: Netflix\n\n\u201cThe song shaped the script and the script shaped the song,\u201d explains G\u00f6ransson, who is also known as the drummer for band Carolina Liar, \u201cWe knew we had to write it as a pop song and treat Sigrit as a pop star, writing songs from her perspective. We packed a lot of the story into the song. It was fantastic to see Rachel as she made it very credible. And yes, though it\u2019s a Will Ferrell comedy, there\u2019s still this deep story you can relate to. Creating an emotion like that is a gift and a dream. And who doesn\u2019t want to create music with Will Ferrell?\u201d\n\nAn emotional chord\n\nWhen the movie was released, Kotecha received messages from musician Charlie Puth and Frankie Grande (Ariana Grande\u2019s brother). The whole team was also bombarded by many on social media, about how \u2018Husavik\u2019 was an emotional experience for them.\n\n\u201cFrankie sent a voice note of himself saying the song would be his summer anthem, and even told me we would get an Oscar nomination, to which I said \u2018that\u2019s sweet of him\u2019,\u201d muses Kotecha, \u201cAnd he was right. The film brought the world laughter at a time when people were scared and stressed out, figuring out this pandemic. The message of the song and characters was all about what really matters: being at home with the ones you love. We did not think this would even happen when we were making it, we just assumed it would be a fun bunch of pop songs.\u201d"},

Jaishankar. Mr Lavrov said India and Russia are working for stability and connectivity in the Asia-Pacific and urged that \u201csecurity alliances\u201d should not come up in Asia.\n\n\u201cThe Taliban movement is a part of Afghan society. Decision on the settlement in Afghanistan should foresee the participation of all political, ethnic and religious groups in the country. Otherwise the solution will not be stable. This decision has to be based on balance of ethnic, political and religious interests, including in the legislative bodies,\u201dMr Lavrov said.\n\n\u201cAny exclusion of any group from this process will not lead to an implementable and sustainable agreement which can lead to resumption of hostilities, which is not the desire of the stakeholders,\u201d he said in response to a question after both the ministers issued press statements.\n\nDr. Jaishankar said there is a need to \u201charmonise\u201d the interests of various stakeholders that are active in and around Afghanistan.\n\n\u201cFor India, what happens in Afghanistan impacts our security directly. I shared our approach that for a durable peace there would require harmonising the interest of all - both within and around that country. The peace process should be based on foundational principles to which we all subscribe and a political solution should mean independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan,\u201d said Mr. Jaishankar.\n\nU.S. initiative\n\nMr Lavrov referred to the interaction between the Taliban and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration and urged for continued negotiation for peace.\n\n\u201cI will remind that the previous U.S. administration engaged the Taliban movement and created a window of opportunity to reach an agreement among all the hostile parties. As per the need to provide security in Afghanistan it depends on whether the settlement can take into account the political and security settlements,\u201d he said, emphasising that a sustainable solution to the Afghan war can be found under the \u2018Moscow format\u2019.\n\nApart from the Afghan situation, the major issue on the agenda for Tuesday's talks was expected to be the delivery of the Russian S400 missile defence system and the threat of U.S. sanctions that the delivery could attract. However, the ministers said the \u201cspecific\u201d issue did not come up during the discussion.\n\nHowever, Mr. Lavrov acknowledged that the U.S. exerts pressure on any country that wants to sign military and industrial contracts with Russia.\n\n\u201cWe did not discuss these response from the U.S. but we confirmed that we will deepen our military cooperation. We also discussed the prospects of manufacturing Russian military equipment under Make in India scheme,\u201d said Mr Lavrov. A diplomatic source however told The Hindu that \u201call issues\u201d were discussed between the two sides.\n\nSignificantly, the Indian membership in the Quad featured at the talks, according to Mr Lavrov.\n\nAnswering a question, Mr Lavrov indirectly took up the Quad and said he has heard of an \u2018Asian NATO\u2019 and \u2018Middle East NATO\u2019 and argued that Russia does not believe in the military alliance systems.\n\n\u201cToday we exchanged views on these. Our Indian friends have the same position. We are interested in inclusive cooperation which is for something and not against somebody,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Jaishankar said the India-Russia pharmaceutical collaboration has become \u201cmore serious\u201d during the pandemic. In response, Mr Lavrov informed, \u201cThe Russian Fund for Direct Investment has signed contract with various Indian manufacturers for Sputnik V vaccines for 700-750 million doses. This will become possible because of the manufacturing capacity in India.\u201d Both ministers also took up the possible export of the Covaxin to Russia which is likely to be cleared by experts.\n\nThe discussion also took up bilateral preparation for the annual summit between President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this year. Russia and India are also going to interact closely at various multilateral platforms like BRICS, and the UN where India is a non-permanent member at the Security Council."},

It comes as a capsule that's taken daily.\n\nUnlike nearly all other ADHD medicines, Qelbree is not a stimulant or a controlled substance, making it harder to abuse than older drugs. That's been a problem with earlier ADHD treatments like Ritalin, nearly all of which contain the stimulants amphetamine or methylphenidate.\n\nQelbree, developed by Supernus Pharmaceuticals of Rockville, Maryland, carries a warning of potential for suicidal thoughts and behavior, which occurred in fewer than 1% of volunteers in studies of the drug.\n\nPrice not disclosed\n\nSupernus wouldn't disclose the drug's list price, but it's sure to be higher than the many cheap generic ADHD pills.\n\nADHD affects about 6 million American children and adolescents. For many, problems include trouble paying attention and completing tasks, fidgeting and impulsiveness.\n\nExperts say the drug may appeal to parents who don't want to give their child stimulants.\n\nIt also could be an option for kids who have substance abuse problems, dislike the side effects of stimulants or need additional therapy, said Dr. David W. Goodman, director of Suburban Psychiatric Associates near Baltimore and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\n\nGoodman said most ADHD patients taking medication currently are prescribed long-acting stimulants, which are harder to to abuse to get a high than the original, fast-acting versions.\n\nIn a key late-stage study funded by Supernus, 477 children ages 6 to 11 took the drug for six weeks. Inattention and hyperactivity symptoms were reduced by about 50% compared to the placebo group. Qelbree, also known as viloxazine, helped reduce symptoms in some study volunteers within a week. Common side effects include sleepiness, lethargy, decreased appetite and headache.\n\nSupernus is in late-stage testing for adults with ADHD. That's a much smaller group than children, but that market is growing because few adults currently take ADHD medicines.\n\nViloxazine was sold as an antidepressant in Europe for several decades, but was never approved by the FDA. The maker ended sales for business reasons nearly two decades ago, as popular pills like Zoloft and Prozac came to dominate the market."},

Bulletstorm, for instance, was a first-person shooter with attacks that sent people flying, perhaps justifying the studio\u2019s unique name. Outriders is their wild attempt at the lucrative loot-shooter genre \u2014 which includes games such as Borderlands, Destiny and The Division.\n\nOutriders Developer: People Can Fly\n\nPeople Can Fly Publisher: Square Enix\n\nSquare Enix Price: \u20b93,499 on Nintendo Switch; \u20b93,999 on PC, Xbox Series and PlayStation PS4/PS5\n\nThe game has an extremely addictive shooter dynamics within a pretty good story. Humanity looks to planet Enoch after its mistakes destroy earth. You play as an Outrider, a highly trained soldier sent to scout and prepare the new planet for the rest of the colonists.\n\nBut a deadly energy storm kills your entire team and puts you in cryostasis. You wake up as an \u2018Altered\u2019, a mutated human with superpowers. And, you find yourself in the middle of another war. You face off against Enoch\u2019s monsters as well as factions of humans fighting over resources.\n\nScreenshot from \u2018Outriders\u2019 video game | Photo Credit: Square Enix\n\nOutriders has the plot of a blockbuster film. I wanted to go on several sidequests to explore the game\u2019s world and experience its action. The shaky camera on the cutscenes, however, is annoying. Thankfully, you can change the camera setting.\n\nThe game\u2019s action stands out. It borrows the best elements from several popular action games. Outriders is fast and frantic like Doom Eternal. And, you have the advantage of special powers. The game feels like Gears of War in both design and cover system, but there is also a distinct Mass Effect 3 vibe to it.\n\nScreenshot from \u2018Outriders\u2019 video game | Photo Credit: Square Enix\n\nFor your character, you can select from four distinct classes, each with its unique play-styles, strengths and weaknesses. The combination of gunplay and powers is great, but the cover system makes zero sense. The enemy AI is aggressive and is designed to keep you on your toes. They also cheat a bit. Hiding behind cover will automatically attract all their grenades, as they know where you are all the time. Additionally, the dodge button seems to have a mind of its own. On many occasions, I dodged the wrong way and one of the game\u2019s punishing Altered bosses made quick work of me.\n\nLet\u2019s go, co-op\n\nOutriders can be played solo by adjusting the difficulty tiers. But it is a game to be played with friends. In co-op, you can strategise and take down bosses effectively; encounters become a lot more fun. Though, at the time of writing this, there were many server down-times and game crashes on PC.\n\nScreenshot from \u2018Outriders\u2019 video game | Photo Credit: Square Enix\n\nThe game\u2019s core mechanics are strong with great animations but things feel a bit inconsistent. This is especially evident in the sound design. On some battles, it feels as if a bunch of kids put \u2018pew-pew\u2019 and \u2018tew-tew\u2019 fighting sounds in the game. Oddly, factors such as distance did not affect the sound. So, a gatling gun-wielding enemy, who is afar, sounds like he is right in front of me.\n\nWhile Outriders has a few rough edges, People Can Fly has done what EA, Bethesda and Crystal Dynamics struggled to do with Anthem, Fallout 76 and Avengers. It is a fun game with addictive gameplay mechanics and a decent story. Play it with your friends to make the most of it.\n\nThe writer is a tech and gaming enthusiast who hopes to one day finish his sci-fi novel"},

This model is made of CNC aluminium which sees the device carrying quite lightly, ideal for those sick of work-from-home and want to take the meetings and deadlines to a caf\u00e9 or a friend\u2019s place.\n\nOur review device was the Frost exterior that comes with an Arctic White glass fibre composite around the keyboard and trackpad, allowing for a comfortable grip and resting position for your palms.\n\nThe 13.4-inch display on the XPS 13 9310 is, as usual, eye-catching and not too high-contrast. Does it match up to the M1 MacBook\u2019s displays? It comes pretty close, thanks to the Intel Iris Xe\u2019s transformational GPU and integrated graphics that promise to support richer gaming experiences and greater speed for designers and creators.\n\nChipset: 11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 Processor\n\n11th Generation Intel Core i5-1135G7 Processor Video card: Intel Iris Xe Graphics\n\nIntel Iris Xe Graphics Display: 13.4\u201d FHD+ (1920 x 1200) InfinityEdge, non-touch anti-glare 500-nit display\n\n13.4\u201d FHD+ (1920 x 1200) InfinityEdge, non-touch anti-glare 500-nit display\n\n\n\nMemory: 512GB M.2 PCIe NVMe Solid State Drive\n\nDisplay size matters; the 500-nit (of brightness) screen\u2019s 16:10 aspect ratio makes for comfortable viewing thanks to there being more vertical space; when laptop screen ratios seem off-balance, this can affect how the user takes in information. In fact, this 91.5% screen-to-body ratio is known as \u2018a sweet spot\u2019 given it is ideal for both streaming and productivity. Goodbye, annoying black bars and weird bezels!\n\nOne of the most under-discussed aspects of a display is backlight bleed, when the display\u2019s light leaks around the edges of your screen, making it unevenly lit. This, too, can affect the viewing comfort and more laptop manufacturers are waking up to this as more users become more cognizant of this odd phenomena. Thankfully, the XPS 13 9310 does not have such noticeable backlight bleed, but you may catch a glimpse of it in low-light settings, so do not use this device in complete darkness.\n\nThe Dell XPS 13 9310 has a 3.5 mm headphone/microphone combo jack and Thunderbolt 4 on one side | Photo Credit: Divya Kala Bhavani\n\nThe touchscreen is a handy add-on, transforming the laptop into a wholly interactive device. But at the start of use, the touchscreen was not too responsive for me, so I merely adjusted my reliance on this feature. The Gorilla Glass 6 gives off a reflective and glossy finish which can be a trial to keep fingerprint-free if you are like me and are constantly distracted by every little smudge.\n\nThe battery of the XPS 13 9310 is impressive; I was able to get 16 hours of productivity out of a single full charge while gaming got a good 10 hours. My first uses ended up causing quite a bit of overheating to the point of discomfort but there are some energy distribution settings one can calibrate to amend this. Dell has purposefully invested more in performance and display here, making it one of the best Windows 10 ultrabooks out there.\n\nI have always appreciated Dell\u2019s keyboard designs; in the case of the XPS 13 9310, the chiclet keyboard is quite comfortable and has smooth key travel as well as intuitive feedback. All these factors make for better productivity The trackpad is responsive and has a decent precision to it too.\n\nAn HD issue?\n\nUnfortunately, Dell still has not listened to the mass cries of its consumer base around its grainy camera. There is only a slight improvement in the XPS 13 9310\u2019s built-in webcam. However, in several different video calls, my webcam-captured self looked like variants of a Van Gogh painting. Given the webcam is located within the frame itself, it is easy to get your fingerprint smudge on there; before your video calls, give it a good wipe with a microfibre cloth.\n\nThe Dell XPS 13 9310 has a sturdy hinge | Photo Credit: Divya Kala Bhavani\n\nSome users may have to dish out extra cash for a HD webcam as well as a small ring light to keep themselves video call-ready.\n\nSetting buyers back by \u20b91,50,990, the device better come with some decent support. Dell India has prompt servicing and you can look forward to pan-country help, wherever the glitches may happen. The Dell XPS 13 9310 is a great ultrabook but there are some great high-performance options in the market costing under one lakh, such as from Asus, Dell, HP and Apple.\n\nIf you are to opt for this Dell XPS 13 9310, do it with your all and be ready for all that comes your way, because this is one that will occupy your workspace for at least the next two to three years."},

That familiar knot in your stomach signals the impending arrival of exams, sleepless nights and caffeine overdose. Here are a few things you can do to help yourself:\n\nGet organised: Working backwards helps. If your exams are scheduled for May, make a schedule for revision and for practice. Sit with your subject teachers and plan your revision keeping in mind the date of the exam. Create a schedule by breaking it down into tiny chunks. But also make sure you have spare time to relax and unwind.\n\nMind your space: Blending our physical spaces is one of the biggest blunders. This has become more relevant now that we are all home bound. We work from homes, study in our bedrooms, eat on the bed and probably use the study table to dump stuff! It is important to respect the space so even your mind can dissociate. Designate an area where you will do all your studying and revising.\n\nExercise and eat a well-balanced diet: When you\u2019re under a lot of stress, exercising may seem like the last thing you want to do. But this guarantees that you will feel better later. It is also important to eat the right food during these high stress moments for mental health and wellness.\n\nYour phone can wait: Put your phone away while you are studying. The distraction of notifications from friends and checking Instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms is the worst kind of procrastination. A bit of unchaining from the phone can do wonders for your stress levels.\n\nMock exams at home: One of the commonest causes for exam anxiety is lack of information about what to expect on the day of the exam. The best way to deal with this is practice and more practice. Time your at-home mocks. If you have trouble finishing on time, keep practising until you have nailed the timings. Seek feedback from your teachers. They can help you figure out which what areas can be improved further.\n\nBut remember, that success in the exam does not determine who you are. Everyone reacts differently in different circumstances. An exam just quantifies your knowledge. Put your worries and stress into perspective and you will be able to face the exams head on.\n\nThe writer is Activities and Events Coordinator and Spanish Teacher at Aditya Birla World Academy."},

You can subscribe for free here\n\nThe six-part limited series, hosted by Will Smith, follows the history of how the 14th Amendment \u2014 a part of the American Constitution still not fully understood by the majority \u2014 catalysed freedom fights, from Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King Jr to Gloria Steinem, Ruth Bader Ginsberg and President Barack Obama. Amend also brims with archival footage, photographs, rendered animations and emotive narrations from academics such as historian Christopher Bonner, University of Maryland, and Prof Joanna Grossman, SMU Dedman School of Law.\n\nScoring for the project proved a complex experience for Essed, whose name is attached to documentaries such as Finders Keepers (2015), Emmy-winning Jim: The James Foley Story (2016), and Peabody-winning True Justice: Bryan Stevenson\u2019s Fight For Equality (2019).\n\nOver a video call the New York-based composer says, \u201cThere were so many moving parts and because there were four producers, there were a lot of conversations. Everyone working on Amend put so much of themselves into it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Everyone has a stake\u2019\n\nWhen Essed first signed on, there was talk of Will Smith being involved but as scoring and production progressed, other big names such as Mahershala Ali, Randall Park, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Yara Shahidi and Willow Smith joined the project. \u201cEveryone has a stake in the subject matter and the outcome, especially because the conversation around the 14th Amendment is not done,\u201d he insists. As a composer, he believes within the documentary space, his responsibility goes beyond just scoring \u2014 he is a part of the storytelling.\n\nRandall Park on the set of Netflix limited series \u2018Amend: The Fight for America\u2019 | Photo Credit: Netflix\n\nDue to the contemplative nature of the show, Essed leveraged restraint as a powerful tool to pull off a score that further immersed audiences. But he says this was liberating and he was able to experiment to stay within the parameters he set for himself. \u201cI just had to react to the dramatic arc of the stories,\u201d he explains, \u201cand we all had strong ideas about creating this in an honest way. I also had to be mindful, given the evolving diversity of America through these years, of how the music suited a certain group being represented, for example, with Operation Wetback [immigration law enforcement initiative created by Joseph Swing] and the Chinese Exclusion Act, we had to allow for the soundscape to react to these events, but subtly so. It still had to come from an American place which was just more truthful.\u201d\n\nIndia-made projects Essed also pitched in his skills for Academy Award-winning short documentary Period: End Of Sentence (2019). \u201cSeeing that kind of recognition of that scale, and watching the film and how it came together was wonderful,\u201d he comments. \u201cWorking a documentary, you don\u2019t get many opportunities to tell joyful stories that don\u2019t end up feeling like a commercial for something. But this is such a joyful story.\u201d\n\nThe series comprises a fair bit if source music as well, and Essed had to interact instinctively with these sounds. \u201cThe source music has its role, and as we transition through the series, we understand where we have to move on from it while treating those music pieces with respect and gentleness,\u201d he points out.\n\nSometimes, there is not even any score for certain scenes. \u201cThe most effective scores allow plenty of room for silence. There are so many pivots in this score, especially in two-minute sections. Taking breaths in between these dense moments is so important so that things can sink in,\u201d Essed points out.\n\nIn Amend, there are rendered animated visuals and scoring for those was an interesting process for Essed, \u201cIt was unique to dive into those sections which came later. When you\u2019re scoring for these different mediums (photographs, animations, explainers), you have to see what the filmmaker\u2019s vision is as well. You have to leave room for a lot of openness when you are scoring for something that is developed at the same time as your inputs.\u201d\n\nComposer Osei Essed\n\nWhen it comes to composing for films versus series, Essed says \u201cin a series, there are more bursts and switches between tones in short periods of time. In film, most of the stuff I have done has a bit more space.\u201d\n\nAsk Essed which iconic composer of the past would have been a great composer for a series like Amend and he responds, \u201cFrom an American point-of-view, it would be interesting to have a blend of Duke Ellington with perhaps Miles Davis. I wouldn\u2019t go back very far because storytelling has changed so much. If they were thrown into the modern day, they would probably ask \u2018what is going on?\u2019 But those guys could definitely rock it.\u201d\n\nEssed is thankful that Amend was released on a global OTT platform so that audiences can delve into simultaneous conversations about race, gender, immigration, freedom and more on an international scale. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling to know the true reach of it. Watching Amend for the first time as a finished product was amazing. Working in the documentary space, this series has some seriously well-reputed academics who I\u2019ve seen across other works, but here they are in one project,\u201d laughs Essed. Even more so, having been born in South America and being part of an immigrant family, he feels even more connected with the series."},

Pant along with Marcus Stoinis and Shimron Hetmyer or Sam Billings will look to fill the hole left by Iyer in the middle order.\n\nThe addition of Steve Smith will further bolster their batting.\n\nDhawan (618) was the second highest run-scorer in 2020 and looked in good touch in the recent ODI series against England with scores of 98 and 67.\n\nShaw too will be itching to prove his worth after amassing 827 runs in the Vijay Hazare Trophy following his ouster from the Australia Test series and a dismal last season.\n\nPant has emerged as a match-winner for India in the recent series against Australia and England. He along with all-rounder Stoinis and Billings will have to ensure that DC finish with a flourish.\n\nOn the bowling front, South African pace duo of Kagiso Rabada (2020 purple cap winner) and Anrich Nortje has proved to a dream pair, having scalped 52 wickets together in 2020.\n\nWith Chris Woakes also in the mix this time and Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav also in the ranks, Delhi have options in their pace battery.\n\nWEAKNESS: Delhi's primary weakness is not having enough quality players in their ranks both overseas and home cricketers. Not having like-for-like replacements is one of the weak points.\n\nIt was precisely the reason they were not able to rest Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje. Even in terms of wicket-keeping, in case Pant has a niggle they didn't have replacement. This year they have Vishnu Vinod of Kerala but he is a green horn.\n\nAlso the Indian fast bowling is pretty weak as their two premier fast bowlers Ishant and Umesh don't play much white ball cricket for the national team now.\n\nOPPORTUNITIES: Although a big challenge, but it will also be a huge opportunity for young skipper Pant to step out of the shadows of the legendary MS Dhoni by guiding his team to its maiden title.\n\nThe league also provides Pant the opportunity to prepare for the T20 World Cup, where he will be a vital cog in India's batting line-up. Dhawan too will look to seal the opening slot, while it is also a chance for R Ashwin and Axar Patel to prepare for the ICC event.\n\nTHREAT: Pant has displayed resilience and understanding in his short career thus far but he will have to ensure that the added leadership responsibility doesn't affect his natural attacking instinct as a batsman.\n\nAlso DC's pace unit is too dependent on Rabada and Nortje with back-up pacers Ishant and Umesh not boasting of a great T20 record.\n\nLast year, Delhi suffered four successive losses after seven wins in first nine games, jeopardising their play-off chances.

The technicolor streaks of darting tropical fish flash less frequently. The rasping sounds of lobsters go quiet.\n\nWhile Cuba\u2019s marine life has suffered from overfishing and pollution, there is mounting evidence that the warming of waters due to climate change may be taking a large toll as well \u2014 both off the island\u2019s coast and globally.\n\nResearch published Monday finds that the total number of open-water species declined by about half in the 40 years up to 2010 in tropical marine zones worldwide. During that time, sea surface temperatures in the tropics rose nearly 0.2\u2103.\n\n\u201cClimate change is already impacting marine species diversity distribution,\u201d with changes being more dramatic in the Northern Hemisphere where waters have warmed faster, said study co-author Chhaya Chaudhary, a biogeographer at Goethe University.\n\nWhile numerous factors like overfishing have impacted tropical species, the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found a strong correlation between species decline and rising temperature. Fish species diversity tended to either plateau or decline at or above 20\u2103, the researchers found.\n\n\u2018Blink of an eye\u2019\n\nWhile past studies have shown that ocean warming is driving some species to migrate to cooler waters, the new study attempts to gauge that impact more broadly \u2014 analyzing data on 48,661 marine species including fish, mollusks, birds and corals since 1955.\n\nThe dataset is a representative sample of 20% of all named open-water and seabed-dwelling marine species - like corals and sponges, researchers said.\n\nThe number of species attached to the seafloor remained somewhat stable in the tropics between the 1970s and 2010, according to the study. Some were also found beyond the tropics, suggesting they had expanded their ranges. In other words, scientists say, species that can move are moving.\n\n\u201cIn geological history, this has occurred in the blink of an eye,\u201d said Sebastian Ferse, an ecologist at the Leibniz Centre for Tropical Marine Research who was not involved with the study. \u201cTo see such changes occurring so rapidly is something quite alarming.\u201d\n\nFor fixed species like corals, moving is not an option.\n\n\u201cOne of the big questions is \u2018Will coral reefs as ecosystems and corals as species be able to move north or south enough fast enough to adjust to a changing climate?\u2019\u201d Ferse said.\n\nHaving fleets of fish and other swimmers shift rapidly to more temperate waters could devastate the coral ecosystems they leave behind \u2014 along with any fishing and tourism industries that rely on them.\n\nSuch changes \u201ccan have a really huge impact on some of the most vulnerable human communities around the planet,\u201d said Stuart Pimm, a conservation scientist at Duke University not involved in the study.\n\nFor Cuba, such an impact could unravel the island nation\u2019s efforts to manage its underwater gardens although its corals have been less stressed by coastal development and pollution than corals elsewhere. They are considered more resilient to ocean warming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impressive to return to an area that experienced significant bleaching the year before, but looks perfectly healthy a year later,\u201d said Daniel Whittle, who heads the Caribbean program at the Environmental Defense Fund.\n\nCuba opened its first coral reef nursery four years ago to research which species coped best with warming and eventually to repopulate depleted reefs. The country is also restoring coastal mangroves, which serve as fish nurseries and shelter.\n\nChaudhary and her colleagues plan next to look at which tropical species were in decline or were migrating."},

He held a series of brainstorming sessions with the State leadership up to the district levels.\n\nIt was followed by a rigorous training session that was helmed by Mr. Baghel\u2019s team for booth-level workers in 115 constituencies spread over 22 days, reaching out to nearly 1,000 Congress workers in each of these sessions. The Congress is contesting only 93 seats here. The training programme included analysing the 2016 results down to the booth level.\n\nMain challenge\n\nThe main challenge for Mr. Baghel\u2019s team members, who have been stationed in Assam for three months now \u2014 including his political advisor Vinod Verma, media advisor Ruchir Garg and All India Congress Committee Secretary Rajesh Tiwari \u2014 is to motivate the Congress in the State.\n\nIn 2016, they were down to 26 seats and further attrition over five years meant that there were only 20 legislators remaining in the Congress stables. The difference in vote share between the Congress and the BJP in 2016 was more than 10%.\n\nNext to the Assam Pradesh Congress headquarters of Rajiv Bhawan, Hotel Gateway has practically turned into Chhattisgarh Bhavan, with ministers, MPs, legislators and other leaders camping here.\n\nBut what did the Chhattisgarh team teach Assam, with its deep ethnic faultlines? Mr. Verma says basic \u201celectioneering\u201d is State agnostic.\n\nWhile his associates have been busy building the team, Mr. Baghel has emerged as one of the key campaigners in the State. From February 7 onwards, when the Congress campaign began in the State, he has attended 38 political events. Of the 38 events, 23 public meetings, two interactions with the Congress cadre and one roadshow were held in upper Assam, a region the Congress had all but given up on.\n\nIn 2016, out of the 35 seats in the region, which went to the polls in the first phase, the Congress won only five. Team Chhattisgarh made Dibrugah its headquarters, functioning out of there for more than two months, before shifting base to Guwahati.\n\nAt a public meeting in Barpeta, Mr. Baghel addresses the crowd in brisk Hindi, talking about stock issues such as inflation, fuel price hike, unemployment. The crowd listens passively but when he switches to Ahomiya saying \u201cCAA Ami Namanu\u201d (\u2018We will not accept CAA\u2019), the crowd roars back.\n\n\u201cMy job here is basically to energise the workers, listen to them and give whatever support we can from our experience of fighting the BJP in a State where they ruled for 15 years,\u201d Mr. Baghel says.\n\nThe bottom-up approach, Mr. Baghel says, helps resolve differences. The fact that candidate selection is made in Assam, not sitting miles away, has made a difference. \u201cThe Chhattisgarh model is a shining example that the Congress delivers on its electoral promises,\u201d he adds.\n\nHe says he is confident that the Congress will sail through. The Assam leadership also acknowledges the role Chhattisgarh has played in the State.\n\n\u201cMr. Baghel has played the role of a mentor. He sent a team of party workers who were dedicated and worked at the level of the booths. In Assam, we have the strongest party organisation, but we did realise that, as compared to our opponent, we were weak in booth management. And I think the Chhattisgarh unit helped in this grass roots outreach,\u201d senior Congress leader and Assam MP Gaurav Gogoi notes."},

As these birds \u2018pass through a narrow window of time\u2019, there are not many records of them from these parts\n\nFrom this writer\u2019s interactions with him, Chennai-based birder Sundaravel Palanivelu measures his words as carefully as a surveyor measures disputed land. One gets the sense of an internal machine turning and sifting through thoughts before elevating any of them to the dignity of speech. Even in his online interactions, he is an exemplar of brevity.\n\nSo, when his sentences reach two-digit world lengths, the rare verbal extravagance is usually justified. Recently, he had had two bird sightings to discuss; and together, they were too remarkable to keep it laconic. The two sightings were barely separated by time and space.\n\nOn the morning of April 3, he had seen a Large-billed Leaf Warbler and a Western Crowned Warbler. Passage migrants in these parts, these warblers are rarely recorded because of the narrow time-frame available to see them. (Entered in eBird, both sightings have been approved by the documentation-platform for avian observations).\n\nThe highlight is that both showed up that morning at Sundaravel\u2019s living space, SaiSurya Apartments in Pallikaranai. Sundaravel\u2019s apartment roughly falls within the route for onward and reverse migration taken by both these warblers. Besides, Sundaravel\u2019s homestead is within shouting distance from a section of the Pallikaranai Marsh. However, these factors do not detract from the rarity of the sightings. Here\u2019s why.\n\nWhen this writer had earlier sought his views about these two warblers\u2019 migration route and their occurence-frequency, this is what ornithologist V. Santharam had to say: \u201cThe Western Crowned Warbler and Large billed Leaf Warbler are passage migrants: Both seem to be passing through the East Coast. These birds come to Western Ghats and some of them passing through Chennai would be heading to Sri Lanka. There are not many records of these birds; that is because they pass through a very narrow window of time. Their movements (on the onward migration) happen when NE monsoon has set in and so, not many people would be venturing out. In their reverse migration in March and April, relatively more people may see it. I have seen the large-billed leaf warbler at GNP.\u201d\n\nA Western Crowned Warbler sighted in the greenery at an apartment complex in Pallikaranai on April 3, 2021. The crownstripe is a diagnostic feature of the Western Crowned Warbler. Photo: Sundaravel Palanivelu\n\nCalling the Western Crowned Warbler an eBird rarity, Vikas Madhav Nagarajan, eBird reviewer, was on the same page, concluding that while \u201cSouth-western ghats is where the Western Crowned Warbler winters\u201d, there is the probable explanation that a population of this warbler \u201cpasses through Chennai and the East Coast on the way to Sri Lanka.\u201d\n\nWith Sundaravel\u2019s April 3, 2021 sighting of Western Crowned Warbler being entered in eBird under category of Chennai district, it becomes the second photographic record of the bird in this region. On April 23, 2016, Vikas had a photographic record of the Western Crowned Warbler in Guindy National Park.\n\nSantharam points out that with collation of eBird data, the movements of rarely-seen passage migrants can be better tracked, filling the gaps in the understanding of possible passage routes. Says the ornithologist: \u201cNow, with eBird data you should be able to see the migratory pattern. If there are sufficient records, it should be possible to do mapping and animation-based depiction of bird movement.\u201d"},

Click here to subscribe for free.)\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court handed Alphabet Inc's Google a major victory on Monday, ruling that its use of Oracle Corp's software code to build the Android operating system that runs most of the world's smartphones did not violate federal copyright law.\n\nIn a 6-2 decision, the justices overturned a lower court's ruling that found Google's inclusion of Oracle's software code in Android did not constitute a fair use under U.S. copyright law.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer, writing for the majority, said that allowing Oracle to enforce a copyright on its code would harm the public by making it a \"lock limiting the future creativity of new programs. Oracle alone would hold the key.\"\n\nOracle and Google, two California-based technology giants with combined annual revenues of more than $175 billion, have been feuding since Oracle sued for copyright infringement in2010 in San Francisco federal court. Google had appealed a 2018 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington reviving the suit.\n\nThe ruling spares Google of a potentially massive damages verdict. Oracle had been seeking more than $8 billion, but renewed estimates went as high as $20 billion to $30 billion,according to two people with knowledge of the situation.\n\nKent Walker, Google's senior vice president of global affairs, called the ruling a victory for consumers and computer interoperability.\n\n\"The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit consumers,\" Walker said.\n\nOracle's lawsuit accused Google of plagiarising its Java software by copying 11,330 lines of computer code as well as the way it is organised, to create Android and reap billions of dollars in revenue. Android, for which developers have created millions of applications, now powers more than 70% of the world's mobile devices.\n\nGoogle has said it did not copy a computer program butrather used elements of Java's software code needed to operate a computer program or platform. Federal copyright law does not protect mere \"methods of operation.\"\n\nThe companies also disputed whether Google made fair use of Oracle's software code, making it permissible under the copyright law.\n\nDorian Daley, Oracle's executive vice president and general counsel, said that with the ruling \"the Google platform just got bigger and market power greater\" and \"the barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower.\"\n\n\"They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can. This behavior is exactly why regulatory authorities around the world and in the United States are examining Google's business practices,\" Daley said.\n\nThe Justice Department sued Google on Oct. 20, accusing the $1 trillion company of illegally using its market muscle to hobble rivals, in the biggest challenge to the power and influence of Big Tech in decades.\n\nShares in Oracle and Alphabet each rose 3.6% percent in midday trading.\n\n'Anything but fair'\n\nIn Monday's ruling, Breyer wrote, \"Google's copying was transformative,\" adding that the company repurposed Oracle's code in a way that helps developers create programs.\n\nThe ruling sidestepped the question over whether Oracle's code was entitled to copyright protection in the first place.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, said the court should have found that Oracle's work deserved a copyright and Google's use was \"anything but fair.\"\n\nNoting that Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp did not resort to copying like Google to create mobile operating systems, Thomas said the ruling will harm competition.\n\nIf \"companies may now freely copy libraries of declaring code whenever it is more convenient than writing their own, others will likely hesitate to spend the resources Oracle did to create intuitive, well-organised libraries that attract programmers and could compete with Android,\" Thomas wrote.\n\nThe case has whipsawed since the start, with Google twice losing at the Federal Circuit. In 2014, that appeals court reversed a federal judge's ruling that Oracle's interfaces could not be copyrighted. The Supreme Court in 2015 rebuffed aprevious Google appeal in the case.\n\nA jury cleared Google in 2016, but the Federal Circuit overturned that decision in 2018, finding that Google's incorporation of elements of Oracle's \"application programming interfaces\" was not permitted under the so-called fair use doctrine of the 1976 Copyright Act, rejecting Google's argument that by adapting them to a mobile platform it transformed them into something new.\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett did not participate in the ruling.

Simply because we believe in different political ideologies does not mean that we have to be at each other's throat all the time. Elections come only every five years but we have to co-exist all the time,\" said P.G. Thampy, a LDF activist.\n\nDelphin Antony, a Vongress worker in the UDF camp, could not agree more. \"Elections here have always been peaceful since we all know that we have to see each other even after elections. Politics need not interfere with your personal relations,\" he said.\n\nThat camaraderie apart, the competition remains intense and neither side was willing to compromise for the victory of their respective candidates.\n\n\"UDF candidate Tony Chammany will make it through though Twenty20 may inflict some dent in its voter base in areas like Chellanam. But that should be more than made up through the votes we secure elsewhere,\" said Mr. Antony.\n\nMr. Thampy on his part was confident of LDF candidate and sitting MLA K.J. Maxy's victory though he said that the prediction that Twenty20 would eat into UDF vote alone could be a misplaced observation.\n\nNeither side, interestingly, made any comment about the other apolitical outfit in the fray V4 People and its candidate Nipun Cherian.\n\n10.35 am\n\nOver 21% voter turnout in first 3 hours\n\nContinuing the brisk pace of polling, Kerala has registered a voter turnout of 21.43% in the first three hours of the Assembly elections.\n\n23.79% of male voters, 19.22% of women voters and 4.49% of transgender voters exercised their franchise by 10.30 a.m., according to official updates.

Although the teaching learning assessment has to be critically evaluated, the change may be here to stay.\n\nLate last month, the University Grants Commission issued a notice that institutions could offer up to 40% of courses in a particular programme in a semester through the online learning platforms such as Swayam. At the same time, the Consortium for Educational Communication signed an agreement with the University of Madras to develop multimedia course content.\n\nSenior academicians say the pandemic had opened new avenues that the National Education Policy had envisaged. \u201cThe UGC advisory is in tune with the NEP in its attempt to raise the standards of online education programmes. But it may be in a phased manner,\u201d said S.P. Thyagarajan, Chancellor of Avinashilingam University.\n\nThe UGC guidelines cannot be directly adopted by universities which were governed by statutory bodies, he said. The benefit was that the students would have access to talented teachers from across the country, he said.\n\nUniversities have to strengthen their infrastructure, e-resources and its faculty before launching online programmes.\n\nThe UGC\u2019s recommendation would at best give avenue for the first stage of activity, he said. \u201cWe will have to take the stakeholders\u2019 feedback, including teacher and student fraternity and critically evaluate the outcome of the quality of these programmes,\u201d Prof. Thyagarajan said.\n\nUniversity Grants Commission\u2019s former Vice-Chairman H. Devaraj flagged the issue of quality. \u201cIn an online class, who will monitor the students or the quality of the courses,\u201d he asked.\n\nEven in programmes offered under National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) by the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT-M), less than 8% of those who enrol completed the course, he said.\n\nThe data provided by the IIT-M, which has developed over 2,000 courses by talented teachers, is a pointer. Under the MOOCs format, the IIT-M offered 2,467 courses in the last seven years and 1.24 crore candidates had enrolled.

He confirmed that the government will test out a contentious \u201cvaccine passport\u201d system \u2014 a way for people to offer proof they have protection from COVID-19 \u2014 as a tool to help travel and large events return safely.\n\nFour weeks after England took its first step out of lockdown by reopening schools, Mr. Johnson said Britain\u2019s vaccination program was proceeding well and infections were falling. He said the next step would come as planned on April 12, with the reopening of hairdressers, beauty salons, gyms, non-essential shops and bar and restaurant patios.\n\n\u201cWe set out our roadmap and we\u2019re sticking to it,\u201d Mr. Johnson said during a news conference.\n\nBut, he added, \u201cWe can\u2019t be complacent. We can see the waves of sickness afflicting other countries, and we\u2019ve seen how this story goes.\u201d\n\nA ban on overnight stays away from home in England will also be lifted April 12, and outdoor venues such as zoos and drive-in cinemas can operate again.\n\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are following similar but slightly different paths out of lockdown.\n\nBritain has recorded almost 1,27,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Europe. But infections and deaths both have fallen sharply during the current lockdown and since the start of a vaccination campaign that has given a first dose to more than 31 million people, or six in 10 adults.\n\nThe government aims to give all adults at least one shot of vaccine by July, and hopes that a combination of vaccination and mass testing will allow indoor socialising and large-scale events to return.\n\nLateral flow tests\n\nIt says all adults and children in England will be encouraged to have routine coronavirus tests twice a week as a way to stamp out new outbreaks. The government said free lateral flow tests will be available free starting on Friday by mail, from pharmacies and in workplaces.\n\nLateral flow tests give results in minutes but are less accurate than the PCR swab tests used to officially confirm cases of COVID-19. But the government insists they are reliable and will help find people who contract the virus but don't have symptoms.\n\nBritons are currently banned by law from going on holiday abroad under the extraordinary powers Parliament has given the government to fight the pandemic. The government said on Monday it won\u2019t lift the travel ban before May 17 -- and maybe later.\n\n\u201cThe government hopes people will be able to travel to and from the U.K. to take a summer holiday this year, but it is still too soon to know what is possible,\u201d it said in an official update.\n\nOnce travel resumes, Britain will rank countries on a traffic-light system as green, yellow or red based on their level of vaccinations, infections and worrying new virus variants. People arriving from \u201cgreen\u201d countries will have to be tested but won\u2019t face quarantine.\n\nThe government also is testing a system of \u201cCOVID-status certification\u201d \u2014 often dubbed \u201cvaccine passports\u201d \u2014 that would allow people seeking to travel or attend events to show they either have received a coronavirus vaccine, tested negative for the virus, or recently had COVID-19 and therefore have some immunity.\n\nA series of events will start this month, including soccer matches, comedy shows and marathon races. The government said the first events will rely only on testing, \u201cbut in later pilots vaccination and acquired immunity are expected to be alternative ways to demonstrate status.\u201d\n\nVaccine passports under fire\n\nThe issue of vaccine passports has been hotly debated around the world, raising questions about how much governments, employers and venues have a right to know about a person\u2019s virus status. The idea is opposed by a wide swath of British lawmakers, from left-of-center Opposition politicians to members of Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party, and the policy could face stiff opposition when it is put before Parliament later this month.\n\nConservative legislator Graham Brady said vaccine passports would be \u201cintrusive, costly and unnecessary.\u201d The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, called the idea \u201cun-British.\u201d\n\nThe government said vaccine passports were all but unavoidable, since many countries were certain to demand proof of COVID-19 status for entry. And it said barring British businesses from asking customers for similar proof would be \"an unjustified intrusion on how businesses choose to make their premises safe.\u201d\n\nThe government said, however, that vaccine passports would never be needed to access \u201cessential public services, public transport and essential shops.\u201d\n\nMr. Johnson acknowledged that vaccine passports raised \u201ccomplicated ethical and practical issues\" and stressed their introduction was not imminent.\n\n\"We're some way off finalising any plans for COVID-certification in the U.K.,\" he said."},

Discretion is advised.\n\nI sat in a psychiatrist\u2019s room at one of Delhi\u2019s best known mental health facilities. Surrounded with drawings by children, most happy-looking pictures, I told the doctor my \u2018case history\u2019. As a health journalist I had done enough stories over the years to understand the importance of including everything, to maximise my visit and my treatment. I was determined to stay in control.\n\n\u2018Anorexia\u2019 she jotted down, with a few more symptoms. Even as she wrote it down, I wondered if I should reiterate that I had it in school \u2014 at 17, when I believed I was fat. I wasn\u2019t. I want to tell her that while I had always had a bad relationship with food, the anorexia had never recurred. Like most people who don\u2019t speak up because they assume they\u2019ve got it wrong, I let it be.\n\nOn every occasion after, when she\u2019d spend about 10 minutes with me, she\u2019d ask how I was doing with my anorexia. Every time I would tell her it wasn\u2019t a concern at the moment. I wanted to say I still felt fat, binge ate, but from someone at their \u2018ideal weight\u2019 I felt I was wasting her time. There was always a crowd outside her door with people spilling in, and their concerns seemed more urgent, more serious than mine.\n\nShe prescribed me pills \u2014 SSRIs \u2014 meds that give depressed people a \u2018shot\u2019 of serotonin, one of the four happy hormones. I was diagnosed with dysthymia, a chronic, long-term, mild depression. Its equivalent to a physical health problem is this: imagine if you had low grade fever every day for over two years. You learn to live with it, telling yourself you have to dress up, work hard, pack lunch, socialise.\n\nI also had thoughts of suicide, and was told strictly to come in to the hospital if I felt the urge very strongly. I said I didn\u2019t feel the urge strongly. It was just a recurring thought. Nothing more. A sort of mental getaway when life felt overwhelming. It often did, three years ago. Sometimes, it still does.\n\nI was also \u2018handled\u2019 by a psychologist. She helped me some. So did the meds. With both, I was able to see in time that sunshine, healthy food, and exercise \u2014 and if I could combine them, exercise in the sun \u2014 helped me more than anyone talking to me about flawed thinking patterns (though an awareness of this helps).\n\nI now also understand that we all have choices \u2014 around the way we react, the memories we hold on to, the grudges we nurse, the friends we keep. The anxiety still rises to my throat \u2014 it\u2019s a feeling I realise I have lived with through life. Imagine being in a fight or flight stage for a lot of the day, across years. This pattern is going to take time to get out of; my wounds will take time to heal. But I know I must heal. Life is long, and it\u2019s best lived with a bit of fun.\n\nI do tell a few people that I have experienced dysthymia, but I am careful about who I tell, lest people judge me, as being an unworthy mother, an undependable colleague.\n\nFor those I can speak to, I say that there are some days I don\u2019t want to get out of bed, when I don\u2019t want to speak to anyone. On those days, I still put on a dress, some kajal, smile at myself in the mirror and step out. Because there\u2019s always the sun, and it invariably shines through the clouds.\n\nThe writer wishes to remain anonymous.\n\nIf these topics cause emotional, mental, or physical distress, please call 24-hour helplines Sneha at 044-24640059 or Aasra at 9820466726\n\nIn this column, we invite people to share their lived experiences of mental health"},

Earlier, two tenders for 50,000 tonnes each had to be scrapped mainly due to high quotes. Faced with production shortages, Pakistan is trying to import sugar in order to boost domestic availability and check retail prices which have shot up to PKR 100 per kg.\n\nLast week, there was a sudden hope of trade reopening between the two nations in sugar and cotton after Pakistan's Economic Coordination Committee allowed import of these two commodities from India. However, Pakistan's federal cabinet back-tracked on the decision.\n\nIssuing a fresh international tender for import of 50,000 tonnes of white sugar, TCP made it clear to global suppliers that \"the cargo (white sugar) should not be originated from Israel or any other banned country.\" Global suppliers should submit bids by April 14 and deliver the commodity at any port in Karachi, it said.\n\n\u2018Bad luck\u2019\n\nCommenting on the development, All India Sugar Trade Association (AISTA) Chairman Praful Vithalani said, \"Bad luck for Pakistan. Will you get sugar at prices, quality and speed with lowest freight parity of Indian sugar?\" For Pakistan, importing white sugar from India would have been much cheaper and faster via land route compared from other countries, he told PTI.\n\n\"Through land route via Punjab, white sugar would cost about $398 per tonne (which includes freight charges and delivery at godown),\" he added. According to AISTA, TCP had scrapped earlier two tenders for import of sugar because of high quotes. The lowest bid it received was around $540 per tonne by Al Khaleez, Dubai.\n\nPakistan, which is expecting sugar production of 5.6 million tonnes in the ongoing 2020-21 marketing year (October-September), is facing a shortage of 5,00,000 tonnes, according to Pakistani traders, whereas India, the world's second largest sugar producing nation after Brazil, is sitting on a surplus stock and targeting to export 6 million tonnes in the ongoing 2020-21 marketing year."},

It was at Ginza in Connaught Place. Your childhood food memories mould your tastes, no matter how many cuisines and flavours you try out as you grow older. That explains why Chinjabi \u2014 a mix of Chinese and Punjabi \u2014 continues to enthral me.\n\nI was in a nostalgic mood last week, as it was Holi and we were cooped up inside. I thought back to the old Chinese restaurants we used to frequent on festive occasions. The yearning for some old-fashioned Delhi-style Chinese food \u2014 doused with a generous dollop of soya sauce \u2014 grew. I went looking for a suitable Chinese eatery that I had not tried out before.\n\nThe result was a place called Noodle Bowl, a popular chain with branches everywhere. I looked up Swiggy, and found that the menu included pork, which many restaurants sadly do not serve any more.\n\nAfter a brief discussion at home, we decided on Chong do chicken (\u20b9359), five spice lamb (\u20b9479), crispy pork pepper salt (\u20b9379), vegetable spring roll (\u20b9109), chicken momos (\u20b9109 for four), vegetable fried rice (\u20b9189) and half a plate of vegetable noodles (\u20b9119).\n\nFirst the bad news: The dishes more or less looked the same. Now the good news: They, however, had their own characteristic flavours, and quite a nice taste. The pork was crunchy, had an aftertaste of pepper, and was a good appetiser. Both the lamb and the chicken dishes did come in a soya dressing, but I enjoyed them. The lamb was tender and the sauce, cooked with onion, ginger and capsicum, nicely tangy.\n\nWhat was really nice was the chicken: pieces of chicken breast with spring onions, red and yellow pepper, black mushroom, Chinese cabbage and lemon juice. The sauce was mildly sweet, possibly because of the peppers, and I really enjoyed that. The crunchy veggies added to the taste and texture. The chicken pieces were deliciously squashy and went well with the fried rice.\n\nThe rice was long-grained, and came with bits of veggies, and a nice aroma. The noodles, however, were nothing much to write home about, quite like the spring rolls, which were too hard. The dim sums got a B from us \u2014 neither very good, nor too bad.\n\nNoodle Bowl is value for money, and the portions are generous. Four of us had this meal, and there was enough left over for lunch and half a dinner the next day,\n\nI am not all that fond of Chinese dessert, so I ended with two kinds of gujiyas (it was around Holi, after all).

I will remain committed to the constitution of the dear Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,\" Prince Hamza said in the letter released by the palace.\n\nAn earlier royal palace tweet said the king had entrusted Prince Hassan, also a former crown prince, to take charge of the matter and that Prince Hamza had agreed to family mediation over the affair.\n\nOn Saturday, the military warned Prince Hamza over actions it said were undermining \"security and stability\" in Jordan, and he later said he was under house arrest. Several high-profile figures were also detained.\n\nPlot to destabilise country\n\nOfficials said on Sunday Prince Hamza had liaised with people who had contacts with foreign parties in a plot to destabilise Jordan, an important ally of the United States, and that he had been under investigation for some time.\n\nThe half-brother of King Abdullah and former heir to the throne said in a voice recording released by Jordan's opposition that he would not comply after being barred from any activity and told to keep quiet.\n\nWhile Prince Hamza is not seen as a direct threat to the king, his actions suggested he wanted to shore up his position with the Jordanian public after being removed from the royal succession.\n\n\"For sure I won't obey when they tell you that you cannot goo ut or tweet or reach out to people but are only allowed to see the family,\" he said in the recording circulated to friends and contacts.\n\nThe intrigue shook Jordan's image as a haven of stability in the unpredictable Middle East.\n\nMotives remain unclear\n\nIt is unclear why the kingdom decided to crack down on Prince Hamza now, but he put himself at growing risk by stepping up visits in recent weeks to tribal gatherings where the king and his government have been criticised more openly.\n\nPublic anger has also increased since nine COVID-19 patients died when oxygen ran out in a newly built state hospital,exposing negligence blamed on official mismanagement and corruption. Protests were broken up with tear gas.\n\nThe prince went to the homes of those who died to pay condolences, hoping to upstage the monarch who had earlier gone to the hospital to defuse anger, officials say. It was the first such open rift in the royal family in many years.\n\nKing Abdullah removed Prince Hamza from his position as heirto the throne in 2004.\n\nIn a video passed to the BBC by Prince Hamza's lawyer on Saturday, the prince accused Jordan's leaders of corruption, apparently hoping to tap into the public's frustrations.\n\nPublic sympathises\n\nPrince Hamza is not seen as a threat to the monarchy, which enjoys the support of the army and security services, but has gained sympathy among Jordanians sceptical of the government's accusations about his foreign links, saying it was a campaign to defame him.\n\n\"This is character assassination without evidence,\" said AliR. al Tarawneh in a tweet.\n\nA supporter identified only as Razan said on Twitter therewas \"no good in a country that imprisons its prince.\"\n\nOthers felt he was driven only by revenge at being sidelined and wanted to win popularity in tribal gatherings by emulating,in tone and language, his late father, who is revered by many Jordanians.\n\nPrince Hamza is the oldest son of the late King Hussein and his wife Noor, who had groomed him as a future monarch. He has served in the Jordanian armed forces.\n\nHe angered the royal palace by trying to endear himself to a poor tribal constituency that has felt the impact of a shrinking economy and the state's inability to keep creating jobs that have long absorbed tribesmen in rural and Bedouin areas.\n\nArrests made\n\nOfficials said between 14 and 16 people had been arrested in connection with the alleged plot.\n\nThe state news agency said those arrested included Bassem Awadallah, a U.S.-educated confidant of the king who became minister of finance and adviser to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed-bin Salman, and royal family member Sharif Hassan Ben Zaid\n\nJordan's neighbours and allies have expressed solidarity with King Abdullah over the security measures in the kingdom."},

Radhakrishnan on Monday said restrictions will be tightened in COVID-19 containment areas.\n\nRestrictions will gradually be enforced for non-essential activities based on government\u2019s policy decisions and views of public health experts. \u201cSome steps should be taken without affecting the public and with public cooperation we can avoid an out-of-control situation like Maharashtra. Of the 4.5 lakh areas, there are 925 containment areas that had more than three COVID-19 cases. Restrictions will be tightened in these areas. We will have focus volunteers and take up testing,\u201d he told reporters shortly after an inspection at the State Vaccine Store.\n\nHe said people should learn to avoid crowding at funerals, marriages and cultural events, and avoid unnecessary travel. Starting April 7, the day after polling, he said door-to-door fever surveillance in containment areas and screening centres for triaging of COVID-19 patients would be taken up in full swing.\n\nNoting that there were over one lakh COVID-19 cases in India on Sunday, he said that in Tamil Nadu, the cases were rising gradually but the positivity rate was not as high as it was in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab, he said. \u201cNevertheless, the numbers are slightly alarming and we have crossed 3,500 cases a day. There is continuous monitoring, and we are ensuring that there is no lacunae in testing, tracking and isolation. A minimum of 20 to 30 contacts of a patient are being traced, tested and isolated,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the main challenges was house to house fever surveillance in containment areas, he said and added: \u201cStarting April 7, we will take up house-to-house fever surveillance in containment areas in full swing. We did not carry out the same to avoid creating confusion during election time. The field-level teams in each of the 15 zones of Greater Chennai Corporation and monitoring teams at the district-level are in place,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Radhakrishnan said that COVID-19 Care Centres had been started in all districts. Taking into account the five hospitals in Chennai \u2014 Government Corona Hospital, Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, Government Stanley Medical College Hospital and Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital \u2014 1,869 persons were admitted, while the total bed capacity was 4,368. \u201cPersons are directly going to the Government Corona Hospital. Those with mild symptoms can go to CCCs. After April 7, we will have 10 screening centres from the present three for triaging patients. Not all patients need to be treated in hospitals and doctors will decide on that,\u201d he said.\n\nSlow pace of vaccination\n\nAnother area of concern was vaccination. The State has so far received nearly 54 lakh doses of the vaccines but the off-take had been low, he said. Only around 15,000 people were vaccinated on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe disease is on the rise. All those aged above 45 should take the vaccine. We could not promote vaccination on campaign mode due to the model code of conduct. However, after April 7, we will take up this on a campaign mode to motivate people who are eligible to get vaccinated... Some might get infected after vaccination. It is said to have 70 to 85% efficacy 14 days after the second dose. In such cases, it will not be a severe case of COVID-19,\u201d he said.\n\nNoting that vaccine hesitancy continued in the State, he said that neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka had more takers than T.N. The average capacity of a vaccination centre was 100 persons a day.\n\nOn an average, RGGGH and Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate, vaccinate up to 500 persons a day but in many cities, districts and rural parts, only 25 to 40 persons are vaccinated, he said.\n\n\u201cThe Centre\u2019s supply of additional doses depended on the three-day average utilisation. States that have higher utilisation such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are getting more vaccines supplied. There is a view that we are not utilising the already supplied vaccines,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, 4.25 lakh doses of Covaxin and 28.30 lakh doses of Covishield were utilised, he said. The State has till now received 7.8 lakh doses of Covaxin and 47.43 lakh doses of Covishield.\n\nDaily analysis till April 4 showed that Chennai\u2019s test positivity rate was 8.01%, Ranipet 7.39%, Theni 6.85%, Coimbatore 6.17%, Chengalpattu 5.53%, Tiruvannamalai 5.38% and Salem 5.07%.\n\nPositivity rate\n\n\u201cExcept for these seven districts, the remaining have a lesser positivity rate. As per the Centre\u2019s direction, we should bring down the positivity rate to below 5%. We should do additional tests for which fever camps will come in handy. The Corporation on an average conducts 500 camps a day, while in districts, 100 camps will be held where additional tests will be carried out. Attention will be given to all other districts with above 2% positivity rate. Only Tirupattur has below 2% positivity rate,\u201d he said.\n\nDue to lack of adherence of SOPs such as checking for temperature and hand hygiene in places such as the service sector, the disease was spreading from one person to many. \u201cElections were a challenge, but do not assume that cases would drop after April 6. We have had cases through banks, service sectors and training centres,\u201d he said. He said although schools were closed, training centres were being run illegally.\n\nDirector of Public Health and Preventive Medicine T. S. Selvavinayagam was present."},

It was included under a Cochin Smart Mission Limited project, but was later removed from it. The Corporation was attempting to get it included under a canal rejuvenation project that Kochi Metro Rail Limited was proposing, he added, but before a decision was made on that, cleaning of the canal would have to be initiated.\n\nThe Corporation Council had decided in February that a master plan of the drainage network would be prepared to deal with waterlogging. \u201cThis will require time and government help, and has been put on hold till after the polls,\u201d said the Mayor."},

In the aviary section that houses many exotic birds like varieties of macaw and other small birds, the cages are kept cool with khus khus mats and periodical spraying of water.\n\nThe animals are at present housed in 77 enclosures spread across the 625 acres of the zoo park.\n\n\u201cWe are setting up fans in enclosures for animals like wild dog, panther, chimpanzee, white tiger and hyena.

According to the zoo veterinarians, when the atmospheric temperature rises, the metabolic rate of animals goes down. A reduced appetite is the first sign of an animal being gripped by the summer heat. In addition to the usual food, summer specials like watermelon and cucumber which have a rich water content are fed to the animals. \u201cIn addition to these, we also provide glucose and B complex in the diet,\u201d Ms. Salaria said.\n\nThe summer can be particularly challenging for the oldest animals of IGZP \u2014 white tiger Sirish and Indian Gaur Raja.\n\n\u201cA set of routine has been put in place for the oldest animals such as administering supplements like Vitamin B Complex.

Vivekananda Reddy brought to justice.\n\nIn an open letter released on Monday, Ms. Vijayamma said that her son Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and daughter Y.S. Sharmila also wished to see justice done in the case. She further alleged that a section of the media was resorting to yellow journalism in the case in an attempt to drive a wedge between Vivekananda Reddy\u2019s daughter Sunitha and the Y.S. family.\n\n\u201cA section of the media, unable to support the TDP which is fast losing its political relevance, has been spreading a malicious campaign against the Y.S. family. At a time when the TDP has given up and has withdrawn from contesting in ZPTC and MPTC elections, a section of the media is blowing up the remarks made by Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy\u2019s daughter out of proportion,\u201d Ms. Vijayamma said in the letter.\n\n\u201cApprehensions made by Vivekananda Reddy\u2019s daughter over the delay in the case are being distorted by the media, but we are equally keen on seeing that the culprits are brought to book,\u201d she said, adding that a prominent journalist of a vernacular newspaper was repeating lies over and over again in the hope that people will come to believe them.\n\n\u201cVivekananda\u2019s murder took place in March 2019.

For years, these villages have remained inaccessible to vehicles, and can be reached only on foot. As in the past, donkeys on Monday began to trek up to help in the election process.\n\nIn the Anthiyur Assembly constituency, election officials, two donkeys and a few local people trekked a nine-km jungle terrain to ferry electronic voting machines (EVMs), Voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) units and other materials to Kathirimalai village that has 134 votes.\n\nComing under the Bargur panchayat, the village is located 1,200 metres above sea level inside the reserve forest area of the Chennampatti Forest Range in the Erode Forest Division. With no power supply, only solar lamps light up the village, which does not have mobile phone connectivity either.\n\nThe Government Tribal Residential Middle School serves as the polling booth at Kathirimalai.

Palanivel and comprising polling and police personnel and forest guard, travelled 58 km from Anthiyur and reached Kathiripatti. While EVMs and VVPAT units were loaded on the two donkeys, other polling materials were carried as head-load by 10 local people. The team started at 3.30 p.m. from the foothills and was expected to reach the hilltop by 7.30 p.m.\n\nAfter polling ends at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, officials have to climb down at night to reach the foothills, from where they can drive to the counting centre at the Institute of Road and Transport Technology at Chithode. The total distance they have to cover is 78 km.\n\nAt Pennagaram in Dharmapuri district, EVMs were fastened to donkeys to reach Kottur, Kottu Alakettu and Erimalai. The run-up to the election was marked by a poll boycott threat by the villages over the lack of roads to reach the hill hamlets. Chinnaraj, 61, has been at it for 43 years, making his donkeys carry ballot boxes to the villages uphill.\n\nHowever, this time, a section of the Kottur residents declared a poll boycott for want of better roads. Officials visited the village that has 730 voters to promise them roads and persuade them to vote. Though a tar-top road had been promised at every election, the villagers had to contend with only a \u2018kuccha\u2019 road. And, every election, it has become a routine for Chinnaraj and his donkeys to lug ballot boxes to the village."},

While the lockdown limited people\u2019s movements, it opened new vistas for litigants and lawyers across India to approach, through technology, the country\u2019s highest court with relative ease. It is no wonder then that despite demands for a return to physical hearings by the Bar in Delhi, there are calls for virtual access to the Supreme Court to continue.\n\nIncreasing reach\n\nEven at the time the Constitution was being debated by the Constituent Assembly, geographical access to the Supreme Court was flagged as a concern. The B.R. Ambedkar-led Drafting Committee was nevertheless of the view that the Court must have a specified place of sitting and that litigants should \u201cknow where to go and whom to approach\u201d. However, the framers of the Constitution agreed that the volume of litigation from different parts of the country may require the Supreme Court to increase its reach and hold court elsewhere. Accordingly, in recognition of the same, the Constitution empowered the Chief Justice to hold sittings of the Supreme Court through Circuit Benches in places other than Delhi as well. However, despite an increasing caseload and repeated pleas by litigants and governments, successive Chief Justices have refused to invoke this constitutional power for reasons best known to them.\n\nIn India, given the unified, single-pyramidal structure of the judicial system, all types of cases can potentially make their way to the Supreme Court, irrespective of the place or forum of the original institution. It is the effective exercise of that right, however, that is curtailed by the court assembling exclusively in Delhi. According to a report by the Centre for Policy Research, a disproportionately high number of cases filed in the Supreme Court originated in High Courts closer to Delhi. For instance, cases from States like West Bengal, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, which collectively account for around a fifth of India\u2019s total population, contribute to less than 10% of the court\u2019s docket. On the other hand, almost 18% of all cases in the Supreme Court originate from Punjab and Haryana, with less than 5% of the total population share.\n\nGeographical constraints have also meant that appearing before the Supreme Court has inescapably become the domain of a select few lawyers in and around Delhi. Such implied exclusivity consequently translates into steep and often prohibitive monetary costs for litigants. Without the option of a local advocate of their choice, litigants are forced to choose from what the Bar in Delhi offers, both in terms of quality and costs.\n\nA Court for everyone\n\nThus, the pandemic, although for different reasons, has compelled the Supreme Court to attempt to overcome physical constraints in an effort to increase access, albeit virtually. Over the past year, with virtual hearings, what was seen as the exclusive domain of a limited number of lawyers in Delhi has opened up to advocates from all over India, most of whom could only ever have dreamt of addressing the Supreme Court in their lifetimes. Litigants now have the option to engage a local lawyer of their own choice and convenience, including the same lawyer who argued their case before the lower court.\n\nIndeed, virtual hearings may not be the perfect alternative, but such imperfections must be preferred over a denial of the right to access justice itself. It is only when each person in India is provided unhindered access to its corridors can the Supreme Court be said to have fulfilled its constitutional promise. More than one Law Commission and Parliamentary Committee have recommended Circuit Benches of the Supreme Court to be set up around the country. Nonetheless, till the judiciary acts on such proposals, virtual hearings should be allowed to continue, if not as a matter of right, then at least as a matter of just and equitable policy.\n\nAnhad S.

Even as pre-election surveys and opinion polls predict a second term for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the outcome would still depend on many factors, including the polarisation of Christian votes in central Kerala. While pollsters generally tend to take the Christian community as a monolith, or distinguish only between Syrian Christians and Latins, it is important to analyse the historic role played by the Syro-Malabar Church in Kerala politics to establish the root cause of this vote shift.\n\nSwitching of loyalties\n\nSyrian Christians, or Saint Thomas Christians, are further divided into the Syro-Malabar Church (Catholics), the Jacobite, Orthodox and Mar Thoma factions of the Malankara Rite, apart from the Protestants. The long-standing dispute between the Jacobite and Orthodox factions had been sought to be capitalised on by both the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kerala for a while, but it is the tectonic shift in the political stance of the numerically strong Syro-Malabar Church which jolted the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) in the preceding local body polls.\n\nThe significance of the switching of loyalties of the Syro-Malabar Church needs to be underscored by the fact that it has been a crucial political player in the State right from the 1950s. In fact, the Catholic Church was at the vanguard of the Vimochana Samaram (Liberation Struggle) which felled the first E.M.S. Namboodiripad-led Communist Party of India (CPI) government.\n\nThe formation of the Kerala Congress, the Congress breakaway party, in 1964, was the first instance of the Church ditching the Congress in Kerala. But when the Congress split at the national level in 1969 and Youth Congress leaders such as A.K. Antony and Vayalar Ravi assumed leadership of the party with their progressive policies in Kerala, the Church went back to supporting the Kerala Congress. When the Kerala Congress joined the Congress-CPI alliance government led by C. Achutha Menon in 1975 during the Emergency, it backed that government, and its support for Congress has continued since. Even as recently as the tenure of the previous LDF government led by V.S. Achuthanandan, the Church and the CPI(M) were at each other\u2019s throats, with then Education Minister M.A. Baby regularly baiting the Church.\n\nHowever, some developments during the latter half of the tenure of the Achuthanandan government led to a gradual change in this equation. The Kerala Congress faction led by P.J. Joseph was increasingly getting marginalised in the LDF and the 2008 delimitation exercise saw Malappuram district, the stronghold of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), getting additional seats. The IUML had been politically isolated in Kerala politics until 1967 when the Left gave it political representation. The party made steady progress in extending its clout.\n\nPost the 2008 delimitation exercise, the Syro-Malabar Church took the initiative to broker a truce between the Kerala Congress factions of K.M. Mani and P.J. Joseph leading to their merger in 2010 to try and ensure parity with the IUML in their political representation in the UDF. However, the Congress refused to concede extra seats to the unified Kerala Congress and the merged party ended up contesting much fewer seats than the IUML in the 2011 Assembly polls. In that close election, the UDF prevailed over the LDF. The IUML, which had a good strike rate compared to other parties, demanded a fifth ministerial position, thereby breaking the power equations prevailing in the UDF. Not only did IUML\u2019s flexing of muscles have an impact on the majority community, it also riled the Church which saw the once dominant Kerala Congress, a party it identified with, being reduced to a small player in the UDF. Nevertheless, as the Congress had the advantage of being in power in New Delhi, it managed to keep things in check for the time being.\n\nFollowing the Congress\u2019s ouster at the Centre and the UDF\u2019s loss in Kerala in 2016, stray cases of Christian girls running away with their partners to join the Islamic State began to occupy the minds of the clergy and the BJP\u2019s high-pitched \u2018love jihad\u2019 campaign began to resonate with the Church during this period. This phase also coincided with a steep fall in prices for rubber, a crop synonymous with the Syrian Christian community in central Kerala, and an increase in Gulf remittances and growing affluence among the Muslim community.\n\nFear of IUML domination\n\nMeanwhile, the Kerala Congress also came out of the UDF and the ball was set rolling for the party\u2019s LDF entry before the next election. With K.M. Mani\u2019s demise, the official faction was led by Jose K. Mani, his son, and joined forces with the LDF. This brought the Church closer to the Communists. For a long time, K.M. Mani was the Church\u2019s pointsman in the UDF. His demise meant that the UDF no longer had a line of communication open with the Church. The Congress\u2019s tactic to bring Oommen Chandy, hailing from the Orthodox faction, to the forefront in the run-up to the Assembly election had absolutely no impact on the Church whatsoever as Mr. Chandy no longer enjoyed the Church\u2019s trust.\n\nThe wresting of three extra seats by the IUML in the UDF, up from 24 in 2016 to 27 in 2021, further raised the hackles of the Church even as the P.J Joseph-led Kerala Congress faction had to settle for just 10 seats. Meanwhile, the LDF was magnanimous in allotting more seats to the Jose K. Mani-led Kerala Congress faction, sending a clear signal to the Church that its representative in the LDF would get decent accommodation.\n\nAn article by a key IUML leader in the party organ on Hagia Sophia\u2019s re-opening as a mosque in Turkey and the Congress\u2019s confused response on the issue of reservations for economically weaker sections following IUML\u2019s posturing had exacerbated the Church\u2019s schism with the UDF even before the local body polls. The LDF\u2019s win defying all predictions in those polls was clearly aided by the Christian vote shift away from the UDF in Central Travancore, among other factors.\n\nThe Church reckons that it is in its interest to back the LDF this time around. Its fear of IUML dominating the UDF is also parroted by the LDF propagating this theory with abandon. The UDF is the ultimate loser here as any polarisation in its Christian vote will upset its plans of coming back to power. The Congress hasn\u2019t also helped its cause by failing to open a channel of communication with the Church following K.M. Mani\u2019s demise. Unless the laity chooses to defy the Church in large numbers, the UDF will end up paying a heavy price for failing to arrest matters following the setback in the local body polls.\n\nAnand Kochukudy is a Kerala-based journalist and former editor of The Kochi Post"},

The petitioner has sought a direction for quashing his daughter\u2019s statement before the magistrate, contending that it was recorded \u201cillegally\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is a well-known fact that my daughter was under extraneous influence for the last 15 days or more, and though a complaint is said to have been lodged by her, she was not allowed to appear before the investigation officer or before the court, and it was all through an advocate as her mouthpiece,\u201d the petitioner stated.\n\nAccording to the petitioner, his daughter had earlier told him that she was not the one who was found in the CD and that she was under tremendous pressure and \u201cnot in a position to say anything\u201d.\n\n\u2018Statement vitiated\u2019\n\nThe petitioner claimed that he had learnt that an advocate, Surya Mukundraj, who is also general secretary of the legal cell of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, was present at the time of the recording of statement. \u201cThe statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC is vitiated for the sole reason of the presence of Mr. Mukundraj as reported in the media,\u201d the petitioner contended.\n\nThe petitioner also stated that he had \u201csensed pressure\u201d on his daughter after he came to know through the media that her statement would be recorded by a magistrate even before she appeared before the investigating agency. He appealed through the media to keep his daughter \u201cin isolation or in my custody or in the custody of the judiciary or some independent authority\u201d to ensure that her statement is free of any pressure.\n\n\u201cThe facts and circumstances under which she was produced before the magistrate show that no effort was made to ensure that she made her statement voluntarily,\u201d the petitioner claimed."},

Like individuals, nations too are prone to using epithets, but are vexed when paid back in similar coinage. Therefore, the U.S.-China Foreign Ministers\u2019 meeting in March at Alaska was instructive in many respects.\n\nThe public is accustomed to read-outs about conversations between international leaders. These often portray a righteous West instructing the world on how to behave by constructing a media narrative for the domestic audience. It cannot be assumed that foreign leaders who receive diatribes from western counterparts listen penitently without response. It is noteworthy that there are few read-outs of conversations between non-western leaders, who do not pontificate and have no global media at their disposal.\n\nConfrontation and competition\n\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump accused China of unfair trade practices and pursued a dual policy of offering deals and threatening sanctions, but China continued to extend its influence and counter American increases in military funding by expanding its own military power. The U.S. and Europe have imposed sanctions against China, Russia and others. The U.S.-sponsored Quad with Japan, India and Australia will prove an uphill effort because even some of the U.S.\u2019s formal allies have re-shaped their foreign and economic relations with China.\n\nConfrontation and competition between the U.S. and China will dominate this century. Mr. Biden has censured China for human rights abuses in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, aggression in the South and East China Seas, intimidation of Taiwan, intellectual property theft, currency manipulation, and cyberattacks, but these homilies are incidental to U.S.-China tension, which is due to China\u2019s rise that is transforming power settings and the U.S.\u2019s attempts to constrict China before it becomes a peer competitor. China will surpass the U.S. as the world\u2019s largest economy, has established a worldwide network of economic ties and set up multilateral and financial institutions like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, New Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank to compete with the West-dominated International Monetary Fund and World Bank.\n\nSharp exchanges\n\nPreliminaries for the Alaska meeting were not promising: Beijing saw it as the start of a strategic dialogue, while Washington diminished it as a one-off event. The U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, hoping to seize the initiative, opened the meeting with a charge sheet against China, comprising attacks on values; threats to a rules-based order that maintains global stability; China\u2019s actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan; cyberattacks on the U.S.; and economic coercion against U.S. allies. To this, Chinese Communist Party leader Yang Jiechi countered that China would strongly oppose interference in China\u2019s internal affairs, referred to the U.S.\u2019s struggling democracy and poor treatment of minorities, and criticised U.S. policies as seeking military and financial hegemony to impose extra-territorial jurisdiction and suppress other countries. He concluded that the U.S. abuses definitions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges.\n\nThese sharp exchanges were intended for respective domestic audiences. The American media were bewildered about how to portray this accusation of their country\u2019s policies and resorted to calling the Chinese position intemperate. Despite the bombast, the Americans require the Chinese to deal with certain issues, and the meeting ended with anodyne agreement to work together on issues like climate change, COVID-19, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and G-20, health, cyber-security, the Iran nuclear issue, Afghanistan, Korea and Myanmar.\n\nThe U.S.-China rhetoric masks the reality that both countries need each other not only for world stability but growth, supply chains, jobs, services, investments and market access. China\u2019s rise generated booms for numerous Asian and Western economies and accelerated the transition of the U.S. towards the lower end of manufacturing. Sanctions used indiscriminately against China are unlikely to engender any change of behaviour, and it is clear that hectoring will not be left unanswered. The U.S. deals for the first time with an economic and military rival it cannot browbeat, and economic interdependence today makes the war of words confined to words. Mr. Putin correctly summed up this situation: \u201cThey (the Americans) think that we are like them, but we are different. We have a different genetic, cultural and moral code.\u201d With the prevailing mistrust across regions, every possible solution becomes an insuperable problem.\n\nKrishnan Srinivasan is a former Foreign Secretary"},

It is evident that ethics is a non-existent word as far as parties are concerned (Tamil Nadu, \u201cSeizures stand at \u20b9428.46 crore\u201d, April 5). God alone knows the value of the cash and valuables and items which have not been seized. The public will never know the truth or even who was behind all this. It is strange that no political candidate has been suspended for any of the seizures or action taken against any political party.\n\nS. Parthasarathy,\n\nChennai\n\nThe chief matters\n\nIn India, with perennial elections of every description, the quality of governance and its politics is disproportionately placed in the hands of its Election Commission. By its very construct, the Election Commission of India has been left to the ability, wisdom and innovation of the main person at its helm. Only some leave impressions, positive or negative, deeper than others and an attrition of public faith which reflects more on the individual than on the organisation. The CEC, in 1992, had disqualified 14,000 potential candidates for public office and on mass protests by the political groups, cancelled elections in Bihar and Punjab, to then elevate public faith. Its deferring the Gujarat elections in 2017 vis-\u00e0-vis the election dates of Himachal Pradesh, the disqualification of 20 MLAs of Delhi or issuing show cause notice only to Opposition leaders for campaign code violations, significantly dimmed its halo. The pattern seems to continue in circa 2021, much to our dismay. In the absence of collective political will or till we get no-nonsense, tough-as-nails ECI chief, prayer is a lone recourse.\n\nR.

Welfare schemes that usually make incumbents popular have added to the anti-incumbency woes of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, as the workers of her party made those the easy and only option for rent-seeking. \u2018Cut money\u2019, or the cut for TMC local leaders on welfare disbursement, is the most important reason for anti-incumbency in the State. The unaccountable nature of power at the panchayat level after the 2018 elections were rigged by the ruling party, made it into an apparatus of extraction rather than a dispenser of patronage. The balance between patronage and extraction, which sustains political parties, was lost. Second, Ms. Banerjee, sought to compensate for her past alliances with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), by an overuse of Muslim symbolism, which has caused a backlash among Hindus and Muslims.\n\nUsually, smart politicians use a crisis to neutralise accumulated resentments and reinforce their popularity. In Kerala, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan could turn two floods (2018 and 2019), a cyclone and the COVID-19 pandemic as opportunities to demonstrate his governance; in Assam, pandemic relief helped the BJP government quieten any public dissatisfaction and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma became the face of a caring government. In contrast, Ms. Banerjee\u2019s wayward workers made the Amphan cyclone (2020) in the midst of the pandemic a spectacle of corruption and inefficiency. The weakness of the state in West Bengal that the CPI(M)\u2019s organisational capacity could camouflage earlier became more pronounced under the TMC. The key strategist of the party has acknowledged that anti-incumbency is a major factor. In fact, it is the overarching theme.\n\nMs. Banerjee is trying to control the damage. Welfarism is an important tool in her kit \u2014 the TMC is offering a universal basic income for all families, if elected to power for a third term in West Bengal. She also realises that economic promises without emotional appeals are just not good enough. She is appealing to Bengali exceptionalism, and questioning Delhi imperialism, invoking the fear of the outsider, accompanied by a show of her Hindu anchorage.\n\nPolitical impact\n\nThe existence of strong anti-incumbency is not a question of debate, but its impact is. Who are the new claimants to power? Which one among them has the capacity to harness anti-incumbency in its favour? The Left-Congress-Indian Secular Front (ISF) alliance and the BJP are relentless in attacking Ms. Banerjee. There are two mobilising issues at play \u2014 one is the TMC\u2019s governance and the other is the Hindu-Muslim religious divide.\n\nThe Left-Congress campaign focuses on the TMC\u2019s track record; while the BJP is going on a no-holds-barred, double-barrel mobilisation on anti-incumbency and along the religious divide. In fact, the Left-Congress-ISF alliance can be of help to the BJP in two ways \u2014 it provides an alternative to those who are tired of the TMC, but would not vote for the BJP; and the emergence of cleric Abbas Siddiqui as a prominent face of the alliance fulfils the fear of the Muslim theme that headlines the BJP campaign.\n\nIn certain circumstances, a new claimant can spook voters to an extent that they would rather stay with the detested incumbent.\n\nCases of Gujarat, Bihar\n\nTwo recent examples, of the Congress in Gujarat in 2017, and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in Bihar in 2020, are instructive. The BJP government in Gujarat after being in power for 20 years; and the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar after 15 years in power faced massive anti-incumbency among their respective core voters. The capacity of the challengers, the Congress in Gujarat and the RJD in Bihar, was limited, significantly due to the strong-arm measures of central agencies.\n\nBut the defining turning point in both elections was a reframing of the campaign by the incumbent, from anti-incumbency to the basest instincts and fear of a threshold population. In Bihar, the non-Yadav Other Backward Classes groups would rather stay with the National Democratic Alliance than risk the possibility of Yadav domination under a new RJD government. In Gujarat, where the basest appeal is religion and not caste \u2014the spectre of a Muslim Chief Minister, the BJP\u2019s rhetoric in the last days of the campaign, held back enough flock in the incumbent\u2019s tent.\n\nMs. Banerjee\u2019s strategy is premised on a belief that Bengalis think as Bengalis first; and they cannot be communally polarised to the extent of Gujarat or Uttar Pradesh. The TMC strategy relies on demography \u2014 a fourth of West Bengal\u2019s voters are Muslims \u2014 and the assumption of a Bengali exceptionalism that is less permeable to intellectual ingress from the east. While demography is a strong barrier, Bengali exceptionalism could be an exaggeration. Bengal has been a recipient and originator of ideas in its interconnections with territories to the east. Some formative ideas of Hindu nationalism originated in Bengal in the works of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and U.N. Mukherji. In today\u2019s West Bengal, roughly 10% of the population is non-Bengali. The presumption that a latent, universal resentment against the \u2018national\u2019 is the leitmotif of Bengal politics is overwrought. In fact, Ms. Banerjee\u2019s emphasis on Bengali identity could backfire on her.\n\nThe cross-border factor\n\nMs. Banerjee\u2019s calculation is that Bengali nationalism could blunt the communal appeal of the BJP\u2019s politics, but the way the debate is playing out could further religious polarisation. There is a cross-border Bengali identity that connects the populations of West Bengal and Bangladesh. The BJP too has a cross-border politics that connects Bangladesh and West Bengal as one theatre, but its basic premise is Hindu cultural nationalism. This idea was reinforced in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s visit to Bangladesh recently. In the Hindutva imagination, West Bengal \u2014 and India \u2014 is a location of the Hindu refuge, while Bangladesh is a place of their persecution. The BJP has promised in West Bengal the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh. The BJP campaign in West Bengal has portrayed Ms. Banerjee\u2019s Bengali nationalism as illegitimate affinity towards Bangladesh. The BJP said West Bengal would become the next Kashmir under the TMC \u2014 suggesting that Bangladesh was also Pakistan until 1971. At this juncture, Bengali identity gets divided, not along the international border between India and Bangladesh and India, but as Hindus and Muslims who live on both sides. In other words, far from catalysing any Bengali renaissance against Hindutva, the invocation of Bengali nationalism may have invoked traumatic memories of communalism, separatism and violence that pulverised the region for decades, thanks to the BJP\u2019s retelling.\n\nGround realities\n\nWhile the incumbent\u2019s strategy has evident weaknesses, the challenger\u2019s capacity is not beyond doubt, despite help from central agencies. It has been pointed out that the BJP performs weaker in Assembly elections compared to Lok Sabha elections. The argument goes that if it goes lower than its 2019 performance, the BJP cannot win in West Bengal. But each election has unique factors at play, and history also tells us there is always a first time. The BJP has no baggage of history in West Bengal. However, the party\u2019s organisational capacity is limited in West Bengal, and it has no ground game \u2014 so much so that several of its high-profile rallies came a cropper. Comparing one election to another is always fraught with problems, but the situation in West Bengal is broadly comparable to Assam in 2016 \u2014 a besieged incumbent, a triangular fight in some regions, and the BJP led by defectors from other parties.\n\nvarghese.g@thehindu.co.in"},

A recent Pew Research Report shows that India\u2019s middle class may have shrunk by a third due to the novel coronavirus pandemic while the number of poor people earning less than \u20b9150 per day more than doubled. The Pew report also warned that the situation may actually be worse than estimated because of worsening inequalities. International organisations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the International Labour Organization have also warned about rising inequalities in several countries including India due to the pandemic.\n\nMade worse now\n\nInequalities in India have been high even in the pre-COVID-19 period. The economic shock due to the pandemic has been much more severe for the country for two reasons. First, pre-COVID-19, the economy was already slowing down, compounding existing problems of unemployment, low incomes, rural distress, malnutrition, and widespread inequality. Second, India\u2019s large informal sector is particularly vulnerable. Inequalities were increasing earlier also but the pandemic has widened them further. For example, the share of wages declined as compared to that of profits. The big companies and a large part of the corporate sector could manage the pandemic. The quarterly net profit of the BSE200 companies reached a record high of \u20b91.67 trillion in the third quarter of FY21 and was up by 57% year-on-year. But the informal sector and workers have suffered a lot with loss of incomes and employment in the last one year. In other words, the recovery is more k-shaped with rising inequalities.\n\nThe economy recovered in the third quarter of FY21 with a positive GDP growth of 0.4% as compared to minus 24.4% in the first quarter and minus 7.3% in the second quarter. For the year FY21, the economy would contract by 8%. GDP growth is likely to increase by 10%-11% in FY22. But the levels of GDP show that it will grow only around 1.1% in FY22 as compared to FY20 levels. According to the Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy, the employment rate is still 2.5 percentage points lower now as compared to the level before the lockdown last year. Women lost more jobs and many are out of the workforce. Inequalities have increased in health care and education.\n\nA three-step plan\n\nAs the British economist Anthony Atkinson says, \u201cmuch is written about the 1 per cent and the 99 per cent. But, if we are serious about reducing income inequality, what can be done?\u201d Reduction in inequalities is important for its own sake and for improving demand which can raise private investment, consumption and exports for higher and sustainable economic growth.\n\nWe concentrate here on a three-pronged approach for reducing inequalities. These are: focus on employment and wages; raising human development, and quasi universal basic income and other social safety nets.\n\nFirst, creation of quality or productive employment is central to the inclusive growth approach. At the macro level, the investment rate which declined from 39% in 2011-12 to 31.7% in 2018-19 has to be improved. Investment in infrastructure including construction can create employment. In the recent Budget, the central government has rightly focused on capital expenditure for infrastructure.\n\nThere are seven challenges in employment: creating productive jobs for seven to eight million per year; correcting the mismatch between demand and supply of labour (only 2.3% of India\u2019s workforce has formal skill training as compared to 96% in South Korea, 80% in Japan, and 52% in the United States; Structural change challenge (manufacturing should be the engine of growth. Here, labour-intensive exports are important and manufacturing and services are complementary); focusing on micro, small & medium enterprises and informal sectors including rights of migrants; Getting ready for automation and technology revolution; Social security and decent working conditions for all; raising real wages of rural and urban workers and guaranteeing minimum wages.\n\nFixing dichotomies\n\nThe second approach is in creating equality of opportunity by improving human development. Increasing public expenditure on health and education is another form of redistributive measure. COVID-19 has supplied us several lessons on the health sector. Public expenditure on health is only 1.5% of GDP. Apart from spending on vaccines and other related measures, we need to move towards universal health care and spend 2%-3% of GDP on health. Education and health achievements are essential for reducing inequality of opportunities. Much dichotomy exists in both these sectors. In education, there are islands of excellence that can compete internationally even as a vast majority of masses of children are churned out with poor learning achievement. We also have the experience of a digital gap in education during the pandemic. One has to fix this dichotomy in health and education.\n\nThe third approach is in providing a quasi-universal basic income and other safety nets. For example, C. Rangarajan and I had suggested three proposals on minimum income for the poor and the vulnerable in the post-pandemic period. These are: cash transfers to all women above the age of 20 years; expanding the number of days provided under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and a national employment guarantee scheme for urban areas. In all these proposals, there is no problem of identification. A combination of cash transfers and an expanded guarantee scheme would provide income support to the needy.\n\nApart from the ideas above, increasing farmers\u2019 income especially for small and marginal farmers is needed to reduce inequalities and create demand. Farmer producer organisations should be strengthened. States have to be given a bigger role in agri-marketing reforms. The terms of trade for agriculture have to be improved.\n\nTax base, budgets\n\nEnhancing tax and non-tax revenues of the government is needed to spend on the above priorities. The tax/GDP ratio has to be raised, with a wider tax base. Richer sections have to pay more taxes. Similarly, the inequalities between the Centre and States in finances should be reduced. State budgets must be strengthened to improve capital expenditures on physical infrastructure and spending on health, education and social safety nets.\n\nApart from economic factors, non-economic factors such as deepening democracy and decentralisation can help in reducing inequalities. Unequal distribution of development is rooted in the inequalities of political, social and economic power. We have to find opportunities and spaces where the power can be challenged and redistributed. In the post-COVID-19 world, addressing inequality is important for higher and sustainable economic growth and the well-being of the population.\n\nS.
