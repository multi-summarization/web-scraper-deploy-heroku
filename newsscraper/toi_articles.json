This happened on December 20, 2020 and January 10, 2021 when the US added 4,02,270 and 3,13,516 new cases on a single day.If cases continue to grow at this rate then India will add about a million cases in three days \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a feat that is unparalleled so far.No other country has seen such a level of new cases and evidently, the healthcare system of no other country has ever been so overwhelmed by Covid The impact of this level of cases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than a lakh new cases for the 17th consecutive day is evident on the healthcare system and there is a steady increase in daily fatality.For the 10th consecutive day, India has witnessed over a thousand daily deaths of which the last three days saw over 2,000 daily deaths.

I know we got it wrong. I know we made a mistake and for that I'm sorry and sincerely apologize,'' said Ford, who appeared to choke back tears at one point.But Ford said he won't resign despite widespread calls for him to do so.He also suggested his government will offer province-paid paid sick leave for Covid-19 patients, but announced no details. The lack of such a program has led to widespread complaints.The pandemic restrictions Ford's government announced last Friday immediately ran into opposition. Police departments insisted they wouldn't use new powers to randomly stop pedestrians or motorists and doctors complained the rules focused on outdoor activities like playgrounds and golf rather than more dangerous indoor settings.Restaurants, gyms and classrooms across the province already had been closed. Most nonessential workers are working from home.On Saturday, Ford retracted the ban on playgrounds, though outdoor recreation activities such as golf remain forbidden in Ontario, the only jurisdiction in North America that now bans it.Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada, but health experts say more-contagious variants and a failure to take the right measures against the virus has led to a third wave of infections in Ontario.Ford himself is isolating after a staff member tested positive.``Ford chose to walk people into a catastrophic third wave. He chose politics over public health. Today, he offered nothing,'' opposition New Democratic Party leader Andrea Horwath tweeted. ``Ford must pass paid sick days, close non-essential businesses & send vaccines to hotspots. Today.''"},

Top private hospitals like Apollo , Fortis, Max and Ganga Ram issued open appeals to the authorities to ensure timely delivery of the critical supply, citing the number of Covid patients who were dependent on it for their survival.However, smaller hospitals \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with lesser influence but equally worried about the Covid patients in their care \u00e2\u0080\u0094 were jittery and reaching a breaking point. Some of them began asking their patients to look for beds in other hospitals while stopping new admissions.\"We are supposed to give life. If we cannot give even oxygen, our patients will die,\" said Sunil Kumar Saggar , CEO of Shanti Mukand Hospital in Karkardooma, in a choked voice around 2.43pm on Thursday with his hospital left with just two hours of oxygen. He was anxious about the 110 Covid patients in their care.The crisis had started brewing at this 200-bed hospital around 3am. Out of the 110 Covid patients, 12 were on ventilator with one consuming 18 litres of oxygen per minute. Saggar, along with a couple of doctors, reviewed the situation and hoped to survive for some more hours, relying on the 1.7 metric tonnes of oxygen received from their vendor a day earlier. By 5am, more doctors had arrived. However, as the day progressed, the hospital realised it would soon run out of oxygen.The management reached out to ministers and several other people but to no avail. They then put new admissions on hold and started telling their patients to either arrange for a cylinder or shift them out. Even as Saggar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s video went viral, panic was setting in among the patients. \"We discharged five of them but told them we were trying to arrange supplies and if they felt unwell, they could come back later. Two other patients refused to leave and said they would wait and watch. The oxygen tanker finally arrived at 7.20pm. We had one patient who had crashed but we managed to save him. The supply we have received will keep us going for another 20 hours,\" said Saggar. He added that Delhi Police provided a green corridor for the tanker.Meanwhile, in Najafgarh, Rathi Hospital, which had 65 Covid patients, was also nervously watching its oxygen stock getting depleted. While Delhi Police officials had managed to arrange some for them on Wednesday, it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough. On Thursday morning, around 8am, the hospital sent out an SOS , asking for help. They also put out a tweet informing people that they would soon run out of oxygen.Speaking to TOI, hospital owner Dr Ankur Rathi, said: \"Almost 60-70% of our patients needed oxygen. We first thought we would start telling our patients to leave but realised there were no ambulances available and no oxygen cylinders to go with them. We realised it was a helpless situation either way, so we put out a tweet.\"The hospital spoke to the cops. \"It was a team effort and even our patients started looking out for vendors. By evening, we somehow managed to sail through but this is going to last only for seven to eight hours,\" said Rathi, indicating how nerve-wracking the entire exercise had become.Metro Hospital in Preet Vihar, which was taking care of 100 Covid patients, started shifting them out around 9.18pm after it ran out of oxygen. Dr Kousar A Shah, chief operating officer of Akash Hospital in Dwarka, said they have 233 Covid patients, of whom 75% were able to breath only because of oxygen support. \"We have only an hour of oxygen left. All my officials are running around begging for oxygen cylinders so that patients don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suffer,\" he said in an appeal to the government on Thursday afternoon.After being asked to look for admission elsewhere by Ishan Hospital in Rohini, family members of a patient summed up their predicament. \"It is like leaving a patient to die. There are no beds available anywhere else. We managed to get one here after pleading with the doctors and running around for four days. We cannot go anywhere and we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be here either knowing that the oxygen supply is limited.\"\"A patient who is on ventilator support will die within minutes if oxygen supply stops. Someone who is on high-flow oxygen may pull through for a while longer but not much. That is why there can be no delay due to any reason in the supply of oxygen,\" said Dr Sumit Ray, head of critical care at Holy Family Hospital in south Delhi. The hospital has more than 380 Covid patients on oxygen support.\"The situation is unprecedented and horrific. At one of our hospitals, the critical care specialists had to reduce the amount of oxygen being given to patients while they waited for the supply. There was no other way to keep the system running, but at the same time it posed a serious threat to the life of the patients. Our nurses and doctors are crying seeing the patients struggle to breathe due to a problem that can be easily solved through proper coordination,\" said an anguished doctor, who did not wish to be identified, at a top private hospital.Meanwhile, in Ghaziabad, Shanti Gopal Hospital in Indirapuram and Chandra Lakshmi Hospital in Vaishali were getting ready to discharge patients.At Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi, doctors said, as of 8pm on Thursday, they had only five hours of oxygen left. \"At present, 510 Covid patients are admitted and 142 of them are on high-flow oxygen support. If we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get timely replenishment of oxygen, there will be mayhem,\" said an official. Similarly, Batra Hospital in south Delhi had only two hours of oxygen left."},

In these circumstances, we direct that notices be issued to the Union government, state governments/Union Territories and the parties who appeared to have approached the high courts to show cause why uniform orders be not passed by this court in relation to supply of oxygen and essential drugs, method and manner of vaccination, and declaration of lockdown.\"The hearing also saw the bench cajoling the Tamil Nadu government to allow reopening of Vedanta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sterlite copper plant in Tuticorin specifically for producing 1,000 tonnes of medical oxygen. The plant was shut down because of violation of pollution norms.Referring to orders passed by the HCs of Delhi, Bombay, Sikkim, Calcutta, Allahabad and Gujarat, the bench said they had passed certain orders \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhich may have the effect of accelerating and prioritising the services to a certain set of people and slowing down the availability of these resources to certain other groups whether the groups are local, regional or otherwise\u00e2\u0080\u009d.The Delhi HC had on Wednesday told the Centre to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeg, borrow or steal\u00e2\u0080\u009d oxygen for supplying to Delhi hospitals. A few days ago, Allahabad HC had ordered the UP government to enforce complete lockdown in five major cities \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Lucknow, Prayagraj, Kanpur, Varanasi and Gorakhpur \u00e2\u0080\u0094 to contain the spread of Covid-19. The SC had stayed the order on April 20.The apex court bench asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to submit a national action plan by Friday morning. Mehta said the Centre was working round the clock to augment the supply of oxygen and mentioned an application by Vedanta seeking to restart its copper plant in Tuticorin only for the purpose of producing medical oxygen.Appearing for Vedanta, senior advocate Harish Salve said the plant could produce 1,000 tonnes of oxygen every day and Vedanta was ready to supply it to the government free of cost. \"If permitted, we can start production in five or six days,\" he said.But the Tamil Nadu government, through senior advocate K V Vishwanathan, said the plant was closed because of noxious discharge damaging the environment and it was not sure about the consequences on the environment by permitting reopening of the plant. He said the SC had earlier rejected Vedanta's plea for reopening of the plant, which was closed in 2018.Mehta said the country urgently needed medical oxygen supply. \"If there was a choice between saving the environment and human lives, the government would go for saving lives,\" he said. The bench cajoled the TN government and said it should not put a spoke in the production of oxygen and assured that it would judicially ensure that the plant operated only for producing oxygen. Vedanta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application will also be heard on Friday. The SC appointed Salve and advocate Anuradha Dutt as amici curiae in the proceedings on the national plan for Covid management."},

India for now has identified potential sources mainly in the Gulf and Singapore.Describing Covid-19 as a common enemy of all mankind that necessitated international solidarity and mutual assistance, the Chinese foreign ministry said Thursday Beijing had taken note of the recent \"grave situation in India with a temporary shortage of anti-epidemic medical supplies\".India had sourced medical equipment from China last year but mainly through commercial agreements. Both India and China have supplied Covid-19 vaccines to south Asian countries even though countries like Sri Lanka and Nepal started to accept Chinese vaccines only after supplies from India dried up. Faced with a grim domestic situation, India is no longer allowing vaccine export as it was earlier, even though it hasn't officially banned it.China was Thursday reported to have convened another meeting with countries in the region including Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka for a coordinated response to the pandemic. Apart from these 3 countries, the Maldives has also asked the Indian government to ensure that the Serum Institute of India honours the commercial agreements signed with them for the Covishield vaccine.In the case of Bangladesh, Dhaka had signed a contract for 30 million doses of the vaccine but, according to the Bangladesh media, Serum has supplied only 7 million doses since January.India ambassador to Bangladesh Vikram Doraiswami assured Dhaka Thursday that India was working on increasing the availability and supply of vaccines.Bangladesh too said Thursday that while it was making efforts to procure the remaining vaccines in accordance with the agreement signed with Serum, it was also making an effort to procure vaccines from China and Russia under a commercial agreement or joint production. \"Bangladesh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diplomatic missions in China and Russia are in communication with the governments of those countries as well as the vaccine manufacturing companies there,\" said Bangladesh foreign secretary Masud bin Momen."},

During this period, cases have surged at 6.76% daily, more than four times faster than a similar growth in daily numbers in the US \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the only other country that has recorded more than 1 lakh cases in a day.After the first peak in September, cases dipped for 30 straight weeks before they started rising again in mid-February.Experts and authorities believe that the overwhelming surge happened because people let their guard down and were lulled into believing that the worst of the pandemic was behind them.They add that India also failed to seize the opportunity to augment its healthcare infrastructure and vaccinate aggressively.\"We were so close to success,\" Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan who has been tracking India's pandemic, told AP.Virologist Shahid Jameel said that people let their guard down too early and opened up.\"We really didn't prepare in the time we got. As a result, the healthcare system is severely short-staffed right now ... the infrastructure is crumbling.\"Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor at an Australian university, said that people started to think they have escaped the pandemic, especially when it didn't hit the country as hard as everyone was expecting during the first wave.\"Now, of course, we are seeing a much more significant problem emerging, and you know, it could prove disastrous. You can't even vaccinate 1.2 billion overnight, it's just not possible even with all the best resources,\" he said.Professor Rijo M John from the Kerala-based Rajagiri College of social sciences said that the political leaders also share the blame due to their \"irresponsible statements\".\"Once the cases from the first wave began dropping and reached a low, there had been an overwhelming feeling among the general public that the worst was behind and they were out of danger. It was partly fuelled by irresponsible statements from several political leaders, many from the ruling government itself, leading people to inadvertently believe that India had defeated Covid. Perhaps, this may have lead them to engage in laxer behaviour,\" he said.Critics have also pointed to the government deciding not to pause religious festivals or elections despite the initial spike in infections, which may have exacerbated the surge.\"Authorities across India, without exception, put public health priorities on the back burner,\" said K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India.Meanwhile, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan refused to speculate why authorities could have been better prepared, saying: \"Today is not the time to go into why did we miss, or did we miss, did we prepare?\"Some experts said it is likely that the surge could be fueled by the presence of more infectious variants, which weren't there during the first wave.Late last year, scientists had detected a new variant, called B.1.617, with two mutations - the E484Q and L452R. This double mutant strain was first detected in Maharashtra.\"We cannot rule out the role of more infectious variants (homegrown and known imported variants) in different parts of the country. In most samples in Punjab, the UK variant is isolated, while the available evidence indicates the 'double mutant' strain is mostly prevalent in the state of Maharashtra. While it is known that the UK variant is more contagious, evidence regarding the Indian strain is yet to emerge,\" professor Giridhar Babu of Public Health Foundation of India said.Now, India has also detected a \"triple mutated\" variant of the virus, which has been found in samples collected from Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh.In fact, the Covid-19 virus that is doing the rounds in Bengal is increasingly being found to be an indigenous triple-mutation (B.1.618).\u00e2\u0080\u009cBengal strain\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as a scientist has dubbed it, might be more infective, and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something that experts find particularly worrying \u00e2\u0080\u0094 may be capable of escaping a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immune surveillance, even if that person was earlier exposed to a virus without this mutation, and even if vaccinated.There has, however, been no research yet to either corroborate or dismiss the fears over the new variants.It's hard to say but experts believe that India will hit its peak between May 11-15.Scientists working on a mathematical model to work out the course of the pandemic say there is a possibility of a peak between May 11-15 with 33-35 lakh total \u00e2\u0080\u0098active\u00e2\u0080\u0099 infections.This means the number of \u00e2\u0080\u0098active\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cases in India will keep increasing roughly for another three weeks before a decline.If the current model shows the trend correctly, the mid-May peak would be three time higher than the first peak of over 10 lakh \u00e2\u0080\u0098active\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cases witnessed on September 17 last year.The current model shows that Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Telangana may see a peak of 'new' cases during April 25-30; Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal during May 1-5 while Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh during May 6-10. It shows Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh might already have reached its peak phase now while Bihar will see it around April 25.India is faced with the massive challenge of trying to prevent its health care system from further collapse until enough people can be vaccinated to significantly reduce the flow of patients.The flood of new infections has already overwhelmed the healthcare system, with various hospitals as well as states reporting shortage of oxygen, ICU beds, ventilators and key drugs.The good news is that India is a major vaccine producer, but even after halting large exports of vaccines in March to divert them to domestic use, there are still questions of whether manufactures can produce enough fast enough.\"Vaccination is one way to slow down the spread - but this really depends on the speed and availability of the shots,\" said Reddy of the Public Health Foundation.India has so far administered jabs to over 13.23 crore of its population, which includes over 1.9 crore people who have been fully vaccinated."},

The highest increase has been made in the case of Kerala , with Delhi too seeing a 67% jump."},

Royals, with a team that hardly inspires confidence, are again looking good for bringing up the rear.The sixes that came off Padikkal's blade was more about timing than power as he hit 11 fours and six sixes during his knock.Picking the length of Mustafizur Rahaman's short ball and getting into the shape to execute a perfect pull-shot for a six showed why experts feel that it's only a matter of time before he dons national colours.The inside out chip off Riyan Parag over extra cover to complete his half-century off 27 balls, the sweep shots, the slash over backward point and the straight sixes with economy of footwork, were all testimony to his solid technical foundation.Once Padikkal was in his mid 80's, the RCB skipper chanced his arms including a six over extra cover off Royals' costliest buy Chris Morris.Kohli's 50 came off 34 balls and was followed by a personal milestone of 6000 runs in IPL as Royals surrendered way before the match officially ended.Earlier, Rahul Tewatia's impressive death overs hitting ensured a fighting 177 for 9 for Rajasthan Royals after yet another familiar top order no-show.On a good batting surface, Royals managed a total which may be 25 runs short but credit for the decent score goes to a counter-attacking effort from all-rounder Shivam Dube (46 off 32 balls) which stemmed the rot and big-hits from Tewatia (40 off 23 balls) that helped them get past 175-run mark.Dube smashed two sixes and five fours and with Riyan Parag (25 off 16 balls) giving him good support, added 66 runs for the fifth wicket off only 6.2 overs to give his team's total some semblance of respectability.While the giant all-rounder was comfortable playing at \"home\", using the pace of deliveries, the profligate top-order of Royals once again flattered to deceive along with their skipper Sanju Samson , who has been \"consistently inconsistent\".It took Dube's impressive effort to lend some muscle to the Royals' rickety-looking scorecard.For RCB, Mohammed Siraj's (3/27 in 4 overs) off-cutter first-up cleaned Jos Buttler (8) and Manan Vohra (7) , with another atrocious shot selection off Kyle Jamieson (1/28 in 4 overs), might have ensured a lengthy spell for himself in the dug-out.Siraj then unleashed a perfect toe-crusher for David Miller (0) as skipper Virat Kohli made a perfect call for DRS.Samson (21 off 18 balls), maintained his near decade-long IPL tradition of fizzling out after one or two good knocks as a six off Washington Sundar was followed by an indiscreet chip shot at mid-wicket.Dube's two sixes in one over from Yuzvendra Chahal (0/18 in 2 overs) over long-on forced Kohli to take his leg-spinner out of attack.Kane Richardson (1/29 in 3 overs) then denied Dube on what would have been a good half-century as Tewatia upped the ante in the final overs along with Chris Morris."},

We will hear it (plea of Vedanta) tomorrow,\" the bench said in the hearing conducted through video conferencing.\"The country is in dire need of oxygen and the Centre is augmenting oxygen from whichever source. Vedanta wants to make its plant operational, but let Vedanta only make it operational to manufacture oxygen for health purposes,\" solicitor general Tushar Mehta said.The Delhi high court on Thursday observed that the Covid-19 situation in the national capital has turned \u00e2\u0080\u009cprecarious\u00e2\u0080\u009d with many hospitals running out of oxygen and directed the Centre to ensure the gas is supplied to the city as per the planned allocation and without any hindrances.\"We all know that this country is being run by god,\" observed an anguish bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli which was of the view that all measures should be taken for removing obstructions in the transportation of oxygen.If the government wants it can do anything and can even make \u00e2\u0080\u009cheaven meet earth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it said.On Wednesday, the court had rebuked Centre over the oxygen crisis in Delhi and other cities, asking it to \"beg, borrow or steal\" to ensure that oxygen reaches hospitals.Several small hospitals in the city struggled to replenish oxygen supply for coronavirus patients on Thursday morning, even as some big healthcare facilities received fresh stock overnight.The Haryana government on Thursday allotted 140 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen produced in Panipat to the national capital.The move came after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sought help from his Haryana counterpartManohar Lal Khattar to facilitate the transport of oxygen trucks from Haryana to Delhi.\"I spoke to CM of Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar. Sought his support in facilitating the transport of oxygen trucks from Haryana to Delhi. He has assured full support,\" Kejriwal said in a tweet earlier in the day.Separately, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, alleging that tankers carrying oxygen were not able to reach hospitals in the national capital as they were being stalled by police and officials in UP and Haryana.With oxygen shortage gripping the national capital, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday asked the Delhi Police to create \"green corridor\" for all oxygen tankers from point of entry to designated destination.\"To monitor movement of oxygen tankers, Delhi Police will keep record of entry, exit of such vehicles through various checkpoints,\" it said.It has also set up a 24x7 control room to redress grievances and complaints from city hospitals regarding shortage within 30 minutes.Two senior IAS officers have also been appointed to ensure smooth movement of tankers and seamless supply to health establishments in DelhiIn an order, the DDMA has also directed all Delhi hospitals to form \"audit committees\" to supervise and rationalise the use of medical oxygen.The second wave of the Covid pandemic has seen an increased demand for oxygen as a significant number of people are suffering from Covid-induced respiratory complications.This has led to panic and people are trying to keep oxygen cylinders handy.As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director-general, Dr Balram Bhargava, the oxygen requirement in the second wave of Covid-19 stood at 54.5 per cent as compared to 41.5 per cent in the first wave.Bhargava also said that while the demand for oxygen has increased proportionately in the second wave, the demand for ventilator has not been high.However, experts have cautioned against the waste of oxygen by those who are taking it intermittently to boost their oxygen levels out of fear.According to AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, healthy individuals with oxygen saturation in the range of 93-94 per cent do not need to take high-flow oxygen just to maintain their saturation at 98-99 per cent.\"Oxygen is a treatment, it is like a drug,\" Guleria said to drive home the point that taking it intermittently is an absolute waste of oxygen.\"There is no data that shows that intermittent use of oxygen will be of any help to the patients and is, therefore, ill-advised,\" he added.Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman, Medanta Hospital, has urged people not to use oxygen as a \"security blanket\".According to Dr Devi Shetty, chairman, Narayana Health, oxygen saturation of above 94 per cent is not a problem and a doctor may be consulted if it dips after exercise or effortful work."},

While there could be different views among doctors about prescribing steroids, many of them are giving these drugs to some patients who continue to be ill even in the second week of Covid-19 infection. Presently, steroids are proving life savers for many who have defeated the virus on the basis of these drugs.But, while celebrating victory over Covid-19, one must remember the known side-effects of steroids and also techniques to safeguard from those side-effects. Doctors told TOI that patients who recovered from Covid-19 with the help of steroids may suffer from avascular necrosis, some six months to 2 years down the line. Secondly fungal infections like Mucormycosis are aggressively spreading in such patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a known fact that use of high-dose corticosteroids is a common cause of avascular necrosis. This necrosis occurs when blood flow to a bone is interrupted or reduced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said orthopedic surgeon Dr Aashay Kekatpure.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEarly diagnosis needs detailed clinical evaluation. The early changes in hip are seldom picked on X-ray, so MRI is considered the investigation modality of choice. Patients having history of diabetes, alcohol intake are more at risk of necrosis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.According to him, recovered patients of Covid treated with steroids needs to be attentive to joint pains and aches. They should not avoid any symptoms like pain in center on the groin, thigh or buttocks. If neglected, it may cost a hip joint replacement surgery.Another ill-effect of the Covid-19 steroids is fungal infection of sinuses leading to Fungal Sinusitis caused by Mucormycosis which can be grave. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith headache, nose blockage, black discharge from nose, tooth pain, loose teeth, facial pain, heaviness and facial swelling being chief and initial symptoms of the sinusitis, one must not ignore this at any point of time in this colossal Covid crisis,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr (Major) Vaibhav A Chandankhede, from ENT Department of IGGMCH.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary to report early for an early diagnosis and evaluation to minimise and control the disease of this opportunistic co-infection. As it just can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be delayed as neurological ailment or neglected for a usual headache. Treatment is both medical and surgical,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.TOI had reported on April 3 that mucormycosis cases are increasing in Nagpur since couple of months. They are accounting to 20 cases per 1,000 patients approximately."},

The redevelopment of the 1km long Variety Square-Loha Pul Square Sitabuldi main road envisages earmarking 84% of the road space for pedestrians.Currently, a major portion of the Sitabuldi main road is gobbled up by hawkers, moving and parked vehicles, roadside venders leaving a mere 5% for the pedestrians. This are findings of a study carried out under \u00e2\u0080\u0098Reimagining Sitabuldi Market\u00e2\u0080\u0099 proposal prepared by Sumit Asia Architects, Nagpur (SAA) and The Blank Slate (TBS), Mumbai.As winners of the Street for People Challenge (an initiative by Smart Cities Mission, MoHUA, Government of India), architects and urban designers from SAA and TBS aim to transform the bustling Sitabuldi market into a vibrant public space for Nagpurians to grow, pause, reflect and express.The main challenge in this competition rolled out by Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL) was to expand the potential of the street by proposing new activities while placing maximum focus on enhancing the shopping experience.The overflowing pedestrian movement, increased vehicular traffic and on-street parking leads to a chaos on the road for almost the entire day.Sagarika Nambiar, an architect at TBS, said that the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Vision Sitabuldi district\u00e2\u0080\u0099 untangles the existing chaotic system to create a dynamic, vibrant, secure, and inclusive shopping street that encourages walking and gathering.The 30-metre wide road has been divided into eight lanes with a major portion dedicated for pedestrians, followed by hawkers and a smaller patch for eco-friendly motor vehicles. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortunately, the immediate neighbourhood is well-equipped with secondary roads, vacant grounds (within 5-minute walking distance), and shared parking opportunities in the nearby malls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the study mentions.Applying a low-cost high-impact design strategy, as a salient feature of \u00e2\u0080\u0098tactical urbanism\u00e2\u0080\u0099, the distinct features were not only designed to allow better use of the street but also to provide a pleasant experience for the shoppers coming here. The safe and accessible crosswalks, a non-motorised vehicle (NMV) lane, e-rickshaw drop-off points, and pedestrian promenades are some features that figure in the proposed design.Also, there are provisions for an amenity plaza, dynamic linear park, pop-up events plaza, a hawkers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 plaza, and a food bazaar dispersed throughout the length of the street that offer new opportunities to expand the street\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potential to make it one of the most happening marketplaces of the city.The locally-sourced design materials (plastic crates, khadi fabrics used as shading devices, reusable tyre planters, etc, street patterns (concentric circles and morse codes), and repeated modules provide visual cohesion along the entire length of the street.\u00e2\u0080\u009cRunning in tandem with our design proposal and timeline, a mobile application is also proposed which is a one-stop solution for all things one might want to know about Sitabuldi Street. Along with this, the application will also aid in collecting valuable feedback and opinions from the public over a social interface, rather than manually doing so on-site, decreasing the risk factor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Nambiar.The proposal is to create a public space that transforms from an outdoor fitness zone in the early morning hours to a crowded market street offering a dual-natured shopping experience all through the day and finally offering food street or a cultural fiesta at night.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this transformation, we find a spark that ignites growth of a sustainable city and a city that is human-centric and nature-based,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.In response to the pandemic, the design has plans for measures such as a morse code pattern and circles spaced out by 6ft on the pedestrian walkway to ensure physical distancing, sanitization booths, and public toilets to ensure health and safety, acrylic screens on vendor carts for a safe shopping experience etc."},

Those working may have to adjust timing but between the 18 to 25 group can take the jab any time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nDr Arbat added that people are not coming for vaccination because of the lockdown.\n\nThey may venture out for silly reasons but will not go for vaccination. They should be motivated to take the jab,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n"},

Essential services have been defined as medical emergencies or people attending funerals. Violations would invite a fine of Rs 10,000.\n\nSecondly, the buses will have only two stoppages in cities and operator will have to put a stamp on the hand of alighting passengers for 14 days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 quarantine.

So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that we take all the necessary precautions to safeguard our students and even teachers from the virus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dably.A CBSE school teacher told TOI that some students did attend practicals even though they were positive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe come to know these things through their classmates. These kids anyway live their life on social media and so they always share such information either in a small Whatsapp group or during their group video calls to each other. Some of them will write on Instagram about parents becoming positive or a sibling. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing private about their lives anymore. So I am not speculating that positive students attended practicals, rather, I know it for a fact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the teacher.But since this information came a few days after the tests, teachers say they were helpless. Another teacher said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been telling our principals to make RT-PCR mandatory for all but they are more focussed on getting the practical exam over and done with. Now, these practical exams have been put on hold and I hope that the school management takes it seriously.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCBSE had earlier advised parents to take an \u00e2\u0080\u009ceducated view\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the issue. Speaking to TOI on this issue earlier, CBSE\u00e2\u0080\u0099s controller of examination Sanyam Bhardwaj said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cParents must be open about these things and inform the school if their child is positive. CBSE will not let any child suffer academically due to Covid-19. A second chance will be given, so no need to panic.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDably feels that voluntary disclosure won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no guarantee that people will tell the truth. So our best option is to get a test done and only the local authorities can enforce that. We will strongly plead with authorities to implement this rule before the practical exams restart,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dably."},

While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still to come \u00e2\u0080\u0098officially\u00e2\u0080\u0099 from Indian authorities, global attention is focusing on a new variant \u00e2\u0080\u0094 B.1.617 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that appears significantly more infectious in India. There is a theory that this variant emerged in Amravati , and caused the huge surge in cases in nearby districts in February.International researchers believe that this variant is typically of Indian origin . As a result, researchers and media houses from across the globe are now focusing on Vidarbha; and some of them even visited Nagpur while tracing the new \u00e2\u0080\u0098Indian variant\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different than the UK, or Africa or Brazil variant, which have been discussed at the start of this wave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, who has been receiving inquiries from many international researchers and journalists about the second wave in India.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMany countries have imposed travel ban to India. UK has added India into \u00e2\u0080\u0098red list\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of restricted destination. This is because specific variant of the virus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 B.1.617 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is becoming increasingly common,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr Shinde. He believes the Amravati surge was also due to this variant, though it needs to be confirmed with more research.As per the data shared by Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GSAID), B.1.617 was first found in samples collected in December 2020 in India. They have data of genome sequencing of Indian samples up to April 3, 2021. Until then, this variant was visible in 29% of the samples in India. According to doctors, it is responsible for the second wave and is now spreading across the country.GSAID is recognized for its importance to global health by G20 health ministers. In 2020, WHO called this data-science initiative \u00e2\u0080\u0098a game changer\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in Covid-19.Dr Atul Gawande, who hails from Umarkhed in Yavatmal district of Vidarbha, and is currently a member of Covid-19 control advisory team of US President Joe Biden , has also expressed his concerns about this variant while calling it as \u00e2\u0080\u0098extremely frightening\u00e2\u0080\u0099. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am seeing this variant go through entire households of my family in India. Whether it is more lethal, and whether vaccines work well against it, remains unclear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.As noted by Dr Gawande, it has been observed especially in Vidarbha that this variant is infecting entire families, unlike its predecessors in September 2020 wave. This means, the virus is significantly more infectious. But whether it is lethal or not is still to be studied. At present, the variant is \u00e2\u0080\u009cunder investigation\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It is still not designated a \u00e2\u0080\u0098variant of concern\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but scientists have recognized it as \u00e2\u0080\u0098variant of interest\u00e2\u0080\u0099.According to an initial study by Virology researcher Grace Roberts from Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s University, Belfast, this variant is estimated to be around 20% more transmissible than the earlier form of the coronavirus circulating during the first wave.However, officials in the ministry of health said that the rise in cases is not linked to the variant, as B.1.617 hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been detected in high enough quantities to determine whether it is directly responsible. However, experts think that this may be due to lack of data, and many have stressed the importance of increasing virus sequencing to get a better picture.The Indian VariantCovid-19 cases have risen sharply in India as new variant called B.1.617 has emergedB.1.617 is becoming increasingly common in India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cases, detected in second waveAmravati, and West Vidarbha, followed by Nagpur are identified as epicentre of B.1.617Due to this, global researchers have focused their attention on VidarbhaB.1.617 variant is more contagious, unlocks our cells, and skips pre-existing antibodies"},

The government has calculated district will be short of 45,305 beds as per projected cases and directed the authorities to ramp up the infrastructure.\n\nActive cases were 71,557 in the district on Wednesday. It means an increase of 52,123 by May 2 as per the projection. It also means the current surge continuing. The district is already having a severe shortage of oxygen beds. Situation of beds in ICU and with ventilators is even worse.\n\nAs per government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projection, the district will be short of 10,476 beds with oxygen, 1,945 ICU beds and 520 beds with ventilators. Remaining shortage of 32,364 beds is in isolation facilities or Covid Care Centres (CCCs).\n\nSince beginning of second wave, less than 1% of active patients have been in CCCs. The government had time and again directed the authorities to ensure 40% of patients are kept in CCCs for containing the spread and preventing deaths. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), district administration and Zilla Parishad (ZP) failed to comply with the directives saying patients were not ready to move into CCCs.\n\nAs against norm of having no more than 20% active patients in home isolation, the district has around 80%. Guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are making all efforts to increase the beds with oxygen supply. Two Jumbo Covid Hospitals with 1,600 beds and new Covid Hospitals are proposed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nInfectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccess to medical care is very necessary to control deaths. District should have been equipped with necessary number of beds by now as the second wave has lasted 12 weeks in other countries. We are witnessing second wave for last nine weeks and it is likely to go on until end of May. Vaccination and full lockdown are not likely to work as district is facing community spread. Need is to develop makeshift facilities where people can get oxygen, CT scan, diagnosis and treatment on time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nExcept Amravati, all districts of Vidarbha are likely to face severe shortage of beds as per projected active cases.\n\nActive cases in the district on April 19 (76,961) were 354% more than highest number in first wave (21,746). Among 35 districts in the state, Nagpur is at fourth place after Pune, Mumbai and Thane.\n\nTwo districts of Vidarbha- Bhandara and Chandrapur\u00e2\u0080\u0094 are on top as far as weekly growth rate of the cases is concerned. Weekly growth rate of Bhandara is 3.63% and Chandrapur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3.48%. For Nagpur it is 2.24%, probably due to high number of cases in last month. Except Yavatmal, Akola and Amravati, all districts of Vidarbha are in the red category in weekly growth rate.\n\nNagpur district (3,22,091) is second after Mumbai (4,11,998) in testing per million population. Bhandara (2,02,934) is fifth and Wardha (1,86,022) sixth. Remaining eight districts are in the red category due to less testing.\n\nThree Vidarbha districts Nagpur (35.02%), Gadchiroli (34.3%) and Gondia (33.23%) are in red category as far as weekly test positivity rate is concerned.\n\nAfter Kolhapur, Bhandara and Nagpur districts are in second and third place for vaccination of 45-plus population. Coverage is 41.48% (1,57,442 vaccinated against 3,79,532 eligible persons) in Bhandara district and 41% (6,48,541 vaccinated against 15,81,800 eligible persons) in Nagpur district.\n\n"},

Bus operators will have to stamp the passengers' hands to indicate they are supposed to stay at home for 14 days.On Thursday, police vans made rounds of the main streets in Mumbai asking people on the loudspeaker to stay home and avoid crowding.Police have put up barricades at the entry and exit gates of suburban railway stations to prevent unauthorised people from travelling in local trains.Police personnel manned the streets to check motorists and cars for the yellow, green and red stickers which are to be used for specific purpose while moving around during the period of restrictions.On Thursday, Maharashtra reported 67,013 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the tally to 40,94,840, while 568 more patients succumbed to the infection, said a health department official."},

They can take a break in the vanity van,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said additional police commissioner Dilip Sawant.\n\nThe biggest problem for personnel on bandobast is the lack of washrooms.

The duo was acquitted due to lack of evidence.\n\nKadawala, who was accused of transporting weapons to Mumbai on the instructions of Tiger Memon, was killed on February 7, 2001, in his Bandra office by three men. Two other accused were acquitted earlier in a separate trial. This is among the over 70 cases that the CBI took over after Rajan was deported from Bali in 2015. The 62-year-old, lodged in Tihar jail, is serving life sentence for the 2011 murder of journalist J Dey. Soon after Kadawala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s murder in 2001, an FIR was registered at Bandra police station. Investigations uncovered the role of an organised crime syndicate. Hence, provisions of the stringent MCOC Act were invoked. A chargesheet was subsequently submitted against Jaiswal, Nitin Sawant and Ashok Kotian. In the chargesheet, Rajan, Guru Satam and Yusuf Kadari alias Bachkana were shown as wanted accused. Kadari was arrested. During trial, Jaiswal and Sawant jumped bail. The trial proceeded against Kotian and Kadari and they were acquitted in 2004. Jaiswal was arrested in May 2017 and Sawant was reported to be dead. The CBI submitted a chargesheet against Rajan in 2019 and the trial commenced. The investigating agency alleged that Rajan wanted to gain public sympathy and avenge the blasts.\n\nLast year, the court rejected a plea by Kadawala\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son, who wanted a relative to be tried as an accused in the case on the grounds that Kadari had told the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family that the relative had given a contract for the murder. The motive was allegedly a property dispute.\n\nHowever, the court said though the murder took place in 2001, the family had not suspected involvement of the relative till 2017. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is difficult to gather from the evidence placed by the prosecution under what circumstances the acquitted accused made statement to the son of deceased and his friend and what prompted him to give such a statement after a lapse of 16 years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the court said.\n\n"},

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( TTD ) that manages the ancient shrine of Lord Venkateswara declared the place called Japali Theertham on Anjanadri as Hanuman Janmbhoomi on Wednesday on the occasion of Ram Navami following an eight-member expert committee submitted its report.\n\nDismayed by the development, Karnataka has decided to lay its claim with a renewed vigour that Hanuman was born on the hill also called Anjanadri in Kishkinda near Anegundi in Koppal districts, which abuts the heritage site of Hampi. However, authorities said Karnataka would not prefer confrontation with AP, but wants to settle the issue through consultation based on archaeological and mythological evidence.\n\n\"We don't know what made Andhra Pradesh raking up this issue suddenly. This comes at a time when the Karnataka government has embarked on a plan to develop Anjanadri in Kishkinda as a pilgrimage-tourist destination as this is the place that has been authentically identified as Hanuman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthplace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said KS Eswarappa, Karnataka minister for rural development and panchayat raj.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTirumala is a great pilgrimage centre and there is no dispute about its sthalapurana (ancient history). While we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to enter into a dispute with the AP government, we will study the evidence they are providing to prove their argument. We will ask experts to verify it and if needed we will seek a survey by the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) on the lines of the Varanasi court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to settle the matter over Kashi Vishwanath Temple,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eswarappa added.\n\nBased on many epic and mythological references including that of Ramayana \u00e2\u0080\u0099s chapters Kishkindha Kaand and Sundara Kaand, it was believed from ages that Kishkindha is the place where Ram and Lakshman met Hanuman as they came in search of Sita. It is also believed that Anjanadevi gave birth to Hanuman on a hill in Kishkindha and so the hillock got the name Anjanadri. The TTD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument is that Anajanadevi did tapasya in Tirumala, following which Hanuman was born and the hillock thus named Anjanadri and Hanuman later went to Kishkindha.\n\nThe stakeholders from both sides, however, hope the issue will be settled amicably since it does not involve religious dispute.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe made the declaration based on the available evidence that proves that Anjanadri in Tirumala is Hanuman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Janmabhoomi and Kishikindha was his karmabhoomi. We will place the records open in the public and it is subjected to discussion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said TTD executive officer KS Jawahar Redy.\n\nEswarappa was scheduled to lead a team of ministers- muzrai minister Kota Srinivas Poojari, tourism minister CP Yogeeshwara and Koppal in-charge minister BC Patil- Kishinda on April 16. The plan was to launch the project modernise the Hanuman temple on Anjanadri and develop Kishkinda with the modern tourist amenities. The programme was put off after Pooajri contracted covid.\n\n\"The programme will be rescheduled once the covid situation is improved. The plan is on to develop Kishkinda as Hanuman Janmabhoomi,\" said Poojarai.\n\nHanuman Janmabhoomi in Gokarna too\n\nRamachandrapura Mutt pontiff Raghaveshwara Bharathi, who is arguing that Hanuman was actually born in a cave near Gokarna in Uttar Kannada district, is holding on to his claim. The pontiff said his mutt will go ahead with its plan on Hanuman Janmabhoomi.\n\n\"We have already started renovating the temple in the cave with a cradle to the infant hanuman. The fully-developed Hanuman Janmbhoomi will be inaugurated by the next Ram Navami,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Raghaveshwara Bharathi.\n\n"},

Tanveer Ahmed of Mercy Angels, who was with the family from 4 pm till they completed the rites at around 2am, told TOI they had decided on the Kudlu Gate crematorium as he had seen only a few people there a day earlier.But when they reached the crematorium on Tuesday, they were in for a rude shock. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere were 15 vehicles ahead of us and many more joined up behind us shortly later. After a point, the workers had to close the gates and ask approaching vehicles to go elsewhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ahmed said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the time we completed the rites and returned home, it was 3.30am. In all, we spent almost 12 hours to cremate just one body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Ahmed said the wait to cremate bodies is only increasing by the day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne family took the body of a loved one to the Panathur crematorium and waited five hours. They then left and returned the next day at 6am to get the cremation done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother private ambulance I know of had gone to Sumanahalli crematorium at 12 noon and their turn came only at 11pm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ahmed said.Though each crematorium has two furnaces, Ahmed said technical issues cause even more delays. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrematorium workers are overburdened, and I have seen their workload increase in the past few weeks. In fact, I had formed a bond with them in the past year. Lately, they are so busy that they are unable to receive or return my calls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.He said some people also pull strings and jump the queue, which only adds to the waiting time and the frustration of other bereaved families. Sadiq Hussain , another Mercy Angel volunteer, has helped with 400-500 cremations and burials in the past year. He said the long wait at crematoria is like rubbing salt on people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wounds. He says the reasons for the long queue are the increase in the number of deaths and pressure on crematoriums. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes a minimum of one hour, sometimes 90 minutes, to burn one body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hussain said.It is not just the wait outside crematoria that is bothering bereaved family members. They also have to wait to find a vehicle to transport bodies from hospital to crematoria. Hussain said it is because of limited vehicles and an exponential number of deaths.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn addition, each vehicle is stuck at the crematorium for six to seven hours, creating an additional shortage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that he witnessed a man searching for a vehicle to carry a body from 8am to 2pm near a hospital in the city.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery day I see people going through such immense pain and hassle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hussain said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the lengthy procedure to release bodies at hospitals to massive queues at crematoria. What we do is service, but there needs to be some support and intervention from the government.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAhmed said one solution is to create temporary crematoria to take the load."},

The flash strike paralysed bus services across Karnataka as nearly 1.3 lakh STU staffers rallied behind Kodihalli Chandrashekar , president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha .A majority of the employees who were part of KSRTC Staff and Workers' Federation, which is affiliated to AITUC , joined the Chandrashekar-led Karnataka State Road Transport Employees' League. Buoyed by the December protest's response, the league issued a 21-day notice before the April strike seeking implementation of pay revision according to the 6th Pay Commission .However, the notice only gave the transport department ample time to be prepared. It roped in private bus operators and allowed them to run without permits across the state and also opened up government bus terminals to them. The government maintained implementation of the salary revision would translate into a 30% hike, which was not feasible, and offered an 8-10 per cent increase instead. However, it was not acceptable to the union leaders.Some employees alleged union leaders left them in the lurch. \"We should have at least agreed for a 10% hike, but now we are nowhere. They may take stringent action against us once we resume duty,\" rued a BMTC conductor.Transport department officials said they decided not to go for negotiations. \"This is probably for the first time in the history of STUs that an indefinite strike ended without negotiations. They haven't achieved anything. We decided not to succumb to pressure since they were too demanding and arrogant,\" said a senior transport department official.While employees' demand for salary revision was genuine, many felt a strike during a pandemic was untimely. \"We thought they would go for a 3-5-day strike but it lasted 15 days, the longest in the history of STUs in Karnataka. The government was ready to give at least an 8% hike, but they are unlikely to get it now,\" said the official.A union leader said the second Covid wave stumped them. \"We were not allowed to stage protests anywhere, including Freedom Park. Also, the government didn't give March salary to employees. It took action against workers. But we continued till the high court intervened in the matter on Tuesday,\" he added.STUs, meanwhile, gradually scaled up their operations as days passed. \"We have been improving our schedules despite protesters' threats. The strike had fizzled out even before they called it off. This is a setback for both STUs and employees. For the first time, Majestic bus terminuses saw so many private buses. It will also encourage the call for privatisation of transport services,\" said another official."},

With night curfew in place, highway patrol police are being deployed at entry and exit points in districts. At least half a dozen highway patrol vehicles monitor national and state highways round the clock. Their services are mostly restricted to checkposts during curfew hours, say police.\n\n\"Local police assist us but we have to scan vehicles entering and exiting the district,\" said a senior officer from Tumakuru district, adding: \"Since we are on the Bengaluru border, we get more vehicles entering and exiting the city.

The state produced 154 lakh tonnes, an all-time record, as against 141 lakh tonnes in 2019-20. This is 30 per cent more than the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average food production of 115 lakh tonnes. Cereals accounted for 132 lakh tonnes and pulses the rest. Separately, the state recorded the highest production of oilseeds (13 lakh tonnes). This is mainly because there was a shortage of labour. Oilseeds don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require a lot of labour, which made them many farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 preferred choice.How did Karnataka, which is prone to drought, floods and landslides, manage these numbers? \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of fairly widespread rainfall that covered around 65 per cent of the state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said state agriculture commissioner Brijesh Kumar Dikshit. He added that good rain in arid districts such as Tumakuru, Chitradurga , Chikkaballapur and Kolar also boosted food production.According to the state agriculture department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data, farmers planted winter (rabi) crops on nearly 50 lakh hectares , which is nearly 30 per cent higher than normal. The total area of sowing during the kharif, rabi and summer seasons touched 116 lakh hectares, which increased the chances of a bumper harvest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHigher sowing during the rabi season was mainly on account of robust rains in October,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dikshit.The agriculture sector, which accounts for 50 per cent of the rural economy, was also able to shake off the impact of Covid-19 because of ample subsidised inputs such as fertilisers under the Atma Nirbhar package. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring the peak pandemic months last year, the farm sector was the only bright spot in the state economy.

People don\u2019t like to meet doctors because they\u2019re scared. So we\u2019re socially isolated too.

RV Prasad, former Bosch employee and resident of Mathikere, fell ill and submitted his swab sample at the primary health centre on Sunday.

The advisory came at a time when companies say they are seeing higher Covid-related claims because private hospitals are denying the cashless facility and are overusing antibiotics.\n\nUnion finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman too tweeted about this on Thursday evening saying: \u00e2\u0080\u009cReports are being received of some hospitals denying cashless insurance. Spoken to chairman, IRDAI SC Khuntia to act immediately. In March\u00e2\u0080\u009920 Covid included as a part of comprehensive health insurance.

Bhabtosh Mishra, director underwriting, products & claims at Max Bupa Health Insurance, pointed out that during the first wave, the average length of a Covid patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stay in hospital was around 10 days. It dropped to seven days by the end of December 2020.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe average claims (in the first wave) used to be around Rs 1.3 lakh. However, in the second wave, while the average number of days of hospitalisation is still hovering around seven days, the claim size has increased to over Rs 1.4 lakh,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor instance, unlike last year, we are seeing use of high-end antibiotics, like injection Meropenem and Targocid, without providing much justification of its use. This has led to an increase in the overall size of claims,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nAn official of an insurance company, who did not wish to be identified, said fraud claims management has also become a major issue as they have begun to see instances of false positive reports and cases of false hospitalisations.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn times of Covid, it becomes very difficult to physically visit hospitals and verify cases where we have doubts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the official said.\n\nS Prakash, MD, Star Health and Allied Insurance said the lack of adherence to standardised treatment protocols is a major concern and this is not only burdening insurance players but patients as well.\n\nThe head of a general insurance player also pointed out that there is a lot of panic among people as a result of which many are occupying beds when they do not need to.\n\nAnother health insurance player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s official pointed out that they have come across cases where customers, despite sharing their single occupancy rooms with other patients due to lack of beds, were being charged single occupancy room rent, resulting in higher claims.\n\nEven Sanjay Datta, chief-underwriting, claims and reinsurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, added that it is not only about high Covid claims. He said overall health insurance claims are rising because many who had postponed health procedures last year have started going for it.\n\n"},

I know we got it wrong. I know we made a mistake and for that I'm sorry and sincerely apologize,'' said Ford, who appeared to choke back tears at one point.But Ford said he won't resign despite widespread calls for him to do so.He also suggested his government will offer province-paid paid sick leave for Covid-19 patients, but announced no details. The lack of such a program has led to widespread complaints.The pandemic restrictions Ford's government announced last Friday immediately ran into opposition. Police departments insisted they wouldn't use new powers to randomly stop pedestrians or motorists and doctors complained the rules focused on outdoor activities like playgrounds and golf rather than more dangerous indoor settings.Restaurants, gyms and classrooms across the province already had been closed. Most nonessential workers are working from home.On Saturday, Ford retracted the ban on playgrounds, though outdoor recreation activities such as golf remain forbidden in Ontario, the only jurisdiction in North America that now bans it.Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada, but health experts say more-contagious variants and a failure to take the right measures against the virus has led to a third wave of infections in Ontario.Ford himself is isolating after a staff member tested positive.``Ford chose to walk people into a catastrophic third wave. He chose politics over public health. Today, he offered nothing,'' opposition New Democratic Party leader Andrea Horwath tweeted. ``Ford must pass paid sick days, close non-essential businesses & send vaccines to hotspots. Today.''"},

The renewed jump in Covid infections in several parts of the country and the associated localised and regional lockdowns add uncertainty to the growth outlook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the governor said in the minutes of the MPC (monetary policy committee) meeting, which was released by the RBI on Thursday.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn such an environment, monetary policy should remain accommodative to support, nurture and consolidate the recovery. We need to continue to sustain the impulses of growth in the new financial year 2021-22. I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Das had said.While the RBI expectedly kept rates on hold, it had surprised markets by announcing a Rs 1-lakh-crore government bond purchase programme, which helped bring down interest rates. While the RBI did reiterate its accommodative stance while announcing the MPC decision, a reading of the minutes emphasises the dovish stance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing forward, The RBI would continue to ensure ample surplus systemic liquidity and the system would remain in surplus even after meeting the requirements of all financial market segments and the productive sectors of the economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Das had said in the MPC meeting.He had said that indicators suggest that the real GDP was evolving on the lines of the February MPC resolution.\u00e2\u0080\u009cImproving demand conditions, investment enhancing measures by the government and improving external demand impart an upside to growth prospects. The recent jump in Covid infections and its impact on economic activity, however, needs to be watched carefully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Das had cautioned.Deputy governor Michael Patra had also expressed concern over recovery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonetary policy has to remain supportive of the economy until the recovery is more sure-footed and its sustainability assured,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He pointed out that risks to the recovery have become accentuated since the MPC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s February meeting with new waves of infections and the inexorably slow pace of vaccinations, moderation in several high-frequency sentiment indicators, global risks and spillovers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe economic recovery can come under risk if this new wave of infections is not flattened soon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mridul Saggar, executive director, RBI and a member of the MPC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is especially so as monetary and fiscal policies have already used most of their space to considerably limit the loss of economic capital, though expansion of policy toolkits can still afford additional comfort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added."},

Lenders said, unlike last year when they got additional credit lines and relief in the form of a moratorium , small businesses do not have enough cash to see them through a prolonged shutdown.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile it is too early to comment on the extent of the impact on the asset quality of retail loans due to the rising Covid cases, there is reason to be cautious. After the nationwide lockdown last year, we had witnessed a severe drop in collections for most asset classes though the availability of a moratorium provided a breather from an NPA-recognition perspective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abhishek Dafria, VP and head (structured finance) at Icra.\n\nDafria added that while the current restrictions are localised and less harsh, the severity has been gradually increasing as the surge in Covid cases is yet to be brought under control. Pointing out that last year it was microfinance and unsecured SME loans that had the highest delinquencies after the lockdown period, he said that the risk categorisation would remain similar for areas that see stronger government restrictions.\n\nAccording to lenders, they would be helpless if the loans slip into non-performing asset ( NPA ) category as then no further relief can be given and they would have to initiate recovery proceedings. Last year, in addition to the moratorium and emergency credit line, a SC order had prevented banks from classifying delinquencies after the Covid outbreak as NPAs.\n\nSince default by small businesses could result in credit freeze to this segment, the RBI might be forced to look at a moratorium if the lockdown restrictions get extended geographically and extend for a longer period.The Finance Industry Development Council, which represents NBFCs, has written to the RBI seeking an extension of the one-time restructuring of MSME advances till March 2022, as the companies are yet to revive their businesses due to the surge in Covid cases.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDue to the severe second wave of COVID-19, the MSMEs as also the retail and wholesale trader industry have not been able to revive their economic activities and therefore are in urgent need of support from the lenders. Various surveys and reports are forewarning that the operating environment for banks will most likely remain challenging, as the second wave could dent the sluggish recovery in consumer and corporate confidence, and further, suppress banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prospects for new business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the council said in its letter to the RBI governor.\n\nAccording to bankers, the combination of moratorium and emergency credit line guarantee scheme in the previous year helped to protect banks, NBFCs and small businesses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLast year, the additional line of credit enabled some of the small business to clear expensive loans to NBFCs and the moratorium provided relief until business started.

Realtors warned that expensive homes could become a permanent feature of the market, worsening inequality.\n\nEven as the economy is booming and the labor market scars are healing thanks to massive public aid from the government and increased Covid-19 vaccinations, there are still 17.4 million people collecting unemployment checks.\n\n\"We are seeing claims drop across most states, which shows the jobs recovery has become more geographically broad-based,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.\n\n\"However, a growing number of Americans are out of work for longer, and it's those who are tougher to bring back into the labor force.\"\n\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 39,000 to a seasonally adjusted 547,000 for the week ended April 17, the lowest since mid-March 2020, the labor department said.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast 617,000 applications for the latest week.\n\nIt was the second straight week that claims were below the 700,000 level since March 2020 when mandatory shutdowns of non-essential businesses like restaurants and bars were enforced to slow the first wave of Covid-19 infections.\n\nThere were large declines in filings in Texas and New York, as well as decreases in several other states.\n\nClaims have remained elevated because of fraud, especially in California and Ohio. The enhancement of the unemployment benefits programs, including a weekly $300 subsidy, could also be encouraging some people to attempt to file a claim for assistance, though not every application is approved.\n\nThe latest labor department data on first payments show only a fraction of claims were successful over the past months.\n\nThe weekly subsidy and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program will run through September 6. Claims jumped to a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.\n\nIncluding the PUA program, 699,798 people filed claims last week, squeaking below 700,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\n\nStocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.\n\nBroad improvement\n\nThe United States has expanded Covid-19 vaccination eligibility to most American adults, and more than half that population has had at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A third of US adults are fully vaccinated, as well as 26% of the population overall, it said.\n\nThat, together with the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, has allowed for broader economic re-engagement. The resulting surge in demand has left businesses scrambling for workers. Retail sales raced to a record high in March and factories are humming.\n\nLast week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. First-time filings have dropped from 765,000 in mid-March, boosting hopes for strong employment gains in April.\n\nThe economy created 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months. Employment, however, remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.\n\n\"Job growth in the spring of 2021 is receiving a boost as better weather allows for more outdoor activity,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Job growth will remain very strong throughout 2021 and into 2022 thanks to vaccination efforts and stimulus payments that are supporting consumer spending.\"\n\nBut the housing market is backpedaling. Existing home sales dropped 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.01 million units last month, the lowest level since August 2020, the National Association of Realtors said in a separate report on Thursday.\n\nThe plunge reflected a supply squeeze, which boosted the median house price a record 17.2% from a year ago to an all-time high of $329,100.\n\nSales are skewed towards large and more expensive homes. The NAR reported intense bidding wars, which it said could lead to discrimination against some buyers.\n\n\"Without an increase in supply, the society wealth division will widen with homeowners enjoying sizable equity gains while renters will struggle to become homeowners,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR.\n\nStill, housing remains supported by the recovering labor market. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 34,000 to 3.674 million in the week ended April 10.\n\nThe so-called continuing claims have declined from 23.1 million at the height of the crisis. Part of the drop is likely because of people finding work and exhausting their eligibility for benefits, which is limited to 26 weeks in most states.\n\nAbout 5.6 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended April 3. Another 492,999 were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid. There were 17.405 million people receiving benefits under all programs in early April.\n\n"},

Read More\n\nATLANTA: The board overseeing an Atlanta area park that has centuries-old ties to the Ku Klux Klan and contains the largest Confederate monument ever crafted will be headed for the first time by an African American.\n\nGov. Brian Kemp on Wednesday announced that he had appointed the Rev. Abraham Mosley to serve as chairman of the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, the state authority responsible for overseeing Stone Mountain Park about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta. The park is a popular hiking and tourist site but is replete with Confederate imagery.\n\nMosley, pastor of Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Athens, Georgia, was previously a member of the association's board. His elevation to chairman comes as the park's Confederate symbols face renewed opposition, with some calling on park leaders to stop maintaining its signature feature - a colossal sculpture of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson that is carved into the mountain's northern face.\n\nAssociation CEO Bill Stephens told WSB-TV the board will hear ideas at a meeting on Monday about how to change the park in ways he thinks will balance its historical record.\n\nMosley urged patience.\n\n\"Certainly, there are mounting problems that have been brought before us. But we've got to handle them one at a time,\" he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nKemp said in a statement that he was confident Mosley would \"continue to rely on his experience in bringing people together\" as chairman of the association.\n\nThe Stone Mountain Action Coalition, an advocacy group, last year proposed that the association remove Confederate flags at the base of the mountain, change the names of streets and other park features with Confederate affiliations and refocus the park on themes such as racial reconciliation and justice. Meymoona Freeman, a leader of the group, said it wanted to see the carving of Lee, Davis and Jackson transformed into a natural space. The sculpture has special protection enshrined in Georgia law, which calls on the Stone Mountain Memorial Association to protect the site as a \"Confederate Memorial and public recreation area,\" according to the association's website.\n\nThe Stone Mountain Action Coalition said in a statement it was \"encouraged\" by Mosley's appointment.\n\n\"It is our hope that the appointment of Reverend Mosley to this position of leadership is the first of many changes at this public park that will result in the immediate and complete removal of symbols, monuments, flags, street, place and building names, events and activities that honor and celebrate the Confederacy and the Ku Klux Klan,\" the Stone Mountain Action Coalition said in a statement.\n\n"},

Read More\n\nKABUL: The US military has begun shipping equipment and winding down contracts with local service providers ahead of the May 1 start of the final phase of its military pullout from Afghanistan , a US Defense Department official said Thursday.\n\nThe pullout under US President Joe Biden marks the end of America's longest war after a 20-year military engagement. Currently, some 2,500 US soldiers and about 7,000 allied forces are still in Afghanistan.\n\nIn February last year, the US military began closing its smaller bases. In mid-April, the Biden administration announced that the final phase of the withdrawal would begin May 1 and be completed before Sept. 11.\n\nSince then, the military has been shipping equipment and winding down local contracts for services such as trash pickup and maintenance work, the US official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations.\n\nWhile preparations are under way, troops likely won't begin to depart for a few weeks, he said, adding that \"we won't see a coming down of the (troop) numbers\" until remaining bases close.\n\nThere have been indications that the pullout could be completed well before Sept. 11, which marks the 20th anniversary of the al-Qaida terror attack on the U.S. and the trigger for the US invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nOn Wednesday, Germany's Defense Ministry said discussions are underway among military planners with the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Kabul for a possible withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan as early as July 4.\n\nIn the short term, America will likely increase its troop presence in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said last Friday. The additional troops would be in Afghanistan over the coming weeks and months to help with what the herculean task of wrapping up 20 years of war.\n\nWhile much of the equipment headed back to the US will be shipped by air, the military will also use land routes through Pakistan and north through Central Asia, the Defense Department official said.\n\nThe U.S. equipment that is neither shipped back to America nor given to the Afghan National Security forces will be sold to contractors, who will, in turn, sell it in the local markets.\n\n\"You'll most likely start seeing it eventually showing up in bazaars as scrap,\" said the official.\n\nThe Taliban, meanwhile, were non-committal when asked by the AP whether the insurgents would attack departing US and NATO troops. \"It's too early for these issues, nothing can be said about the future,\" said Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem.\n\nIn a deal the Taliban signed last year with former President Donald Trump , the final US withdrawal deadline was set as May 1. Under the agreement, the Taliban promised not to attack US and NATO troops but they also later promised \"consequences\" if Washington defied the May 1 deadline.\n\n"},

Read More\n\nWASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Thursday pledged to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 52 per cent by the end of this decade. With this, Biden reverses the hands-off policy of his isolationist and science-sceptic predecessor Donald Trump , restoring a global approach in an interdependent world in the throes of a pandemic.\n\nForty world leaders -- including heads from China, India, Russia, Japan, and UK -- pitched their views and ideas at a virtual summit where Biden, introduced by his vice-president Kamala Harris, called the need for addressing global warming \"a moral imperative, an economic imperative.\"\n\n\"The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. The cost of inaction is mounting,\" he said in his opening remarks, vowing that US would do its part to cut its 2005 level emissions by 50 to 52 per cent by 2030. He further asserted that his approach will create jobs and boost economies.\n\nThe White House said the US President's goal roughly doubles a target set by President Barack Obama in 2015 as part of the Paris climate accord, and he plans to formalise the new goal in a submission to the United Nations.\n\nBiden's pledge will require a fundamental change in the \"American way of life\" cherished by the country's nativist base, premised on unsparing and uncaring use of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons. A $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan which includes a clean energy standard to achieve net zero emissions in the power sector by 2035 and money to electrify the vehicle fleet are among the steps the Biden administration had proposed. The plan triggered resentment in mostly Trumpian circle of climate change sceptics which believes Washington should not worry about the rest of the world and simply do what is best for the American economy that thrives on consumption.\n\nIllustrative of the common global concern on the issue despite severe differences on other matters, leaders of Russia, China, India, Japan, Canada, UK and others -- many with serious on-going bilateral spats -- joined the virtual summit to broadly align themselves with the overall goal of reducing emissions.\n\nBiden, who spoke from the East Room of the White House decorated with plants and greenery on the occasion of Earth Day , was later joined by Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and climate czar John Kerry as Washington returned to a leadership role to tackle a global crisis that has momentarily taken a backseat due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand all of us, all of us and particularly those of us who represent the world's largest economies. We have to step up,\" he said in words that could well apply to the pandemic.\n\nIn his speech, Prime Minister Modi made no new commitments but announced an India-US climate and clean energy partnership to mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies, and enable green collaborations. He also maintained that India's per capita emissions are far smaller than other major emitters -- a pointed rebuttal to global powers often putting China, which has five times more emissions than India, in the same basket.\n\n"},

I know we got it wrong. I know we made a mistake and for that I'm sorry and sincerely apologize,'' said Ford, who appeared to choke back tears at one point.But Ford said he won't resign despite widespread calls for him to do so.He also suggested his government will offer province-paid paid sick leave for Covid-19 patients, but announced no details. The lack of such a program has led to widespread complaints.The pandemic restrictions Ford's government announced last Friday immediately ran into opposition. Police departments insisted they wouldn't use new powers to randomly stop pedestrians or motorists and doctors complained the rules focused on outdoor activities like playgrounds and golf rather than more dangerous indoor settings.Restaurants, gyms and classrooms across the province already had been closed. Most nonessential workers are working from home.On Saturday, Ford retracted the ban on playgrounds, though outdoor recreation activities such as golf remain forbidden in Ontario, the only jurisdiction in North America that now bans it.Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada, but health experts say more-contagious variants and a failure to take the right measures against the virus has led to a third wave of infections in Ontario.Ford himself is isolating after a staff member tested positive.``Ford chose to walk people into a catastrophic third wave. He chose politics over public health. Today, he offered nothing,'' opposition New Democratic Party leader Andrea Horwath tweeted. ``Ford must pass paid sick days, close non-essential businesses & send vaccines to hotspots. Today.''"},

The rate of growth in Afghanistan could enhance by two per cent in a stable and connected Afghanistan, we have to work together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, there are two options\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Connect to Central Asia through us, share in the joint prosperity through the partnership for peace, gain international credibility and support that they're all in need of, or opt for chaos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nThe country that would be most damaged by insecurity or a renewed civil war in Afghanistan is Pakistan, and in that case, it would be a lose proposition, Ghani said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's a moment of choice for Pakistan. All its calculations have been wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Afghanistan President said.\n\nAfghanistan has in the past accused Pakistan of providing safe havens for terror groups that target its territory, especially the Afghan Taliban , the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and the Haqqani group.\n\nResponding to a question, Ghani said that China is not an interventionist power.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does not want to get engaged with military or proxy wars, and Pakistan in terms of its foreign policy obviously is hedging between China and other countries, because it is still, its reliance on the rest of the region is quite significant. Pakistan can become an anchor of regional stability if it opts for peace in regional cooperation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nThe discourse of Pakistan has changed, he said, adding that there was a security conference in Islamabad where the talk was really significantly about harmony and cooperation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo expect that China, after the great COVID reset and the significant adverse impact will get involved in regional conflicts directly, I think is remote. Furthermore, we have a lot of positive relationships with China and the growth of China now is going to be the factor as growth of India for regional prosperity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of us are strong stakeholders not to get involved. And for Afghanistan, we do not want a replacement in terms of seeking to replace the United States and NATO with some form of patronage. We want to have a multi-aligned policy where we are friends with everybody and not part of their quarrels, and hence our agenda of permanent neutrality that will benefit everybody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ghani said.\n\nResponding to a question on the withdrawal of US troops from his country by September 11, he said that this is a time of opportunity for Afghanistan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the Taliban and for Pakistan, it's a moment of choice. Will they opt to become a credible international stakeholder, with rules of game for a peaceful part of Asia and connectivity, or for opting for chaos?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEqually for the Taliban, the major excuse that this is a war to get the international forces out of Afghanistan is over. There is no religious justification left for the war. Political settlement is a must.

The India-UK relationship could play a significant role in the containment of these practices,\" it states. \"The potential for the UK to use the ETP, and even the launch of FTA negotiations to lock the Indian government into a broader coalition of willing partners could be a game-changer for the Indo-Pacific region.\"\n\nThe UK, India and the existing CPTPP countries constitute around half of the global economy.\n\n\"Many countries have sought to do a trade deal with India, but these have proved notoriously difficult to close. It is possible that the UK has the key to unlock the Indian puzzle,\" Singham writes.\n\nHe states an FTA would have commercial benefits to both countries. The UK would like to see Scotch whisky tariffs reduced and greater access for UK financial, legal and professional services in India. India wants the UK to be more accommodating of business and student visas, in particular for IT executives. If the UK lowers its tariff schedule further below the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Common External Tariff and diverges from EU bans on products, then Indian agriculture could substantially benefit too, it adds.\n\nBut the report warns that FTAs are \"irrelevant if the rule of law and contracts are flouted, or if anticompetitive market distortions are the order of the day\".\n\nCiting the cases of Vodafone, Cairn Energy and Devas Multimedia Pvt Ltd, the report raises concerns that the Indian government is \"systematically breaking bilateral investment treaties (BITs), ignoring court and arbitration rulings, cancelling contracts, expropriating private property and using state institutions to prosecute the very parties whose rights they should be protecting\".\n\nSingham urges Johnson in his talks with Modi to push the Indian government to recognise and respect its existing commitments under bilateral investment treaties.\n\n\"Future British investors in India will expect the Indian government to abide by the BIT, including arbitration judgments. If this cannot be certain, then why would any investor feel confident about the provisions of a future FTA?\" the report asks.\n\n"},

Read More\n\nMOSCOW: Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said in an emotional message from behind bars Thursday that he felt \"pride and hope\" after learning from his lawyer about the mass protests demanding his freedom that swept Russia the previous night.\n\n\"Here it is - the salvation of Russia. You. Those who came out. Those who didn't come out but supported it. Those who didn't support it publicly, but sympathized,\" Navalny said in an Instagram post.\n\nThe 44-year-old, who is in his fourth week of hunger strike, said he hadn't known \"what was really happening\" because he only has access to one TV channel in prison, but his lawyer visited him on Thursday and got him up to speed about the events on Wednesday. \"And, I will sincerely say, two feelings are raging inside me: pride and hope.\"\n\n\"People are marching in the street. It means they know and understand everything,\" said Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin 's most prominent opponent. \"They won't give up their future, the future of their children, their country. Yes, it will be difficult and dark for some time. But those pulling Russia back historically are doomed. There are more of us in any case. Russia will be happy.\"\n\nMass street protests in support of Navalny swept dozens of cities and smaller towns across Russia on Wednesday night. The largest crowds were seen in Moscow, where thousands marched down the city center amid a heavy police presence.\n\nUnlike on past occasions, officers in riot gear didn't interfere with the rally in the Russian capital, allowing quickly growing crowds to swarm streets and squares for several hours. According to OVD-Info, a rights group that monitors political arrests and offers legal aid, police detained only 31 people in Moscow, which usually accounts for the vast majority of arrests across the country.\n\nBut overall, OVD-Info tallied more than 1,900 arrests across the country on Wednesday night, with more than 800 occurring in St. Petersburg.\n\nIt was unclear whether the demonstrations matched the size and intensity of the nationwide protests that broke out in January after Navalny was arrested.\n\nLeonid Volkov, Navalny's top strategist and chief of staff, maintained in the YouTube live stream about the protests that Wednesday's turnout exceeded January's, while the number of arrests was several times lower.\n\nIndependent political analyst and former Kremlin speechwriter Abbas Gallyamov believes the turnout on Wednesday was somewhat comparable to that in January, indicating that the harsh crackdown that followed previous demonstrations hasn't scared off Navalny's supporters.\n\nHundreds of people were jailed in the aftermath of the January demonstrations, and a number of Navalny allies were slapped with criminal charges for allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions.\n\n\"In recent months, the authorities have made very serious attempts to (discourage protests) by tightening the screws, and many - including me - had serious concerns that much fewer people would turn up,\" Gallyamov told The Associated Press Thursday.\n\nNavalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin - accusations Russian officials reject.\n\nSoon after, a court found that the politician's stay in Germany violated the terms of his suspended sentence for a 2014 embezzlement conviction, and ordered him to serve 2 1/2 years in prison.\n\nNavalny began the hunger strike to protest prison authorities' refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and numbness in his legs. Officials insisted Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs.\n\nNavalny's doctors said last week that the politician's test results showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys. He \"could die at any moment,\" his physician Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin said in a Facebook post.\n\nNavalny's allies had called the Wednesday protest in light of the alarming news, saying his life was at stake.\n\n"},

Read More\n\nJERUSALEM: A Syrian anti-aircraft missile landed in southern Israel early Thursday, setting off air raid sirens near the country's top-secret nuclear reactor, the Israeli military said. In response, it said it attacked the missile launcher and air-defense systems in neighboring Syria.\n\nIsraeli media later described the Syrian missile as an \"errant\" projectile, not a deliberate attack deep inside Israel. In recent years, Israel has repeatedly launched air strikes at Syria, including at military targets linked to foes Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, both allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Such strikes routinely draw Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Thursday's exchange was unusual because the Syrian projectile landed deep inside Israel.\n\nSyria's state news agency SANA said the exchange began with an Israeli air strike on Dumeir, a suburb of the capital of Damascus . Dumeir is believed to house Syrian army installations and batteries as well as bases and weapons depots belonging to Iran-backed militias. SANA said four soldiers were wounded.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , an opposition war monitoring group based in Britain that tracks Syria's civil war, said the Israeli strikes hit an air defense base belonging to the Syrian military and destroyed air defense batteries in the area. It said the Syrian military fired surface-to-air missiles in response.\n\nSyrian media made no mention of an anti-aircraft missile landing deep inside Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military described the projectile that landed near the nuclear site as a surface-to-air missile, which is usually used for air defense against warplanes or other missiles. That could suggest the Syrian missile had targeted Israeli warplanes but missed and flew off errantly. However, Dimona, the Negev desert town where Israel's nuclear reactor is located, is some 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Damascus, a long range for an errantly fired surface-to-air missile.\n\nThe Israeli army said it had deployed a missile defense system to intercept the projectile and that there had been no damage. The Israeli military later said in a statement that an initial investigation indicated that the Syrian missile was not intercepted.\n\nThe air raid sirens were sounded in Abu Krinat, a village just a few kilometers (miles) from Dimona. Explosions heard across Israel might have been the air-defense systems.\n\nApparent missile fragments were found in a swimming pool in Ashalim, a community approximately 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Dimona. Israeli troops arrived at the scene and collected the fragments.\n\nThe military said that in response to the incoming missile, it launched an air strike at the battery that launched the anti-aircraft missile and other surface-to-air batteries in Syria.\n\nThe exchange between Israel and Syria comes against the backdrop of growing tensions between Israel and Iran, a key ally of Syria. Iran, which maintains troops and proxies in Syria, has accused Israel of a series of attacks on its nuclear facilities, including sabotage at its Natanz nuclear facility on April 11, and vowed revenge. It also threatened to complicate U.S.-led attempts to revive the international nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n"},

That has public health officials worried the worst of the pandemic still may be yet to come.\"I cannot stop working,\" said Mostafa Shahni, a worried 34-year-old construction worker in Tehran. \"If I do, I can't bring home bread for my wife and two kids.\"Iran is now reporting its highest-ever new coronavirus case numbers - more than 25,000 a day. Its daily death toll has surged to around 400, still below the grim record of 486 it reached in November.During the peak of Iran's last surge, around 20,000 coronavirus patients were hospitalized across the country. Today, that figure has topped 40,000. The health ministry warns the number will climb to 60,000 in the coming weeks. Iran remains among the hardest-hit countries in the world and the worst-hit in the Middle East.Across Tehran, Associated Press journalists have seen signs of the pandemic's toll.At Tehran's Shohadaye Tajrish Hospital, orderlies pushed the bodies of two victims of the coronavirus across a parking lot to its morgue, one wrapped in white, the other in a black body bag. All of its wards on five floors of the hospital are reserved for coronavirus patients. One empty gurney held a bouquet of roses left for a recently deceased man. A heart-shaped balloon hovered over a still respirator.At the massive Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, already reeling from the pandemic, workers laid cinder-block rows of new graves. Mourners in black wept at a stream of funerals. Officials plan to open a new morgue at the site to handle the wave of death, much wrought by what Iranians simply call \"corona.\"Saeed Khal, the director of Tehran's main cemetery, said workers buried 350 bodies there on Tuesday alone - at least 150 had died of coronavirus. The cemetery had never processed that many burials in a single day, not even during Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s that saw 1 million people killed.It was \"one of the hardest and saddest days for my colleagues in the half-century-history of the cemetery,\" Khal told state TV.So much is the influx that some burials are being delayed by a day, unusual for Iran which follows the Islamic practice of immediately burying the dead.Outside the gates of Tehran's Imam Khomeini Hospital complex, where the capital's poor can receive free treatment at its 1,300 beds, scores crowded around one recent day as guards turned away routine cases and allowed in only test-confirmed coronavirus cases.\"They say the wards are full of corona patients,\" said Manijeh Taheri, who sought a regular thyroid treatment for her mother at the hospital. \"I have no idea where to take her when such a huge complex has no place for my mother.\"Field hospitals are being prepared in Tehran and other major cities. State TV has shown images at hospitals outside the capital with patients being treated in hallways.\"We are not going out of the red zone any time soon,\" Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi told state media.President Hassan Rouhani blames the current surge on the fast-spreading variant of the virus first found in Britain, which the government says arrived from neighboring Iraq. Travel between the countries has been restricted since March, though people and commerce continue to cross each day. Overall, Iran has seen 2.2 million reported cases and 67,000 deaths in total.Lawmaker Jalil Rahimi Jahanabadi blamed government mismanagement and continued US sanctions for the virus' spread.\"Sanctions, challenges and wrong decisions will continue. We do not have sufficient vaccines so protect yourself and your relatives through personal health measures,\" he wrote on Twitter.As of now, Iran has administered over 500,000 vaccine doses, according to the WHO. Supplies, however, remain limited. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has banned US and British-made coronavirus vaccines, saying their import is \"forbidden\" because he does not trust those nations. Khamenei has approved the import of vaccines from \"safe\" countries, such as China and Russia, and has backed national efforts to produce a homegrown vaccine with help from Cuba.But officials keep changing when they say the wider public will be vaccinated as it remains unclear when Tehran will have a promised 60 million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine.Amir Afkhami, an associate professor at George Washington University, said that over the past year, Iran's leadership could point to superpowers like the U.S. struggling to contain the virus. With vaccines rolled out in the West and economies reopening, this could become much more difficult to do, he said.\"Ultimately Iran is not self-sufficient when it comes to Covid-19 vaccine development, and it doesn't have the (intensive care unit) beds to absorb the patients it needs to so it really needs external help,\" Afkhami said.Authorities across Iran have closed mosques, restaurants and parks during Ramadan, the Islamic holy fasting month being observed by Muslims around the world. An evening curfew for private cars is in place and travel between cities is banned. Parliament has been suspended for two weeks.But the wider fatigue from the virus has seen people ignore warnings and host fast-breaking meals known as iftars indoors. Already, authorities blamed celebrations around the Iranian New Year known as Nowruz in March for contributing to this wave.Masoud Mardani, an infectious disease specialist on Iran's Covid-19 national task force, has demanded a public curfew. But none so far has come."},

The AstraZeneca vaccines will be part of a campaign aiming to vaccinate 20% of the country's population before the end of the year.Syria's government controls two-thirds of the country, with the rest held by rebels and Kurdish factions. Millions have fled the country or been displaced, and the war has killed some half a million people from the pre-war population of 23 million.Health Minister Hassan Ghabbash made the announcement during a news conference held in the capital Damascus. He said the vaccine will be given first to frontline workers, the elderly and those with chronic diseases.Akjemal Magtymova, the representative of the World Health Organization in Syria, said that the government drafted a plan with the WHO and UN children's agency UNICEF to distribute the vaccine equally across the country.Thursday's announcement came a day after Syria's last rebel-held enclave received its first batch of 53,800 Covid-19 vaccines, brought in from neighboring Turkey.The 203,000 jabs that arrived in Damascus will cover government-held areas and those under the control of Kurdish fighters in the northeast. Hundreds of thousands more are scheduled to arrive in the coming months.\"The priority for immunization will be frontline health workers who are the first line of defense against COVID ,\" said Ted Chaiban, regional director for the Middle East and north Africa at UNICEF. Speaking with The Associated Press from neighboring Jordan, Chaiban added that after health workers, older people will be vaccinated.The Syrian government has registered over 21,500 cases - including 1,483 deaths - in areas under its control since the first case was reported in March 2020. Over 21,000 infections and over 640 deaths have been recorded in rebel-held northwestern Syria, while the Kurdish areas in the northeast registered 14,400 cases including 477 deaths.Officials in government-controlled areas had already rolled out limited vaccinations following an announcement by Damascus in February that it received an undetermined amount of vaccine from an unnamed friendly country.Separately, the United Arab Emirates said it sent a shipment of Covid-19 vaccine doses that arrived Tuesday in Damascus to help Syria fight the pandemic. It didn't say how many doses or which vaccine.The WHO had said the vaccination campaign in Syria was expected to start in April. It aims to inoculate 20% of the population by the end of 2021."},

Read More\n\nJAKARTA: Indonesia's navy ships are intensely searching the waters where one of its submarines was last detected before it disappeared with 53 people on board, as neighboring countries are set to join the complex operation.\n\nThe KRI Nanggala 402 was participating in a training exercise Wednesday when it missed a scheduled reporting call. Officials reported an oil slick and the smell of diesel fuel near the starting position of its last dive, about 96 kilometers (60 miles) north of the resort island of Bali .\n\nIndonesia's military said that five navy ships and a helicopter were taking part in the search while a hydro-oceanographic survey ship equipped with underwater detection capabilities is on its way to the site around the oil spills. Officials said they had not yet been linked to the missing submarine.\n\nRescue ships from Singapore and Malaysia are expected to arrive Saturday. The military said Australia, the United States , Germany, France, Australia, Russia, India and Turkey have also offered assistance.\n\nSome worry that the area may be too deep to locate or retrieve the ship, suggesting potential challenges facing the search operation.\n\n\"There looks like a terrible tragedy and it's in a very deep part of waters, 700 or 800 meters (2,297 feet or 2,625 feet) deep potentially,\" Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton told Sydney Radio 2GB .\n\n\"It makes it very difficult for the recovery or for location. But there's some assistance that potentially we can apply and the Chief of the Defense Force (Angus Campbell) obviously reached out to his counterpart to say whatever Australia can provide, we will,\" he said.\n\nThe submarine was carrying 49 crew members, its commander and three gunners, the Indonesian Defense Ministry said.\n\nThe navy said an electrical failure may have occurred during the dive, causing the submarine to lose control and become unable to undertake emergency procedures that would have allowed it to resurface. It said it believes the submarine sank to a depth of 600-700 meters (2,000-2,300 feet).\n\nThe German-built submarine, which has been in service in Indonesia since 1981, was rehearsing for a missile-firing exercise that was to take place on Thursday. Military chief Hadi Tjahjanto and other military leaders were to attend.\n\nIndonesia currently has a fleet of five submarines and plans to operate at least eight by 2024.\n\nThe world's largest archipelago nation with more than 17,000 islands has faced growing challenges to its maritime claims in recent years, including numerous incidents involving Chinese vessels near the Natuna islands.\n\nLast year, president Joko widodo reaffirmed the country's sovereignty during a visit to the islands at the edge of the South China Sea , one of the busiest sea lanes where China is embroiled in territorial disputes with its smaller neighbors.\n\nHis visit came a week after Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang insisted that Chinese fishermen are free to conduct activities in areas China claims as its traditional fishing grounds, which partly overlap Indonesia's exclusive economic zone.\n\nGeng's statement drew indignation in Indonesia and prompted the military to increase its forces at the islands. Although China has been making such claims for years, recently dozens of Chinese fishing boats, escorted by coast guard vessels, have reportedly made more aggressive moves in the area and ignored Indonesian warnings to leave.\n\n"},

(AP)\n\nCANBERRA: Australia has cancelled two Chinese \"Belt and Road'' infrastructure building initiative deals with a state government, provoking an angry response from Beijing.\n\nThe bilateral deals with Victoria state were among four vetoed under new laws that give the federal government power to overrule international agreements by lower-level administrations that violate the national interest, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said late Wednesday.\n\nThe \"Belt and Road'' deals struck with Beijing in 2018 and 2019 triggered the legislative response.\n\nVictoria Education Department pacts signed with Syria in 1999 and Iran in 2004 were also canceled.\n\n\"I consider these four arrangements to be inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adverse to our foreign relations,'' Payne said.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Australia said in a statement the decision \"further shows that the Australian government has no sincerity in improving China-Australia relations.''\n\n\"It is bound to bring further damage to bilateral relations, and will only end up hurting itself,'' the embassy said on Thursday, referring to the Australian government.\n\nThe Global Times , a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party , said in a headline: \"Australia faces serious consequences for unreasonable provocation against China.''\n\nThe move \"marks a significant escalation that could push icy bilateral relations into an abyss,'' the newspaper added.\n\nAustralia's bilateral relations with its most important trading partner are at their lowest point in decades. Chinese government ministers refuse to take phone calls from their Australian counterparts, and trade disruptions are widely seen as China imposing economic punishment.\n\nBut Payne said Thursday she did not expect China to retaliate.\n\n\"Australia is operating in our national interests. We are very careful and very considered in that approach.'' Payne said.\n\n\"It's about ensuring that we have a consistent approach to foreign policy across all levels of government, and it isn't about any one country,'' she said. \"It is most certainly not intended to harm Australia's relationships with any countries.''\n\nVictoria's center-left Labor Party government said the Foreign Relations Act, under which the deals were cancelled, was a matter for the federal government.\n\n\"The Victorian government will continue to work hard to deliver jobs, trade and economic opportunities for our state,'' the statement said.\n\nVictoria's opposition leader Michael O'Brien, who vowed to scrap the deals if he won elections next year, welcomed the federal government's decision.\n\nO'Brien, who belongs to the same conservative Liberal Party as the foreign minister, said the Victorian government had \"given away major infrastructure contracts to Chinese-owned companies'' under one deal.\n\n\"In return, the Chinese government has smashed our farmers with tariffs on barley. They have smashed our wine exporters with trade sanctions,'' O'Brien told Melbourne Radio 3AW.\n\nObservers have described the Victorian deals as vague and non-binding. Some suspect their value to the Chinese Communist Party was to exploit differences in opinion in Australia over \"Belt and Road'' deals, which critics argue can create debt traps for poor countries.\n\nAustralian Defense Minister Peter Dutton said his government would not allow the Chinese Communist Party to use such deals with Australian states as \"propaganda.''\n\n\"Our problem is with the values or the virtues or the outlook of the Chinese Communist Party ,'' Dutton told Sydney Radio 2GB.\n\nThe party had militarized ports in the Asia-Pacific region and Australian security agencies had reported an increased level of foreign interference across the region, Dutton said.\n\n\"We're worried about cyberattacks and we're worried obviously about state governments that enter into compacts with the Communist Party against our national interests,'' Dutton said.\n\n\"We can't allow these sort of compacts, these sort of arrangements and friendships to pop up because they're used for propaganda reasons and we're just not going to allow that to happen,'' he added.\n\n"},

Read More\n\nMOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday sternly warned the West against encroaching further on Russia's security interests, saying Moscow's response will be ``quick and tough'' and make the culprits bitterly sorry for their action.\n\nThe warning during Putin's annual state-of-the-nation address came amid a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine, where cease-fire violations in the seven-year conflict between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have escalated in recent weeks. The United States and its allies have urged the Kremlin to pull the troops back.\n\n``I hope that no one dares to cross the red line in respect to Russia, and we will determine where it is in each specific case,'' Putin said. ``Those who organize any provocations threatening our core security interests will regret their deeds more than they regretted anything for a long time.''\n\nMoscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the troop buildup, saying it doesn't threaten anyone and that Russia is free to deploy its forces on its territory. But the Kremlin also has warned Ukraine against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel-held east, saying Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region.\n\n``We really don't want to burn the bridges,'' Putin said. ``But if some mistake our good intentions for indifference or weakness and intend to burn or even blow up those bridges themselves, Russia's response will be asymmetrical, quick and tough.''\n\nAs Putin spoke, a wave of protests started rolling across Russia in support of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny , and a human rights group said over 1,000 people were arrested. Thousands marched in central Moscow, where police blocked off a square next to the Kremlin. Police in St. Petersburg blocked off Palace Square, outside the Hermitage museum, and protesters instead massed along Nevsky Prospekt.\n\nThe politician, who is Putin's most persistent critic and was poisoned with a chemical nerve agent last year, started a hunger strike three weeks ago to protest what he said was inadequate medical treatment and officials' refusal to allow his doctor to visit him. His supporters called the rallies as his health reportedly is in severe decline.\n\nIn his speech, Putin pointed to Russia's moves to modernize its nuclear arsenal and said the military would continue to build more state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles and other new weapons. He added that the development of the nuclear-armed Poseidon underwater drone and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile is continuing successfully.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the US and its allies, the Russian leader denounced those who impose ``unlawful, politically motivated economic sanctions and crude attempts to enforce its will on others.'' He said Russia has shown restraint and often refrained from responding to ``openly boorish'' actions by others.\n\nThe Biden administration last week imposed new sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2020 US presidential election and for involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies _ activities Moscow has denied. The US ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and individuals, and imposed new curbs on Russia's ability to borrow money.\n\nRussia retaliated by ordering 10 US diplomats to leave, blacklisting eight current and former US officials, and tightening requirements for US Embassy operations.\n\n``Russia has its own interests, which we will defend in line with the international law,'' Putin said during Wednesday's address. ``If somebody refuses to understand this obvious thing, is reluctant to conduct a dialogue and chooses a selfish and arrogant tone, Russia will always find a way to defend its position.''\n\nIn an emotional outburst, Putin chastised the West for acquiring a defiant stance toward Russia.\n\n``Some countries have developed a nasty habit of bullying Russia for any reason or without any reason at all. It has become a new sport,'' he said.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the US allies, he compared them to Tabaqui, a cowardly golden jackal kowtowing to Shere Khan, the tiger in Rudyard Kipling's ``Jungle Book.'' ``They howl to please their lord,'' he said.\n\nRussia this week engaged in a tense tug-of-war with the Czech Republic, following Prague's move to expel 18 Russian diplomats over a massive Czech ammunition depot explosion in 2014. Moscow has dismissed the Czech accusations of its involvement in the blast as absurd and retaliated by expelling 20 Czech diplomats.\n\nPutin also harshly criticized the West for failing to condemn what he described as a botched coup attempt and a failed plot to assassinate Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko , allegedly involving a blockade of the country's capital, power cuts and cyberattacks. Belarusian and Russian security agencies arrested the alleged coup plotters in Moscow earlier this month.\n\n``The practice of organizing coups and planning political assassinations of top officials goes over the top and crosses all boundaries,'' Putin said, drawing parallels to plots against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the popular protests that led to the ouster of Ukraine's former Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014.\n\nRussia responded to Yanukovych's ouster by annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and throwing its support to the separatists in the country's east. Since then, fighting there has killed more than 14,000 people and devastated the industrial heartland.\n\nPutin dedicated most of his annual address to domestic issues, hailing the nation's response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the quick development of three coronavirus vaccines underlined Russia's technological and industrial potential. He called for a quicker pace of immunizations, voicing hope the country could achieve collective immunity this fall.\n\nHe put forward incentives to help the economy recover from the pandemic and promised new social payments focusing on families with children.\n\n"},

How difficult are such selection decisions?\n\n(Veteran striker SV Sunil was ignored for the tour of Argentina - TOI Photo)\n\nDoes Tokyo weather call for selection of younger players, who can last longer in humid conditions while playing, for example, five games in 7-8 days?\n\n(Reid was named coach of the Indian team after the sacking of Harendra Singh following the 2018 World Cup - HI Photo)\n\nDo you consider postponement of the game vs Great Britain a setback or did you anticipate that considering the Covid graph?\n\nCovid has ruled the Indian team off-side once again. The rule was abolished by 1992, but a virus is still playing by it -- halting teams right when they seem to be building up pace.India set off on the road after a year and in their first two official internationals, the team got the better of Olympic champions Argentina . But the day they returned home from South America, the virus struck again.India's next away fixture of the Pro League , which was scheduled for May 8 and 9 against Great Britain in London, has been postponed. With the virus mutating and spreading like wildfire in India, the government of the United Kingdom has put India on its 'red list'. Hence, the team can't travel.While that's the unfortunate bit, it doesn't take the shine off of what the Indian team achieved in Buenos Aires.The visitors showed some steel to come back and level the first game at 2-2, before claiming the bonus point in a shootout. The second game saw India dominating the hosts. A 3-0 win was the kind of scoreline coach Graham Reid was looking for.Of the six matches in the Argentine capital, India lost just one, which left Reid chuffed about the outcome.In an interview with Timesofindia.com at the conclusion of the tour, the Australian shared his notes, while keeping Covid central to what lies ahead on the road.We were very happy with the results. Of course, we lost that fifth game. Sometimes you need those wake-up calls every now and then for the players to understand that they have to bring out their best every time. Sometimes as a coach you sort of think, 'Okay, you need those things as medicines.'We need to be a little more frugal in defence. That's still valid. It's always (a) work in progress. As we play against [top] teams, they will try and do things differently to try and beat us. So we have to constantly change our structure a little bit.That's the great thing about competition -- the ability to keep plugging the hole. So when a team [opposition] does that, this is what we do. So if you have experienced it before, you end up with better planning at the end of it.The other thing, of course, is we are trying to make sure we make the most of all the opportunities and try and convert those opportunities into better ones. We had a good number of circle penetrations, but we would like to create more quality opportunities. That's what we will be spending a bit of time on between now and Europe [Pro League tours]. We are working on that.One of things that we worked on was our ability to maintain (a) sustained attack -- what I have been trying to develop with the guys. If the gap is not there at the moment, we [should] move the ball, go to the other side, check. It gives you a bit more control.What we are chasing, of course, is more quality attack based on that. Those things take a while. You train for something and then you see it starting to come [happen] in a game until a little later on. We need to keep working on that, getting them [players] to understand when it's better to just hold the ball, wait for the right opportunity. Having said that, I still like to attack (laughs). So there has to be the right balance.I prefer not to talk about selection in public, to be honest. All I can probably say is it's going to be a really tough selection [for upcoming tours]. Every time you are selecting from this [core] group, it's hard because the quality is there.What I am really trying to do is develop the breadth of the squad, which means when it comes to picking a team, you have the best players available...options. Covid is still a real concern, so you perhaps need even a broader base than you need in a normal campaign, so that you have got quality players who can come in at any point in time.That's what we are trying to do, provide opportunities and also provide as much competition in the squad so that we are pushing ourselves to be better and better.Tokyo will be a tough environment, when we have back-to-back games. That's the good thing about [Pro League tours of] Europe. We will get opportunities to play consecutive games. Historically at the Olympics, there's been a nice gap between games but this time there are going to be back-to-back games. So it's an important skill to have for players to be able to maintain the high tempo of the game.It's good to have players who give you experience but also some youth to bring in the enthusiasm and the extra energy. That's again a constant balance that you try to achieve as a coach.I've said this before, that with the changing scenario world-over due to Covid, we have to take each day as it comes. That is why I always tell the team to not worry about things that are not in our control.For now, our focus is to utilise the facilities in SAI Centre Bengaluru to make the necessary changes to our game based on the Argentina tour analysis and continue as per [Pro League] schedule in Spain and Germany."},

Luckily, we also have a strong technical partner in PETRONAS that will push me to deliver strong finishes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the motor racing legend told TOI.\n\nRossi --- competing for the MotoGP crown with riders much younger to him --- looks for inspiration from icons in other sporting disciplines who have delivered strong shows despite either nearing or in their 40s.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy number 1 inspiration is Roger Federer. I adore his game and the way he carries himself. Federer continues to compete even at this age and will cheer for him to win that Wimbledon crown again. There are others such as Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u00c4\u0087 and Tom Brady who inspire me as well, but Federer is the one who tops the list,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rossi, who is into his 26th year as a professional rider.\n\nRossi knows that he is nearer to the finish line in his career than ever but still wants to give it a shot this season and probably in 2022 before hanging up his boots.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my mind, I feel I can race this year and in 2022.

He definitely has the potential,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Morbidelli, who had finished second in the MotoGP rankings last year.\n\nMorbidelli believes it is tough to replicate his 2020 season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance this year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more difficult than last year because we have the same package (in our bike) while the other riders have improved ones.

He always remained rooted and identified with his roots, no matter where he travelled and what work he did. Whether he was doing an international or an Indian film, commercial mainstream or independent film or any other, he was intensely rooted to the person he was. That is the most special and endearing thing about him that everyone will remember him for.I was tremendously in awe of him. I got the opportunity to work with him at a time when my career was not flying high and he was an extremely celebrated actor, well known for his craft. For him to put his trust in me as a director and agree to do my film will be the most cherished moments of my life and career. Talvar was a rebirth for me as a filmmaker, and Irrfan sir being in the film was a big part of that. Apart from that, when we collaborated on Talvar, the relationship we shared was precious, it was extremely professional. It was a tricky subject. Not just as an actor, but even while discussing the case, he would throw questions at me, making me constantly question the knowledge I had and not get complacent at any given point \u2013 even though the script was locked and we were shooting. The way his mind worked, and therefore forced my mind to work and to question the alternative, was a precious learning experience for me.I can\u2019t say consciously which part of his personality rubbed off. Unfortunately, our conversations and our equation was limited to working on the film. There was no off-the-set equation with him, not because of anything else, but the sheer regard and awe I felt. I could never think I could have a friendly dinner or a heart-to-heart with him. What has stayed back with me is his questioning mind which I hope I can emulate when the time comes.I met Irrfan sir on and off on my father\u2019s ( Gulzar ) set when he was playing a part in an episode of Kirdaar. I met him in Vishal (Bhardwaj) sir\u2019s office intermittently. But the first one-on-one conversation I had with him was when I met him at his home for the first time after we had given him the script of Talvar. We spoke about the case; he asked me for my perspective and I asked him for his. It\u2019s ironic that he went through the film, played the CBI investigator and till date, I don\u2019t know what his stand on the narrative, the case is. I know he was proud of the work we had done and the product we had put out, but what was going on in his mind is still a mystery to me. And there was so much going on inside but it all looked simple when he executed it on screen. That is where the unassuming part comes into play. There was so much nuance and understudy that went into every role and when he performed, you could not say he was acting. The performance was natural, so much so that it made you believe this is how he laughs, gets angry or cries. That\u2019s the facet of him being unassuming as a person but there was serious hard work that went behind the small gestures, the twitches, the casual one-liners or repartees. It never came off the cuff. It all looked effortless and natural when it came out and one could never call it a performance. But it took a lot of research, deep thinking for him. That is what is special about him."},
