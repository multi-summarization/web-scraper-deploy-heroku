During this period, cases have surged at 6.76% daily, more than four times faster than a similar growth in daily numbers in the US \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the only other country that has recorded more than 1 lakh cases in a day.After the first peak in September, cases dipped for 30 straight weeks before they started rising again in mid-February.Experts and authorities believe that the overwhelming surge happened because people let their guard down and were lulled into believing that the worst of the pandemic was behind them.They add that India also failed to seize the opportunity to augment its healthcare infrastructure and vaccinate aggressively.\"We were so close to success,\" Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan who has been tracking India's pandemic, told AP.Virologist Shahid Jameel said that people let their guard down too early and opened up.\"We really didn't prepare in the time we got. As a result, the healthcare system is severely short-staffed right now ... the infrastructure is crumbling.\"Nikolai Petrovsky, a professor at an Australian university, said that people started to think they have escaped the pandemic, especially when it didn't hit the country as hard as everyone was expecting during the first wave.\"Now, of course, we are seeing a much more significant problem emerging, and you know, it could prove disastrous. You can't even vaccinate 1.2 billion overnight, it's just not possible even with all the best resources,\" he said.Professor Rijo M John from the Kerala-based Rajagiri College of social sciences said that the political leaders also share the blame due to their \"irresponsible statements\".\"Once the cases from the first wave began dropping and reached a low, there had been an overwhelming feeling among the general public that the worst was behind and they were out of danger. It was partly fuelled by irresponsible statements from several political leaders, many from the ruling government itself, leading people to inadvertently believe that India had defeated Covid. Perhaps, this may have lead them to engage in laxer behaviour,\" he said.Critics have also pointed to the government deciding not to pause religious festivals or elections despite the initial spike in infections, which may have exacerbated the surge.\"Authorities across India, without exception, put public health priorities on the back burner,\" said K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India.Meanwhile, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan refused to speculate why authorities could have been better prepared, saying: \"Today is not the time to go into why did we miss, or did we miss, did we prepare?\"Some experts said it is likely that the surge could be fueled by the presence of more infectious variants, which weren't there during the first wave.Late last year, scientists had detected a new variant, called B.1.617, with two mutations - the E484Q and L452R. This double mutant strain was first detected in Maharashtra.\"We cannot rule out the role of more infectious variants (homegrown and known imported variants) in different parts of the country. In most samples in Punjab, the UK variant is isolated, while the available evidence indicates the 'double mutant' strain is mostly prevalent in the state of Maharashtra. While it is known that the UK variant is more contagious, evidence regarding the Indian strain is yet to emerge,\" professor Giridhar Babu of Public Health Foundation of India said.Now, India has also detected a \"triple mutated\" variant of the virus, which has been found in samples collected from Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh.In fact, the Covid-19 virus that is doing the rounds in Bengal is increasingly being found to be an indigenous triple-mutation (B.1.618).\u00e2\u0080\u009cBengal strain\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as a scientist has dubbed it, might be more infective, and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something that experts find particularly worrying \u00e2\u0080\u0094 may be capable of escaping a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immune surveillance, even if that person was earlier exposed to a virus without this mutation, and even if vaccinated.There has, however, been no research yet to either corroborate or dismiss the fears over the new variants.It's hard to say but experts believe that India will hit its peak between May 11-15.Scientists working on a mathematical model to work out the course of the pandemic say there is a possibility of a peak between May 11-15 with 33-35 lakh total \u00e2\u0080\u0098active\u00e2\u0080\u0099 infections.This means the number of \u00e2\u0080\u0098active\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cases in India will keep increasing roughly for another three weeks before a decline.If the current model shows the trend correctly, the mid-May peak would be three time higher than the first peak of over 10 lakh \u00e2\u0080\u0098active\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cases witnessed on September 17 last year.The current model shows that Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Telangana may see a peak of 'new' cases during April 25-30; Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal during May 1-5 while Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh during May 6-10. It shows Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh might already have reached its peak phase now while Bihar will see it around April 25.India is faced with the massive challenge of trying to prevent its health care system from further collapse until enough people can be vaccinated to significantly reduce the flow of patients.The flood of new infections has already overwhelmed the healthcare system, with various hospitals as well as states reporting shortage of oxygen, ICU beds, ventilators and key drugs.The good news is that India is a major vaccine producer, but even after halting large exports of vaccines in March to divert them to domestic use, there are still questions of whether manufactures can produce enough fast enough.\"Vaccination is one way to slow down the spread - but this really depends on the speed and availability of the shots,\" said Reddy of the Public Health Foundation.India has so far administered jabs to over 13.23 crore of its population, which includes over 1.9 crore people who have been fully vaccinated."},

This will mean that hospitals will need to use the available resources better till more supplies come in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 a challenge given the rising burden of infections and higher number of patients needing breathing support.Earlier this week, the government had decided to limit supplies only to a handful of industries including pharma , nuclear power plants, steel units and oil refineries.Following the rise in cases across several states, the allocation formula has been tweaked with Maharashtra , which has the highest number of cases for several weeks now, getting the highest allocation of 1,425 metric tonnes a day, a 37% jump over the earlier level. The highest increase has been made in the case of Kerala , with Delhi too seeing a 67% jump."},

We will hear it (plea of Vedanta) tomorrow,\" the bench said in the hearing conducted through video conferencing.\"The country is in dire need of oxygen and the Centre is augmenting oxygen from whichever source. Vedanta wants to make its plant operational, but let Vedanta only make it operational to manufacture oxygen for health purposes,\" solicitor general Tushar Mehta said.The Delhi high court on Thursday observed that the Covid-19 situation in the national capital has turned \u00e2\u0080\u009cprecarious\u00e2\u0080\u009d with many hospitals running out of oxygen and directed the Centre to ensure the gas is supplied to the city as per the planned allocation and without any hindrances.\"We all know that this country is being run by god,\" observed an anguish bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli which was of the view that all measures should be taken for removing obstructions in the transportation of oxygen.If the government wants it can do anything and can even make \u00e2\u0080\u009cheaven meet earth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it said.On Wednesday, the court had rebuked Centre over the oxygen crisis in Delhi and other cities, asking it to \"beg, borrow or steal\" to ensure that oxygen reaches hospitals.Several small hospitals in the city struggled to replenish oxygen supply for coronavirus patients on Thursday morning, even as some big healthcare facilities received fresh stock overnight.The Haryana government on Thursday allotted 140 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen produced in Panipat to the national capital.The move came after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sought help from his Haryana counterpartManohar Lal Khattar to facilitate the transport of oxygen trucks from Haryana to Delhi.\"I spoke to CM of Haryana Manohar Lal Khattar. Sought his support in facilitating the transport of oxygen trucks from Haryana to Delhi. He has assured full support,\" Kejriwal said in a tweet earlier in the day.Separately, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, alleging that tankers carrying oxygen were not able to reach hospitals in the national capital as they were being stalled by police and officials in UP and Haryana.With oxygen shortage gripping the national capital, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday asked the Delhi Police to create \"green corridor\" for all oxygen tankers from point of entry to designated destination.\"To monitor movement of oxygen tankers, Delhi Police will keep record of entry, exit of such vehicles through various checkpoints,\" it said.It has also set up a 24x7 control room to redress grievances and complaints from city hospitals regarding shortage within 30 minutes.Two senior IAS officers have also been appointed to ensure smooth movement of tankers and seamless supply to health establishments in DelhiIn an order, the DDMA has also directed all Delhi hospitals to form \"audit committees\" to supervise and rationalise the use of medical oxygen.The second wave of the Covid pandemic has seen an increased demand for oxygen as a significant number of people are suffering from Covid-induced respiratory complications.This has led to panic and people are trying to keep oxygen cylinders handy.As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director-general, Dr Balram Bhargava, the oxygen requirement in the second wave of Covid-19 stood at 54.5 per cent as compared to 41.5 per cent in the first wave.Bhargava also said that while the demand for oxygen has increased proportionately in the second wave, the demand for ventilator has not been high.However, experts have cautioned against the waste of oxygen by those who are taking it intermittently to boost their oxygen levels out of fear.According to AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria, healthy individuals with oxygen saturation in the range of 93-94 per cent do not need to take high-flow oxygen just to maintain their saturation at 98-99 per cent.\"Oxygen is a treatment, it is like a drug,\" Guleria said to drive home the point that taking it intermittently is an absolute waste of oxygen.\"There is no data that shows that intermittent use of oxygen will be of any help to the patients and is, therefore, ill-advised,\" he added.Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman, Medanta Hospital, has urged people not to use oxygen as a \"security blanket\".According to Dr Devi Shetty, chairman, Narayana Health, oxygen saturation of above 94 per cent is not a problem and a doctor may be consulted if it dips after exercise or effortful work."},

Royals, with a team that hardly inspires confidence, are again looking good for bringing up the rear.The sixes that came off Padikkal's blade was more about timing than power as he hit 11 fours and six sixes during his knock.Picking the length of Mustafizur Rahaman's short ball and getting into the shape to execute a perfect pull-shot for a six showed why experts feel that it's only a matter of time before he dons national colours.The inside out chip off Riyan Parag over extra cover to complete his half-century off 27 balls, the sweep shots, the slash over backward point and the straight sixes with economy of footwork, were all testimony to his solid technical foundation.Once Padikkal was in his mid 80's, the RCB skipper chanced his arms including a six over extra cover off Royals' costliest buy Chris Morris.Kohli's 50 came off 34 balls and was followed by a personal milestone of 6000 runs in IPL as Royals surrendered way before the match officially ended.Earlier, Rahul Tewatia's impressive death overs hitting ensured a fighting 177 for 9 for Rajasthan Royals after yet another familiar top order no-show.On a good batting surface, Royals managed a total which may be 25 runs short but credit for the decent score goes to a counter-attacking effort from all-rounder Shivam Dube (46 off 32 balls) which stemmed the rot and big-hits from Tewatia (40 off 23 balls) that helped them get past 175-run mark.Dube smashed two sixes and five fours and with Riyan Parag (25 off 16 balls) giving him good support, added 66 runs for the fifth wicket off only 6.2 overs to give his team's total some semblance of respectability.While the giant all-rounder was comfortable playing at \"home\", using the pace of deliveries, the profligate top-order of Royals once again flattered to deceive along with their skipper Sanju Samson , who has been \"consistently inconsistent\".It took Dube's impressive effort to lend some muscle to the Royals' rickety-looking scorecard.For RCB, Mohammed Siraj's (3/27 in 4 overs) off-cutter first-up cleaned Jos Buttler (8) and Manan Vohra (7) , with another atrocious shot selection off Kyle Jamieson (1/28 in 4 overs), might have ensured a lengthy spell for himself in the dug-out.Siraj then unleashed a perfect toe-crusher for David Miller (0) as skipper Virat Kohli made a perfect call for DRS.Samson (21 off 18 balls), maintained his near decade-long IPL tradition of fizzling out after one or two good knocks as a six off Washington Sundar was followed by an indiscreet chip shot at mid-wicket.Dube's two sixes in one over from Yuzvendra Chahal (0/18 in 2 overs) over long-on forced Kohli to take his leg-spinner out of attack.Kane Richardson (1/29 in 3 overs) then denied Dube on what would have been a good half-century as Tewatia upped the ante in the final overs along with Chris Morris."},

Etihad regrets any inconvenience caused to its guests by these temporary restrictions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Etihad spokesperson added.Emirates said on its website: \u00e2\u0080\u009cEffective April 24, 2021, and for the next 10 days, Emirates flights from India to the UAE will be suspended. Furthermore, passengers who have transited through India in the last 14 days will not be accepted to travel from any other point to the UAE.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDelhi-Dubai and Mumbai-Dubai are among the international busiest routes even during the pandemic. Both Indian and UAE carriers fly between multiple Indian cities and four in UAE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe expect lot of rush to fly to UAE over Friday and Saturday to reach there before the 11.59 pm on Saturday (April 24) deadline (local time). Only those who have had their Covid test within 48 hours of the flights they wish to take and have a negative report will be able to beat this deadline,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said an airline official.Since private jets and charter flights are allowed, demand to travel from India to UAE on them will increase.While hiring an Airbus A320/Boeing 737 type aircraft costs about Rs 40 lakh (for a Delhi-UAE-Delhi flights), smaller business jets cost about Rs 8-10 lakh less, said industry honchos.Charter firm JetSetGo chief executive and founder Kanika Tekriwal said she had received about 100 queries for flying to UAE within three hours of the ban announcement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are hardly any tickets available (on commercial flights before the deadline),\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.AI Express said people booked with it \u00e2\u0080\u009cto fly during this period will be able to reschedule their tickets once flight operations on these sectors resume.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cargo flights will continue to operate in both directions without any impact, says Etihad.UAE \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the biggest international destination for Indians \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is the second country after UK to bar the entry of Indians due to the highly infectious new Covid strain here that has led to an explosive rise in number of cases.Before the 10-day ban, Dubai had tightened entry norms for Indians. Travellers going from India to Dubai from Thursday (April 22) require a negative Covid report from a test done within 48 hours \u00e2\u0080\u0094 reduced from 72 hours currently \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of their departure to the UAE.From 8.30 am (IST) on Friday, Indian citizens will not be allowed to enter United Kingdom as UK has added India to its red list of countries \u00e2\u0080\u0094 signifying high Covid risk."},

(PTI)\n\nKOLKATA: The Covid-19 virus that is doing the rounds in Bengal is increasingly being found to be an indigenous triple-mutation (B.1.618), only the second one identified from India after the double mutant type (B.1.617) reported last month.\n\nThe \u00e2\u0080\u009cBengal strain\u00e2\u0080\u009d, as a scientist has dubbed it, might be more infective, and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 something that experts find particularly worrying \u00e2\u0080\u0094 may be capable of escaping a person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s immune surveillance, even if that person was earlier exposed to a virus without this mutation, and even if vaccinated. There has, however, been no research yet to either corroborate or dismiss the fears.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe proportion of B.1.618 has been growing significantly in recent months in Bengal,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vinod Scaria, who researches genome mutations at the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB) on Twitter, adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009calong with B.1.617 it forms a major lineage in West Bengal\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe IGIB is part of the Indian SARS-Cov-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG), which was set up to monitor and study whether Indians were getting foreign variants through travellers. It was during these studies that the double mutant variant (containing the E484Q and L452R mutations) were identified, mainly from Maharashtra samples.\n\nThe sequencing of the viral genomes collected from eastern India is carried out by the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG), Kalyani, around 50km from Kolkata. The institute houses one of 10 Indian labs working across the country on sequencing genomes from coronavirus patients.\n\nIt was the NIBMG that first sequenced the Bengal strain from a patient on October 25 last year. By January this year, it was found to have proliferated in fairly large numbers.\n\nData submitted from India to GISAID, a global science initiative and primary source established in 2008 that provides open-access to genomic data of influenza viruses, show B.1.618 is the third-most common variant sequenced in the last 60 days across the country, causing nearly 12% of the cases. The double-mutated B.1.617, at 28%, is the most common among sequences, followed by B.1.1.7 (the UK variant).\n\nWhat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worrying to scientists is that the triple-mutated variant carries the E484K mutation, a characteristic of the South African and Brazilian variants. \u00e2\u0080\u009cE484K is known to be an immune escape variant, which means that previously raised antibodies against a virus without this mutation may be less effective in inhibiting the virus from infecting and causing disease in humans. This includes antibodies raised from vaccines,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said NIBMG associate professor Sreedhar Chinnaswamy.\n\nIn other words, you may not be safe from this variant if you had previously been infected by another strain of the virus, or even if you have been vaccinated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Bengal strain (B.1.618)\u00e2\u0080\u009d, explained Chinnaswamy, \u00e2\u0080\u009chas four signature mutations that are distinct from the so-called \u00e2\u0080\u0098double mutant\u00e2\u0080\u0099 circulating in some parts of India in recent months,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt contains the now fixed D614G mutation, that can be called \u00e2\u0080\u0098the first variant\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to be identified from the virus that supposedly originated from Wuhan, China. It also has the E484K mutation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA member of the team involved in the sequencing of the variant at the Kalyani-based institute, Chinnaswamy said the new variant has \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeletions\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the spike protein. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese deletions are not in the region of the spike protein that contacts the human ACE2 receptor, and we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what significance they may have in the viral infection cycle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nMembers of this Bengal lineage or variant have also been found in the US, Singapore, Switzerland and Finland. The variant was first found in a sample outside India on April 22, 2020.\n\nA majority of the cases in Maharashtra and Gujarat have been found to contain the double (E484Q and L452R) mutant variant, whereas Delhi and Punjab cases are mostly of the UK variant. No such pattern has yet been detected in south India.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is yet another variant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said immunologist Dipyaman Ganguly from CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata. \u00e2\u0080\u009cInterestingly, a lot of variants are coming up with similar mutations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 E484K, also present in P.1 from Brazil, and 1.351 from South Africa \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which is an immune escape variant. Perhaps these help the virus being more successful in infections and thus multiple variants are converging to similar mutations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\nIn Video: Covid-19: Triple-mutant \u00e2\u0080\u0098Bengal strain\u00e2\u0080\u0099 is a new worry in second wave"},

India has been experiencing an unpre... Read More\n\nNEW DELHI: Fitch Ratings on Thursday said the resurgence of Covid-19 infections may delay India's economic recovery, but won't derail it, as it kept the sovereign rating unchanged at 'BBB-' with a negative outlook.\n\nIt projected a 12.8 per cent recovery in GDP in the fiscal year ending March 2022 (FY22), moderating to 5.8 per cent in FY23, from an estimated contraction of 7.5 per cent in 2020-21.\n\nFitch had in June last year revised outlook for India to 'negative' from 'stable' on grounds that the coronavirus pandemic had significantly weakened the country's growth outlook and exposed the challenges associated with a high public debt burden.\n\nIndia enjoyed 'BBB-' rating since the upgrade in August 2006, but the outlook has oscillated between stable and negative.\n\nIn affirming 'BBB-' rating, Fitch on Thursday maintained a negative outlook for the rating, reflecting \"lingering uncertainty around the debt trajectory\".\n\n\"India's rating balances a still strong medium-term growth outlook and external resilience from solid foreign-reserve buffers, against high public debt, a weak financial sector and some lagging structural factors.\n\n\"The negative outlook reflects lingering uncertainty around the debt trajectory following the sharp deterioration in India's public finance metrics due to the pandemic shock from a previous position of limited fiscal headroom,\" it said in a statement.\n\nWider fiscal deficits and the government plans for only a gradual narrowing of the deficit put greater onus on India's ability to return to high levels of GDP growth over the medium term to stabilise and bring down the debt ratio.\n\nFitch said the recent surge in coronavirus cases poses increasing downside risks to the FY22 outlook. \"This second wave of virus cases may delay the recovery, but it is unlikely in Fitch's view to derail it.\"\n\nIn particular, the strong rebound in 2H FY21 and ongoing policy support underpin our expectations for recovery.\n\n\"We expect pandemic-related restrictions to remain localised and less stringent than the national lockdown imposed in 2Q20, and the vaccine rollout has been stepped up,\" it said.\n\nIndia recorded 3,12,731 new infections in 24 hours - the highest daily case count in a single country since the virus surfaced in China more than a year ago.\n\nOver the past two months, the outbreak in India has exploded, with reports of superspreader gatherings, oxygen shortages and medicine shortages.\n\nThe death toll has also climbed to record 2,104.\n\n\"Fiscal metrics have deteriorated sharply in the context of the macroeconomic shock and efforts to support health outcomes and the economic recovery. We estimate a general government deficit of 14 per cent of GDP in FY21 (excluding divestment) from 7.3 per cent in FY20, consistent with a deficit of 9.5 per cent for the central government,\" Fitch said.\n\nPart of the increase in the FY21 deficit (around 1.5 per cent of GDP) reflects increased transparency by bringing off-budget spending on the budget.\n\nThe government is repaying loans to the Food Corporation of India from the National Small Savings Fund and then keeping such subsidy spending on-budget.\n\n\"We expect the general government deficit to narrow to 10.8 per cent of GDP (7.1 per cent central government), on the basis of our expectations of growth recovery and strong revenue performance in 2HFY21,\" it said.\n\nThe central government's FY22 budget outlined a gradual medium-term consolidation, targeting a deficit of 4.5 per cent of GDP by FY26. This compares to a previous medium-term target of 3 per cent of GDP under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.\n\n\"The medium-term debt trajectory is core to our rating assessment, as higher debt levels constrain the government's ability to respond to future shocks and could lead to a crowding out of financing for the private sector, in our view. India's current ability to finance its deficits domestically is a strength relative to most 'BBB' peers,\" it said.\n\nFitch expected India's potential growth to remain robust relative to 'BBB' peers at around 6.5 per cent.\n\n\"The government remains reform-minded, evidenced by the passing of agricultural and labour market reforms in November. These reforms could lift growth if implementation risks are addressed, particularly for the agricultural reforms which have met stiff resistance by farmers.\n\n\"The production-linked incentive scheme to attract FDI and planned increase in public Capex could boost private sector investment,\" it noted.\n\nHowever, weaknesses in India's financial sector pose a risk to the medium-term outlook. \"The degree of asset quality deterioration from the pandemic shock is unclear, amid regulatory forbearance measures and renewed pressures from the second wave.\"\n\nFitch expected inflation to decline to an average of 4.4 per cent in FY22, after hovering above the RBI's 2-6 per cent target band for much of FY21.\n\n\"Price pressures have moderated, even though both headline and core inflation remain near the upper end of the band. We expect the RBI to keep the policy rate stable in the coming year, following 115 bps in cuts since March 2020,\" it added.\n\n"},

We all are aware that this virus strain is spreading at a very fast pace and is infecting people from all age groups. So it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important that we take all the necessary precautions to safeguard our students and even teachers from the virus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dably.A CBSE school teacher told TOI that some students did attend practicals even though they were positive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe come to know these things through their classmates. These kids anyway live their life on social media and so they always share such information either in a small Whatsapp group or during their group video calls to each other. Some of them will write on Instagram about parents becoming positive or a sibling. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nothing private about their lives anymore. So I am not speculating that positive students attended practicals, rather, I know it for a fact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the teacher.But since this information came a few days after the tests, teachers say they were helpless. Another teacher said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been telling our principals to make RT-PCR mandatory for all but they are more focussed on getting the practical exam over and done with. Now, these practical exams have been put on hold and I hope that the school management takes it seriously.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCBSE had earlier advised parents to take an \u00e2\u0080\u009ceducated view\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the issue.

CBSE will not let any child suffer academically due to Covid-19. A second chance will be given, so no need to panic.\u00e2\u0080\u009dDably feels that voluntary disclosure won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no guarantee that people will tell the truth.

While it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still to come \u00e2\u0080\u0098officially\u00e2\u0080\u0099 from Indian authorities, global attention is focusing on a new variant \u00e2\u0080\u0094 B.1.617 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that appears significantly more infectious in India. There is a theory that this variant emerged in Amravati , and caused the huge surge in cases in nearby districts in February.International researchers believe that this variant is typically of Indian origin . As a result, researchers and media houses from across the globe are now focusing on Vidarbha; and some of them even visited Nagpur while tracing the new \u00e2\u0080\u0098Indian variant\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s different than the UK, or Africa or Brazil variant, which have been discussed at the start of this wave,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said infectious disease specialist Dr Nitin Shinde, who has been receiving inquiries from many international researchers and journalists about the second wave in India.\u00e2\u0080\u009cMany countries have imposed travel ban to India. UK has added India into \u00e2\u0080\u0098red list\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of restricted destination. This is because specific variant of the virus \u00e2\u0080\u0093 B.1.617 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is becoming increasingly common,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr Shinde. He believes the Amravati surge was also due to this variant, though it needs to be confirmed with more research.As per the data shared by Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GSAID), B.1.617 was first found in samples collected in December 2020 in India. They have data of genome sequencing of Indian samples up to April 3, 2021. Until then, this variant was visible in 29% of the samples in India. According to doctors, it is responsible for the second wave and is now spreading across the country.GSAID is recognized for its importance to global health by G20 health ministers. In 2020, WHO called this data-science initiative \u00e2\u0080\u0098a game changer\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in Covid-19.Dr Atul Gawande, who hails from Umarkhed in Yavatmal district of Vidarbha, and is currently a member of Covid-19 control advisory team of US President Joe Biden , has also expressed his concerns about this variant while calling it as \u00e2\u0080\u0098extremely frightening\u00e2\u0080\u0099. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am seeing this variant go through entire households of my family in India. Whether it is more lethal, and whether vaccines work well against it, remains unclear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.As noted by Dr Gawande, it has been observed especially in Vidarbha that this variant is infecting entire families, unlike its predecessors in September 2020 wave. This means, the virus is significantly more infectious. But whether it is lethal or not is still to be studied. At present, the variant is \u00e2\u0080\u009cunder investigation\u00e2\u0080\u009d.

The government has calculated district will be short of 45,305 beds as per projected cases and directed the authorities to ramp up the infrastructure.\n\nActive cases were 71,557 in the district on Wednesday. It means an increase of 52,123 by May 2 as per the projection. It also means the current surge continuing. The district is already having a severe shortage of oxygen beds. Situation of beds in ICU and with ventilators is even worse.\n\nAs per government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s projection, the district will be short of 10,476 beds with oxygen, 1,945 ICU beds and 520 beds with ventilators. Remaining shortage of 32,364 beds is in isolation facilities or Covid Care Centres (CCCs).\n\nSince beginning of second wave, less than 1% of active patients have been in CCCs. The government had time and again directed the authorities to ensure 40% of patients are kept in CCCs for containing the spread and preventing deaths. Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC), district administration and Zilla Parishad (ZP) failed to comply with the directives saying patients were not ready to move into CCCs.\n\nAs against norm of having no more than 20% active patients in home isolation, the district has around 80%. Guardian minister Nitin Raut told TOI, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are making all efforts to increase the beds with oxygen supply. Two Jumbo Covid Hospitals with 1,600 beds and new Covid Hospitals are proposed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nInfectious diseases specialist Dr Nitin Shinde said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAccess to medical care is very necessary to control deaths. District should have been equipped with necessary number of beds by now as the second wave has lasted 12 weeks in other countries. We are witnessing second wave for last nine weeks and it is likely to go on until end of May. Vaccination and full lockdown are not likely to work as district is facing community spread. Need is to develop makeshift facilities where people can get oxygen, CT scan, diagnosis and treatment on time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nExcept Amravati, all districts of Vidarbha are likely to face severe shortage of beds as per projected active cases.\n\nActive cases in the district on April 19 (76,961) were 354% more than highest number in first wave (21,746). Among 35 districts in the state, Nagpur is at fourth place after Pune, Mumbai and Thane.\n\nTwo districts of Vidarbha- Bhandara and Chandrapur\u00e2\u0080\u0094 are on top as far as weekly growth rate of the cases is concerned. Weekly growth rate of Bhandara is 3.63% and Chandrapur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 3.48%. For Nagpur it is 2.24%, probably due to high number of cases in last month. Except Yavatmal, Akola and Amravati, all districts of Vidarbha are in the red category in weekly growth rate.\n\nNagpur district (3,22,091) is second after Mumbai (4,11,998) in testing per million population. Bhandara (2,02,934) is fifth and Wardha (1,86,022) sixth. Remaining eight districts are in the red category due to less testing.\n\nThree Vidarbha districts Nagpur (35.02%), Gadchiroli (34.3%) and Gondia (33.23%) are in red category as far as weekly test positivity rate is concerned.\n\nAfter Kolhapur, Bhandara and Nagpur districts are in second and third place for vaccination of 45-plus population. Coverage is 41.48% (1,57,442 vaccinated against 3,79,532 eligible persons) in Bhandara district and 41% (6,48,541 vaccinated against 15,81,800 eligible persons) in Nagpur district.\n\n"},

In such emergency situation in Maharashtra that accounts for over 40% of Covid cases, the ministry should have increased the oxygen quota to 200-300MT/day. Unfortunately, reverse has happened and it has adversely hit the patients in Maharashtra in general and Vidarbha in particular,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the bench said, adding that the plant would continue to supply 110MT per day of oxygen till further orders.Earlier, amicus curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar assisted by Sejal Lakhani along with interveners M Anil Kumar and Tushar Mandlekar assisted by Rohan Malviya pointed out that the respondent authorities have failed to comply with HC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders to supply 10,000 Remdesvir vials to Nagpur district and also to ensure oxygen supply to the Covid hospitals.The judges then directed assistant solicitor general Ulhas Aurangabadkar and government pleader Ketki Joshi to seek instruction in this regard from the Centre and state. They also slammed the state for not complying with their orders of supplying 10,000 Remdesivir vials to Nagpur by Tuesday evening.\u00e2\u0080\u009cToday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directives would start providing some relief to distressed patients from Thursday, but certainly it would take time. Therefore, something for the present is required to be done if we have to perform our duty to protect citizens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives as per Article 21,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they said.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe would emphasise that Nagpur Covid-19 Committee must make efforts to procure Remdesivir vials today itself in sufficient quantity and also augment supply of oxygen to Covid hospitals. For this purpose, the committee will have to have a meeting with the managers of depots of the seven manufacturing companies, their clearing and forwarding agents and all stockists and distributors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the judges said.The HC bench directed divisional commissioner to expedite process of setting up a jumbo Covid hospital at Uttam Galva steel plant near Wardha.Earlier, the commissioner informed that the architect and designer would decide on how much beds could be accommodated at the facility they had inspected. He said modalities are being worked out and efforts are being made to set up 1,000 beds there.The commissioner assured that the administration would try to start the facility within 20 days. However, the bench told him to expedite work and start it within 15 days.Expressing concern over short supply of Remdesvir to GMCH, the HC ordered FDA joint commissioner to supply 100 vials by midnight and submit a report. The directives came after GMCH dean Dr Sudhir Gupta informed the bench that they hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t received even a single dose on Wednesday for its 900 Covid patients.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have received specific information from different quarters, but we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to reveal our source.

We also direct the GMCH dean to send SMS to the registrar judicial after getting 100 vials,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the judges said."},

While some unscrupulous ones are capitalizing on the opportunity to make fast money, the more conscientious ones are counselling the kin to have patience and faith.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have paid Rs 25,000 to purchase one vial of Remdesivir for treatment my kin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a security guard who somehow managed the amount.\n\nTOI also come across a person who admitted to buying a replacement of Tocilizumab for Rs85,000 to save his mother. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe standard price of Remdesivir in the black-market is between Rs15,000 to Rs30,000 depending upon the buyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capacity. Black marketing is rampant in other districts too, especially Amravati where the infection has spread fast and the toll is high too,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said an insider.\n\nAccording to a senior pharmacist from Gandhibagh, the hospitals must stop issuing prescriptions to the patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 kin for Remdesivir or Tocilizumab \u00e2\u0080\u009cas it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paving way for black marketing\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen doctors and hospitals know that collector has issued order stopping retail sale of Remdesivir, then why are they issuing prescriptions?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the pharmacist.\n\nCity police chief Amitesh Kumar, who has cracked down on Remdesivir black marketeers, warned the patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 kin against approaching such people. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBuying or attempting to buy Remdesivir or other drugs from black marketeers is as criminally liable as its sale. There could be a fraud too and one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard-earned money can go down the drain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nBullion trader Rajesh Rokde, who is an office-bearer of city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sarafa association, said has received at least 25 calls in the last few days from people wanting to sell off or mortgage their gold. They all said it was either to foot the hospital bill or to buy Remdesivir. As our shops are closed, we had to divert them to different financial institutions and banks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rokde.\n\nAccording to a real estate broker from north Nagpur, he has been receiving calls from people requesting help to sell off their farms, lands and other properties. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDistress sale calls have certainly increased but there are not much buyers too due to the economic slowdown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n"},

This prevented them from concentrating on treating the patients. As per sources, for the second consecutive day on Wednesday, the city received around 1,000 vials of Remdesivir with the death count reaching 98.Sources from the district and Food and Drugs Administration stated that long queues at Bhilai plant and slow movement of the tankers have added to the problem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is heavy rush at the Bhilai plant as the demand for oxygen is from many states. Also, tankers have to move at 4o kmph to avoid dangerous breaking,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a senior official from the district administration, adding that a tanker takes \u00e2\u0080\u009cat least three days to reach Nagpur from Bhilai\u00e2\u0080\u009d.The FDA, following heavy protests over shortage of oxygen by some hospitals, is learnt to have reframed the oxygen allotment policy for Covid and non-Covid patients. Some hospitals are learnt to be receiving a separate quota of oxygen for non-Covid patients now to avoid inconvenience.It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also learnt that the chief secretary has written to the commissioner of the Skill Development Department to extend help in setting up an oxygen plant for clinical use at Mahagenco sites at Khaparkheda in Nagpur, Paras in Akola and Parli in Beed. The state government has also urged district collectors to focus on setting up more oxygen-generation plants.After the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anxious wait, some of the hospitals on Wednesday got a few vials of Remdesivir (Orange City Hospital and Research Institute got 17 vials). While a couple received one and there were some like Radiance hospital in east Nagpur which did not receive even a single vial.The Remdesivir allotment was made from some of the stock which was received on Tuesday. It was nowhere close to the demands of more than 16,000 vials for the existing patients at different hospitals.Dr Anup Marar, convenor of the Vidarbha Hospital Association (VHA) and managing director at Orange City, said he had to set up a clinical committee to decide the names of the patient who would get those 17 injections. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have got 17 cylinders of oxygen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Dr Manoj Purohit, of the Radiance hospital, said he received no stock of Remdesivir but is hopeful of being provided some when the vials arrive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are continuing with whatever drugs possible to replace Remdesivir but recovery would certainly be slow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.While the hospitals claimed to be under stress for not receiving Remdesivir, the district administration kept the fingers crossed about receiving more stock on Thursday. After being heavily pulled up by the high court, the district administration and FDA are trying to fetch more stock from the manufacturers.Oxygen shortage too kept the hospital managements, district administration and FDA on their toes. With a shortfall of at least 25-30 metric tonnes, the district administration remained engaged in rationing the supply to hospitals.According to Ehtesham Parekh, a social worker engaged in providing free oxygen cylinders, his vehicle is waiting at \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe supply station where there is a serpentine queue\u00e2\u0080\u009d and his turn \u00e2\u0080\u009cis expected to come after several hours\u00e2\u0080\u009d.According to Dr Praveen Bais of Nucleus Mother and Child Hospital, said he got some oxygen cylinders which helped him save some patients.A relative of a patient told TOI that he managed to get one oxygen cylinder on his own allowing the kin to continue treatment in the same hospital. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI took an empty oxygen cylinder from the hospital and got a refill after roaming for hours. I had to pay Rs 1,500 for refilling whereas its costs around Rs 400 during normal times. I had no option as finding a bed in another hospital is impossible. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how I will manage this again,\u00e2\u0080\u009dhe said.BOXHighway patrol on alert, UpadhyayAdditional DG (state traffic) BK Upadhyay said the highway patrol police have been alerted to remain on toes to ensure smooth movement of the oxygen tankers across the state. He said state government has told the highway patrol department to ensure the oxygen tankers are not obstructed or held up at traffic snarls."},

But frankly, many times we feel helpless because there is so much shortage of everything that people are disappointed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Tank.\n\nA city corporator, who did not wish to be named, said this may have a negative impact on the next civic polls. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are able to help just 1%-2% of our constituents currently.

Before the uncle could wish him, Abhimanyu asked him if any hospital in Warangal would take his father, whose SPO2 had dipped to 71% while the HRCT scan score was 23.Within the next two hours, the Pagade family had left Nagpur for Warangal, where the ailing vegetable vendor beat Covid in four days and was discharged on April 14.On April 9, TOI had reported about Abhimanyu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brave decision to move his father 460km away to neighbouring Telangana state in a basic life support ambulance.Abhimanyu and his parents are still in Warangal as they need to follow up treatment for some more days.

On Tuesday, a tiger on the Agarzari-Mohurli road near Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) caused a flutter among passers-by. The animal did not harm anyone even though curious people got down from their vehicles for a closer look at the animal.\n\nTadoba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wildlife biologist Prajakta Hushangabadkar, who was returning from work to reach Mohurli, said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe tiger was sighted at 5 pm. The animal suddenly came out of the woods near Kalapani nullah ahead of Navargaon chowki and walked a few metres before squatting on the road. Around 25 people on two-wheelers and four-wheelers were at hand to catch a glimpse of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough it was wrong on the part of the people to come out of their vehicles, the tiger did not harm anyone nor was it pestered. Studying factors that mitigate conflict and encourage coexistence are key steps to maintain a healthy relationship between humans and wildlife,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hushangabadkar.\n\nThe tiger is said to a male sub-adult cub of Chhoti Madhuri, a resident tigress of Agarzari forest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe situation would not have been similar had the tiger been sighted in the territorial forest area. Tadoba tigers have regular interface with tourists and villagers and have understood that humans are not their food nor threat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said TATR deputy director (core) Nandkishore Kale.\n\nThe tiger must have come out of the forest owing to sparse traffic on the road which, otherwise, is busy when tourism is open. Tigers and other wild animals have been sighted frequently on the forested Padmapur-Mohurli road and there has been no record of a tiger attacking any passer-by. The pictures of the tiger went viral on social media with thousands of comments and likes on Twitter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the best example of coexistence. The tiger did not attack anyone despite being so close. It also sends a message that the big cats will never attack any human deliberately. However, these carnivores have been dubbed as villains following series of attacks on humans in Chandrapur, where most of the attacks occur when people come in their critical distance while collecting forest produce in the jungles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said state wildlife board member Bandu Dhotre.\n\nIn 2020, 88 people were killed in Maharashtra in wild animal attacks. Out of this, 35 were in Chandrapur district alone. Even in the last three months of 2021, 13 villages have died in the district alone. All the victims had ventured into the forest for collection of non-timber forest produce.\n\n"},

Bus operators will have to stamp the passengers' hands to indicate they are supposed to stay at home for 14 days.On Thursday, police vans made rounds of the main streets in Mumbai asking people on the loudspeaker to stay home and avoid crowding.Police have put up barricades at the entry and exit gates of suburban railway stations to prevent unauthorised people from travelling in local trains.Police personnel manned the streets to check motorists and cars for the yellow, green and red stickers which are to be used for specific purpose while moving around during the period of restrictions.On Thursday, Maharashtra reported 67,013 fresh coronavirus cases, taking the tally to 40,94,840, while 568 more patients succumbed to the infection, said a health department official."},

Under the Act, having sexual relations with a minor is a punishable offence. The court further said the accused being a Jain would not have called a qazi, but a priest at most to perform their marriage.\n\nCourt: Impossible to deceive woman married for 16 years\n\nHe (accused) will not give the writing in Urdu paper like nikahnama because he, being from the Jain community, must not be knowing Urdu. Therefore, there is place to suspect that this activity could have been done by the informant (woman), and not by the accused,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the court said.\n\nThe woman had told court that she had married her now 14-year-old son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father in 2004 but divorced him after she began a relationship with the accused in September 2018. She alleged that he had sex with her despite protests on the promise of marriage. She claimed that due to financial issues, he even took 50gm of gold from her and hypothecated her bike.\n\nShe said last August he called a \u00e2\u0080\u0098qazi\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and married her. She claimed that after staying with her for few days, intermittently, he would drop her off at her \u00e2\u0080\u009cex-husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Earlier this year, she said, he dumped her saying his family did not accept their marriage. She claimed that he was 26 and had submitted a fake Aadhaar card in court, claiming he was born in August 2000.\n\nThe court, however, pointed out that even the birth certificate copy showed he was 20. \u00e2\u0080\u009c...Police merely relied on supplementary statement of informant (woman) but never got verified facts about the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age either from his school or municipal records,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the court said.\n\nThe court said prima facie, under such circumstances, it was not only difficult but impossible for the accused to deceive the woman who was married for 16 years, had a 12-yearold son (in 2018) and lived with her husband. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTherefore, her contention that he deceived her and forcibly raped her on the night of September 21, 2018 appears to be prima facie an improper case,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the court said.\n\nIt said that given the circumstances, it would have been impossible for her to frequently take shelter in her exhusband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis prima facie leads to doubts about genuineness of her talaq,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the court said.\n\n"},

Establishments allowed to function under the essential services category, like pet shops, data centres, cargo offices and petrol pumps, should work at 50% capacity.Exempted establishments like banks, insurance offices and advocates\u00e2\u0080\u0099 offices shall function at 15% of their workforce or five persons, whichever is more. Domestic help may continue to work as they do now. Public and private buses will continue to ply, but with 50% capacity. Stringent rules have been imposed on inter-city and even inter-district travel.Private vehicles will be allowed at 50% capacity within the city in case of emergency or for essential services. Inter-city or inter-district travel is allowed only for essential services, medical emergencies or attending events like a funeral.Violation of these rules will attract a penalty of Rs 10,000.Conditions have been laid down for inter-district and inter-city travel in private buses as well as long distance trains and public transport buses. The private bus operator should limit stops to a maximum of two in a city and the schedule should be made available to the local disaster management authority.All passengers alighting from trains, public buses and private buses should be stamped for 14-day home quarantine by the operator or local body staff.Local authorities may conduct antigen tests of passengers and may ask the passenger to foot the bill.Depending on local conditions, the state has given local bodies the freedom to decide on doing away with the home quarantine stamping rule for passengers arriving from certain origins.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe idea is to deter people from stepping out and travelling unnecessarily. We have not shut down private and public transport completely to avoid panic,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an official said.Weddings have been restricted to just one ceremony to be completed within two hours at a hall with not more than 25 people in attendance. The penalty for violations has been increased from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000.All ground-level staff engaged in delivery of essential items should be minimised, but may continue at 100% capacity if required.These new rules came a day after the cabinet had demanded a strict lockdown in the state to control the Covid-19 cases."},

The promoter also alleged that the complainants had taken advantage of a typographical error in the AFS to claim two parking spaces.\n\nHowever, MahaRERA member Vijay Satbir Singh observed the possession letter is for fit-out possession and there is no provision of fit-out possession under RERA .

The waiting list has at least 172 patients with 64 of them critical with high oxygen support requirement. Thus, the bed capacity is under-utilised due to lack of oxygen,\" the plea said.It said that as of 10 AM on Thursday morning, the hospital had only an LMO (Liquid medical oxygen) supply of 60 minutes left, after which it has taken the desperate back up measure of using oxygen cylinders support which will last another few hours at the most and is likely to run out in the afternoon.The plea said in the morning, Inox pleaded helplessness in providing oxygen when the last supply was at its brink.The high court on Wednesday night directed the Centre to beg, borrow or steal or do whatever to supply medical oxygen to hospitals for treatment of Covid-19 patients.Delhi logged 24,638 fresh Covid-19 cases and 249 deaths due to the viral disease on Wednesday while the positivity rate stood at 31.28 per cent, meaning almost every third sample tested positive, amid a growing clamour for oxygen and hospital beds in the city.The national capital's cumulative tally rose to 9,30,179 and the death toll stood at 12,887, according to Wednesday's health bulletin."},

The Delhi high court Thursday observed that the Covid-19 situation in the national capital has turned \"precarious\" with many hospitals running out of oxygen and directed the Centre to ensure the gas is supplied to the city as per the planned allocation and without any hindrances.\"We all know that this country is being run by god,\" observed an anguish bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli which was of the view that all measures should be taken for removing obstructions in the transportation of oxygen.If the government wants it can do anything and can even make \"heaven meet earth,\" it said.The high court directed all the authorities concerned, which are bound by the order passed under the Disaster Management Act, to ensure strict compliance of the Centre's direction that there shall be no restriction on inter-State and intra-State movement of persons and goods, including medical oxygen.The bench made it clear that non-compliance of the order will be viewed seriously since it is going to result in grave loss of lives and will invite criminal action.\"We also direct all the authorities concerned who are bound by the order passed under the Disaster Management Act to ensure strict compliance.\"We also direct the Central Government to ensure allocation of oxygen takes place as planned and transportation of the tankers takes place unhindered,\" the bench said and added that they shudder to think what will be the condition in other states.It also directed that adequate security be provided to lorries transporting oxygen so that they move without obstructions and dedicated corridors be made for transportation of oxygen to hospitals.The court was informed by the Centre that the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an order to all the states and union territories to ensure that no restriction shall be imposed on the movement of medical oxygen between the states and transport authorities shall be instructed to accordingly allow free inter-State movement of oxygen carrying vehicles.The ministry ordered that no restrictions shall be imposed on oxygen manufacturers and suppliers to limit the oxygen supplies only to the hospitals of the State or UT in which they are located.The direction came after the Delhi government told the court that the amount of oxygen that was to come here from Panipat in Haryana was not being allowed to be picked up by the local police there.The high court said the Centre's allocation of oxygen for Delhi from plants in other states like Haryana was not being respected by the local administration there and it needs to be resolved immediately.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, also told the court that oxygen which was to be picked up from some units in Uttar Pradesh could also be not lifted from there.With regard to Delhi government's suggestion to transport oxygen by air, the bench said research by its legal researchers has shown that airlifting of oxygen was very dangerous and it has to be transported either by road or rail.Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, told the bench \"If there is any roadblock by any individuals or any officers, the officers have been instructed that if they are involved in any such activity they will be departmentally dealt with\".He said if individuals are involved, then protection would be provided to ensure the commitments are met.\"We must respond with a sense of urgency and sense of responsibility which the situation demands,\" the SG said.During the hearing, Mehta informed the court that the Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of the prevailing grim situation of Covid-19 pandemic across the country.He said the apex court wants a \"national plan\" on issues including supply of oxygen and essential drugs for treatment of patients infected with the virus.He also said the apex court has also agreed to hear Vedanta's plea for opening of its Sterlite copper unit at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu on the ground that it would produce thousand tonnes of oxygen only for medical purpose and will give it free of cost to the Centre to treat Covid-19 patients.The bench, while dictating its order, said \"the position in Delhi has turned rather precarious with several hospitals reporting that either they have insufficient oxygen or will not last for longer period.\"The high court had on Wednesday evening issued strong strictures against the Central government and private industries and had ordered the Centre to \"forthwith\" provide oxygen by whatever means to hospitals here facing shortage of the gas in treating serious Covid-19 patients, observing it \"seems human life is not important for the state\".\"You are not exploring all avenues to augment oxygen supply. Beg, borrow or steal,\" the court had told the Centre, and asked why it was not waking up to the gravity of the emergency situation. It also warned that certainly all hell will break loose with the stoppage of medical oxygen to the hospitals.The observations and directions by the court came on Wednesday during hearing of a plea filed by Balaji Medical and Research Centre, which owns and runs various hospitals in the name of Max, contending that if supply of oxygen is not replenished on an immediate basis, the lives of the patients who are critical and on oxygen support will be endangered."},

He has assured complete support to Delhi in facilitating lifting of Delhi's quota of oxygen from Orissa. He has put a spl officer on the job. Thank u sooo much Sir. Delhi is indeed grateful,\" Kejriwal tweeted.Kejriwal also spoke to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and sought his help in facilitating transport of oxygen trucks from the neighbouring state to Delhi, and claimed he assured \"full support\".He said Delhi had a daily quota of 378 MT of medical oxygen that has been increased to 480 MT, and thanked the Central government for it.But, he said, more supplies are needed as according to estimates Delhi needs 700 MT of oxygen daily.Delhi received its quota of oxygen as fixed by the Centre from other states, he said, but claimed, some states stopped trucks headed to the national capital.\"This is not fair. This is a huge calamity and we need to fight it unitedly. If we are divided, India will not survive,\" Kejriwal said.He appealed to state governments to help each other and promised to provide them surplus oxygen, medicines and doctors if the Covid-19 situation came under control in Delhi.The newly increased quota of oxygen is going to be supplied primarily from Odisha and the Delhi government is trying its best to airlift oxygen from the state to cut down on the time in its transportation, Kejriwal said.With the rise in coronavirus cases in the country, demands for oxygen cylinders, medicines and vaccination has increased and its shortage is being felt, he said.\"We, in Delhi, have also faced an acute shortage of oxygen cylinders. The Delhi government has spent a number of sleepless nights trying to arrange oxygen in hospitals and other Covid care centres to try and ensure that no patient suffers due to lack of it.\"The problem that has arisen is that the states in which these oxygen manufacturers are based are not allowing oxygen cylinders to come to Delhi, he claimed.\"They say they want to use the oxygen in their own states. Trucks supplying oxygen are being stopped. We are thankful to the Central government and the Delhi High Court who have aided us in this situation. Trucks have slowly started reaching Delhi,\" he said.\"This is a collective crisis. If we decide to split ourselves into Haryana, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, West Bengal, India will not survive. We need to come together and unite as Indians and as human beings,\" Kejriwal appealed.He said people in these troubled times want to see and hear states helping each other and not fighting over resources.The country cannot afford to get divided into states at this point, he said, appealing state governments to come together to work and increase resources and manpower to overcome the crisis.\"We need to show the world what good and efficient governance looks like. We will show the world how, despite having the largest number of coronavirus cases in the world, we were able to defeat the virus by coming together,\" the CM added.As per official sources, many private and Delhi government hospitals were running low of oxygen on Thursday afternoon with some having supplies to last for 3-4 hours only."},

Of the 120 patients in the hospital at present, 70 are in a critical condition,\" an official said, adding that many lives will be lost if oxygen supply did not reach the hospital in time.An official from Shanti Mukund Hospital told PTI they have not been able to get in touch with their oxygen supplier.\"There are 110 coronavirus patients in the hospital right now. We have no option but to send patients to other hospitals,\" he said.Dr Sanjeev Sharma, chief operating officer at Delhi Heart and Lung Institute, said their oxygen stock will last till 4 pm.\"Supplier provided the last refill in the morning; we are on our own. A total of 71 patients are on O2 support,\" he said.Officials at the 210-bed Mata Chanan Devi Hospital sent an SOS to the Delhi government as their \"oxygen supplier didn't fulfil commitments\".\"Around 40 patients are in ICU. We got 500 kg oxygen last night. The supplier was supposed to give more at 4 am, but they have not been picking up calls since then,\" ICU Head Dr A C Shukla said.\"With the Delhi government's intervention, we have got 21 D-type cylinders, but a continuous supply is needed. The situation is very serious,\" he added.Dr Pankaj Solanki, who runs the 50-bed Dharamveer Solanki Hospital, said the hospital is using the \"backup\" which will last till Thursday afternoon.Dr Solanki said he had informed officials concerned to transfer out 30 patients.\"The oxygen crisis is at its worst. It is adding more pressure on the functioning. No one is able to help,\" his tweet read.Meanwhile, some hospitals received fresh stock overnight and more is likely to come in soon.Dr Suresh Kumar , the medical director at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, said three tankers carrying oxygen reached the facility last night.\"At 8:30am, we have around 8 hours of oxygen left. More is coming,\" he told PTI.An official at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said supply was replenished around 6am.\"The stock will last till 10 am Friday. Supply from a private vendor is awaited,\" he said.Officials at the Burari Hospital said they have \"sufficient stock\" till afternoon.Spokesperson of the St Stephen's Hospital said they received fresh supply on Wednesday evening and the stock can last till 4pm.\"More to come around noon,\" he added.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged the Uttar Pradesh and Haryana police were blocking oxygen transport to Delhi, and urged the Centre to ensure normal supply even if that meant taking the help of paramilitary forces.This \"jungle raj\" has been going on for three days, he said referring to the alleged blocking of oxygen supply.\"Some hospitals in Delhi have run out of oxygen completely. They don't have any option available. I have been receiving calls, messages, e-mails. We have been making internal, makeshift arrangements, but this cannot continue for long,\" he said. Sisodia, who is also the nodal minister for Covid-19 management in Delhi, said it will become tough to save lives of coronavirus patients after sometime if hospitals did not get the oxygen supply they need.\"The Centre should take the help of paramilitary forces, if needed, and ensure supply of oxygen to Delhi,\" he said, adding that else the situation may become \"very dangerous\" in days to come.Delhi logged 24,638 coronavirus cases and 249 deaths on Wednesday, as the positivity rate stood at 31.28 percent -- meaning almost every third sample turned out to be positive -- amid a growing clamour for oxygen and hospital beds in the city.Only 16 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients were available in hospitals across Delhi at 3pm, according to government data.On Tuesday, the city had recorded 28,395 cases and 277 fatalities, both highest since the pandemic began ravaging countries. The positivity rate was 32.82 per cent, highest so far.The national capital has reported over 1,350 deaths due to the deadly virus in the last 7 days."},

So far, 2,000 beds have been given,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told reporters.\n\nThe number of beds are being increased, but Delhi has been facing a \u00e2\u0080\u009cserious problem\u00e2\u0080\u009d with regard to oxygen supply for the last three days, Jain said.\n\nThe Centre increased Delhi's quota of oxygen on Wednesday (from 378 metric tonnes to 480 metric tonnes). However, oxygen is also needed for new Covid centres being operationalised in Delhi, the minister said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeds for Covid patients will be increased in a large number once this crisis ends,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the minister said.\n\nJain said hospitals in Delhi grappled with a shortage of oxygen the entire night. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe supply had almost finished in some hospitals. Thereafter, small quantities of oxygen were distributed among hospitals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nOn Thursday morning, several small hospitals in Delhi struggled to replenish oxygen supply for their patients, even as some big healthcare facilities received fresh stock overnight.\n\nThe Delhi high court had on Wednesday night ordered the Centre to \"forthwith\" provide oxygen by whatever means to hospitals here facing shortage of the gas in treating serious Covid-19 patients, observing it \u00e2\u0080\u009cseems human life is not important for the state\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe central government, represented by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, assured the court that it will facilitate supply of the increased allocation of 480 metric tonnes of oxygen to Delhi and the same will reach the national capital without any obstructions.\n\nHowever, several private hospitals complained that no help has reached them.\n\nOfficials at the 210-bed Mata Chanan Devi Hospital sent an SOS to the Delhi government as their \u00e2\u0080\u009coxygen supplier didn't fulfil commitments\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAround 40 patients are in ICU. We got 500 kg oxygen last night. The supplier was supposed to give more at 4 am, but they have not been picking up calls since then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the hospital's ICU head Dr A C Shukla said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith the Delhi government's intervention, we have got 21 D-type cylinders, but a continuous supply is needed. The situation is very serious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\n\nDr Pankaj Solanki, who runs Dharamveer Solanki Hospital, a facility with 50 beds, said they are using the \u00e2\u0080\u009cback up\u00e2\u0080\u009d which will last till Thursday afternoon.\n\nDr Solanki said he had informed officials concerned to transfer out 30 patients.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe oxygen crisis is at its worst. It is adding more pressure on the functioning. No one is able to help,\u00e2\u0080\u009d his tweet posted on Wednesday evening read.\n\nDr Sanjeev Shama, chief operating officer at Delhi Heart and Lung Institute, says only three hours of oxygen was left at 12:30 pm. \"The supplier provided the last refill in the morning, Now, we are on our own.\"\n\nSeventy-one patients are on oxygen support in the hospital, he said.\n\n"},

Their government officers and police are not letting supply from their oxygen plants come to Delhi. Our officers spoke to theirs and I tried to speak to the Centre but things are not changing on the ground,\" Sisodia said.He further emphasised that this was not the time to fight but to be united.\"When the central government yesterday increased Delhi's oxygen allocation and fixed the same for other states too, why are the governments of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh behaving as if they have some dispute with Delhi? This is not the time to fight each other but to be united,\" he said.As of Wednesday, before the Centre increased the oxygen quota, Delhi had been allocated 378 MT of oxygen. Out of this, only 177 MT reached Delhi because of the 'dadagiri' of the UP and Haryana Police, Sisodia claimed.Elaborating on the situation, he said that the day before yesterday the Uttar Pradesh police and state officials had not allowed the delivery of oxygen to Delhi, and yesterday, supply was stopped once again in Haryana.He appealed to the central government to intervene in the matter, even if it meant deploying paramilitary forces to travel with the oxygen tankers.\"With folded hands, I appeal to the central government to intervene in this matter. Since the state police is involved in stopping these oxygen tankers, please intervene even if you need to deploy paramilitary forces,\" the Centre added.Over the last few days, the national capital's health infrastructure has started to crack under the weight city's fourth Covid-19 wave.As many as 24,638 new cases and 249 related deaths were reported in Delhi on Wednesday, the Delhi health department informed.There are currently 85,364 active cases in the city, while the death toll stands at a grim 12,887. The fatality rate in Delhi stands at 1.39 per cent. The Covid-19 positivity rate in the city is 31.28 per cent."},

It was touchand-go whether they would get oxygen replenished quickly enough to avoid a catastrophe.After Delhi government persisted with its demand from the Centre for enhancing the oxygen supply, the Centre increased Delhi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quota from 378 metric tonnes to 480 metric tonnes. The government has, however, written to the Centre for 700 metric tonnes.While the increased amount will take some time to reach Delhi, suppliers were reported to be facing obstruction from district authorities of Haryana and UP. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said a Haryana government official stopped the oxygen supply earmarked for Delhi from a Faridabad, causing many several hospitals to run out of the gas.Sisodia urged the Centre to ensure that states do not stop the oxygen supply from reaching the state they are earmarked for because a joint effort is needed to fight Covid.The increased quota will come from states like Odisha, West Bengal, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. Delhi government sources pointed it out as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca matter of grave concern\u00e2\u0080\u009d that of the 480 metric tonnes, 100 metric tonnes that will come from Odisha (70 metric tonnes) and West Bengal (30 metric tonnes) will take almost 72 hours to reach Delhi. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur citizens, our hospitals, our city are running out of time. Meanwhile, the 140 metric tonnes, which Haryana has to supply, is yet to leave for Delhi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a source.On Monday and Tuesday, around 240 metric tonnes and 365 metric tonnes of oxygen had been supplied to the capital against a daily requirement of 700 metric tonnes.Since Delhi does not have its own source of oxygen, its supplies come from Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Despite health being a state subject, the power related to oxygen supply lies with the central government, which decides which state will get how much oxygen. Given the new, far more virulent wave of Covid-19, Delhi has seen a huge rise in demand for oxygen. Among them are many patients from other states who have come to Delhi to get treated. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had recently drawn the attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the gravity of the situation.Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals claimed that it had only 10-12 hours of oxygen supply available while Manipal Hospital , too, expressed concern that they had a back-up of merely 12 hours. Max Hospital, Patparganj, which has around 262 Covid patients, said it had enough for about three hours while Max Shalimar Bagh, with 285 Covid patients, had oxygen backup for only about two hours, according to a government report. Hospitals should ideally have about three days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 stock with them. The Max hospitals got their supplies later at night even as Delhi High Court was conducting a hearing on the matter.The situation remained grim at Delhi government hospitals too. Last night, GTB Hospital just about managed to avert a mass tragedy when it received an emergency supply of oxygen for over 500 patients admitted there.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is indeed unfortunate that states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are curtailing the supply of live-saving oxygen to Delhi. Just like the Haryana government, the Uttar Pradesh government, too, has illegally captured the oxygen production plants, depriving Delhi of oxygen. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worse is that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re indulging in this insensitive act despite clear orders from the high court,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a Delhi government source.Earlier in the day, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had thanked the central government for incresaing the oxygen supply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are grateful to the Centre for this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Addressing a presser, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis morning, several hospitals ran out of oxygen because the supply which was supposed to come from a plant in Faridabad did not arrive. A district official reached the plant and stopped the life-saving oxygen vehicles from going to Delhi. When the Centre decides on the issue of oxygen, no state government should have the authority to stop the supply of oxygen.\u00e2\u0080\u009dSisodia said the way Covid cases have increased exponentially in Delhi and many patients from other states have come to Delhi to get treated, there was a greater need for more and more oxygen supply in Delhi.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reason for limited supply of oxygen in many hospitals in Delhi today is that oxygen that was earmarked for Delhi from a plant in Faridabad was directed towards Haryana by an official of the Haryana government. A similar thing had happened on Tuesday at a plant near Modi Nagar when we had to call a union minister. It was only after his help that the oxygen supply reached Delhi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Sisodia said."},

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams ( TTD ) that manages the ancient shrine of Lord Venkateswara declared the place called Japali Theertham on Anjanadri as Hanuman Janmbhoomi on Wednesday on the occasion of Ram Navami following an eight-member expert committee submitted its report.\n\nDismayed by the development, Karnataka has decided to lay its claim with a renewed vigour that Hanuman was born on the hill also called Anjanadri in Kishkinda near Anegundi in Koppal districts, which abuts the heritage site of Hampi. However, authorities said Karnataka would not prefer confrontation with AP, but wants to settle the issue through consultation based on archaeological and mythological evidence.\n\n\"We don't know what made Andhra Pradesh raking up this issue suddenly. This comes at a time when the Karnataka government has embarked on a plan to develop Anjanadri in Kishkinda as a pilgrimage-tourist destination as this is the place that has been authentically identified as Hanuman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birthplace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said KS Eswarappa, Karnataka minister for rural development and panchayat raj.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTirumala is a great pilgrimage centre and there is no dispute about its sthalapurana (ancient history). While we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to enter into a dispute with the AP government, we will study the evidence they are providing to prove their argument. We will ask experts to verify it and if needed we will seek a survey by the Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) on the lines of the Varanasi court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to settle the matter over Kashi Vishwanath Temple,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Eswarappa added.\n\nBased on many epic and mythological references including that of Ramayana \u00e2\u0080\u0099s chapters Kishkindha Kaand and Sundara Kaand, it was believed from ages that Kishkindha is the place where Ram and Lakshman met Hanuman as they came in search of Sita. It is also believed that Anjanadevi gave birth to Hanuman on a hill in Kishkindha and so the hillock got the name Anjanadri. The TTD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument is that Anajanadevi did tapasya in Tirumala, following which Hanuman was born and the hillock thus named Anjanadri and Hanuman later went to Kishkindha.\n\nThe stakeholders from both sides, however, hope the issue will be settled amicably since it does not involve religious dispute.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe made the declaration based on the available evidence that proves that Anjanadri in Tirumala is Hanuman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Janmabhoomi and Kishikindha was his karmabhoomi.

Tanveer Ahmed of Mercy Angels, who was with the family from 4 pm till they completed the rites at around 2am, told TOI they had decided on the Kudlu Gate crematorium as he had seen only a few people there a day earlier.But when they reached the crematorium on Tuesday, they were in for a rude shock. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere were 15 vehicles ahead of us and many more joined up behind us shortly later. After a point, the workers had to close the gates and ask approaching vehicles to go elsewhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ahmed said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy the time we completed the rites and returned home, it was 3.30am. In all, we spent almost 12 hours to cremate just one body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.Ahmed said the wait to cremate bodies is only increasing by the day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOne family took the body of a loved one to the Panathur crematorium and waited five hours. They then left and returned the next day at 6am to get the cremation done,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnother private ambulance I know of had gone to Sumanahalli crematorium at 12 noon and their turn came only at 11pm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ahmed said.Though each crematorium has two furnaces, Ahmed said technical issues cause even more delays. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCrematorium workers are overburdened, and I have seen their workload increase in the past few weeks. In fact, I had formed a bond with them in the past year. Lately, they are so busy that they are unable to receive or return my calls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.He said some people also pull strings and jump the queue, which only adds to the waiting time and the frustration of other bereaved families. Sadiq Hussain , another Mercy Angel volunteer, has helped with 400-500 cremations and burials in the past year. He said the long wait at crematoria is like rubbing salt on people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wounds. He says the reasons for the long queue are the increase in the number of deaths and pressure on crematoriums. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt takes a minimum of one hour, sometimes 90 minutes, to burn one body,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hussain said.It is not just the wait outside crematoria that is bothering bereaved family members. They also have to wait to find a vehicle to transport bodies from hospital to crematoria. Hussain said it is because of limited vehicles and an exponential number of deaths.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn addition, each vehicle is stuck at the crematorium for six to seven hours, creating an additional shortage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, adding that he witnessed a man searching for a vehicle to carry a body from 8am to 2pm near a hospital in the city.\u00e2\u0080\u009cEvery day I see people going through such immense pain and hassle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hussain said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom the lengthy procedure to release bodies at hospitals to massive queues at crematoria. What we do is service, but there needs to be some support and intervention from the government.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAhmed said one solution is to create temporary crematoria to take the load."},

The flash strike paralysed bus services across Karnataka as nearly 1.3 lakh STU staffers rallied behind Kodihalli Chandrashekar , president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha .A majority of the employees who were part of KSRTC Staff and Workers' Federation, which is affiliated to AITUC , joined the Chandrashekar-led Karnataka State Road Transport Employees' League. Buoyed by the December protest's response, the league issued a 21-day notice before the April strike seeking implementation of pay revision according to the 6th Pay Commission .However, the notice only gave the transport department ample time to be prepared. It roped in private bus operators and allowed them to run without permits across the state and also opened up government bus terminals to them. The government maintained implementation of the salary revision would translate into a 30% hike, which was not feasible, and offered an 8-10 per cent increase instead. However, it was not acceptable to the union leaders.Some employees alleged union leaders left them in the lurch. \"We should have at least agreed for a 10% hike, but now we are nowhere. They may take stringent action against us once we resume duty,\" rued a BMTC conductor.Transport department officials said they decided not to go for negotiations. \"This is probably for the first time in the history of STUs that an indefinite strike ended without negotiations. They haven't achieved anything. We decided not to succumb to pressure since they were too demanding and arrogant,\" said a senior transport department official.While employees' demand for salary revision was genuine, many felt a strike during a pandemic was untimely. \"We thought they would go for a 3-5-day strike but it lasted 15 days, the longest in the history of STUs in Karnataka. The government was ready to give at least an 8% hike, but they are unlikely to get it now,\" said the official.A union leader said the second Covid wave stumped them. \"We were not allowed to stage protests anywhere, including Freedom Park. Also, the government didn't give March salary to employees. It took action against workers. But we continued till the high court intervened in the matter on Tuesday,\" he added.STUs, meanwhile, gradually scaled up their operations as days passed. \"We have been improving our schedules despite protesters' threats. The strike had fizzled out even before they called it off. This is a setback for both STUs and employees. For the first time, Majestic bus terminuses saw so many private buses. It will also encourage the call for privatisation of transport services,\" said another official."},

With night curfew in place, highway patrol police are being deployed at entry and exit points in districts. At least half a dozen highway patrol vehicles monitor national and state highways round the clock. Their services are mostly restricted to checkposts during curfew hours, say police.\n\n\"Local police assist us but we have to scan vehicles entering and exiting the district,\" said a senior officer from Tumakuru district, adding: \"Since we are on the Bengaluru border, we get more vehicles entering and exiting the city. We have to check private vehicles in particular.\"\n\nFurther, patrolling vehicles in towns and rural areas in districts have been directed to set up checkposts on state highways. \"Since the education department has called off exams up to class 10, more families will be travelling to different parts of the state in private vehicles.

The state produced 154 lakh tonnes, an all-time record, as against 141 lakh tonnes in 2019-20. This is 30 per cent more than the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average food production of 115 lakh tonnes. Cereals accounted for 132 lakh tonnes and pulses the rest. Separately, the state recorded the highest production of oilseeds (13 lakh tonnes). This is mainly because there was a shortage of labour. Oilseeds don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require a lot of labour, which made them many farmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 preferred choice.How did Karnataka, which is prone to drought, floods and landslides, manage these numbers? \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of fairly widespread rainfall that covered around 65 per cent of the state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said state agriculture commissioner Brijesh Kumar Dikshit. He added that good rain in arid districts such as Tumakuru, Chitradurga , Chikkaballapur and Kolar also boosted food production.According to the state agriculture department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s data, farmers planted winter (rabi) crops on nearly 50 lakh hectares , which is nearly 30 per cent higher than normal. The total area of sowing during the kharif, rabi and summer seasons touched 116 lakh hectares, which increased the chances of a bumper harvest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHigher sowing during the rabi season was mainly on account of robust rains in October,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dikshit.The agriculture sector, which accounts for 50 per cent of the rural economy, was also able to shake off the impact of Covid-19 because of ample subsidised inputs such as fertilisers under the Atma Nirbhar package. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDuring the peak pandemic months last year, the farm sector was the only bright spot in the state economy. The pandemic didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect agricultural activities,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.A senior professor at the agriculture university in Bengaluru said that the farm sector turned out to be more resilient than the urban economy, mainly because of sufficient rain and reverse migration. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople returned to agriculture after losing their jobs in cities. Ample stocks helped keep a lid on food prices,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added."},

Call your parents, grandparents, friends. For Indians, the family is our support system. Rekindle those relationships. This will release a lot of serotonin (the happy chemical) in the face of all the gloom. If one is Covid-positive, you must do this. Don\u2019t talk, listen to your family speak.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fortunate to have the support of a wonderful clinical and administrative team who despite the tremendous pressures is still working with a smile. Be optimistic in your outlook and be assured that no pandemic lasts forever and this too shall pass and life will be back to normal sometime in the future.Always maintain a life-work balance and as far as possible make sure you stay healthy, have a good night\u2019s sleep and have some personal time whenever possible. I also strongly believe that we do our best but the rest is in God\u2019s hands and that has always been a source of strength for me.\u201dA female doctor working on the frontlines of a hospital says, \u201cAfter nine years in medical school, you\u2019re more or less trained for this. But most of us have hobbies that we indulge in to take our mind off stress. I write and paint and watchcontent. You have to be able to switch off from work after a point, sleep, do something different.\u201dWhile the first year seemed tough and most doctors somehow managed to get through it, they didn\u2019t expect the second year to be so challenging. Says\u201cOur patients have quadrupled in the last three weeks. We didn\u2019t expect to see a surge of this magnitude. There\u2019s been no time to ramp up facilities. We have no nurses.When we hear the politicians, the press and the public speak so disparagingly about us, that causes even more stress. We\u2019re doing our best. I would do yoga or meditation if my phone stopped ringing for a minute but it does not. I like to spend time with my family to destress. I had isolated myself from them for much of last year. I lost my father after a long illness (non-Covid) and I had to deal with that too. Nobody realises that doctors have families and lives. People don\u2019t like to meet doctors because they\u2019re scared. So we\u2019re socially isolated too. This is my third pandemic - I\u2019ve dealt with the HIV pandemic in the US, H1N1 and now Covid - but I\u2019ve not seen anything like this. \u201chis stress-buster in his golden retriever Simba. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to spend time with one\u2019s spouse and kids.

Amit and Bhavya were at Peenya crematorium around 6pm Wednesday. Six hours had elapsed in the queue and Prasad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was sixth in line.Hanumantha said he asked for Rs 6,000 and the family assumed it was Rs 60,000. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I was wearing a mask, they may have misheard. I asked for Rs 6,000 to ferry the body for five hours,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.A person working with an NGO ferrying patients to hospitals and bodies to crematoria said black marketeers are charging Rs 35,000 to transport a body from the hospital, provide a freezer for a night and take care of the last rites in the crematorium.Given the surge in Covid cases and deaths, the demand for ambulances has increased. Some ambulance drivers double as representatives for both crematorium workers and freezer providers and try to make a quick buck, the volunteer said on condition of anonymity."},

He learned that only two of the cheques were cleared and the remaining had bounced.\n\nKalidas said he has received the ?3 lakh compensation from the state government, but is yet to receive the ?2 lakh announced by the Centre.

I think that the impact actually may not be very large (on the economy),\" he said.Speaking at a webinar organised by the Financial Times and The Indian Express, he said \"all of us economists actually have to say all these things with enormous dose of humility, because not only in India but in every other country, predicting the pandemic has been extremely difficult.\"As far as second wave is concerned, he said there is a lot more knowledge about how to handle it and it is unlikely that India will go into a national lockdown as there have been a lot of learnings from the past.On the long-term prospects for the Indian economy, he said, growth should go back to 7 per cent-plus in a couple of years.This year actually will be an exceptional year because of the low base, he added.He also said public sector banks are in a much better shape compared to the past couple of years.\"There will be stress that is coming because when the real sector will get impacted because of the first wave and the second wave, but our banks are in a much better shape to handle it and the government remains actually committed behind them as well,\" he said."},

We need to continue to sustain the impulses of growth in the new financial year 2021-22,\" Das argued.The MPC, consisting of Das, Michael Debabrata Patra (RBI deputy governor), Mridul K Saggar (RBI executive director) and three external members -- Shashanka Bhide, Ashima Goyal and Jayanth R Varma -- had voted in favour of retaining the repo rate unchanged at 4 per cent.Patra said monetary policy has to remain supportive of the economy until the recovery is more sure footed and its sustainability assured.He noted that longer term inflation expectations remain broadly stable in spite of high volatility in food and fuel prices.\"Demand pull is still weak,\" he said, adding he would continue to look through the recent elevation in inflation and remain focused on reviving the economy on a path of strong and sustainable growth.\"An integral part of this approach would be to insulate domestic financial markets from global spillovers and volatility so that congenial financial conditions continue to support growth,\" he opined.Mridul K Saggar said it was equally important to understand that while increasing fiscal space to the extent possible is desirable, any revision in fiscal targets should be consistent with medium-term debt sustainability and should not impinge on conduct of monetary policy, such as requiring direct monetisation that has been eschewed even by countries with low inflation.According to him, the current account deficit in small size as expected is least of a worry, but going forward, with wide fiscal gaps, large twin deficits must be avoided over the medium term.\"While we had moved towards calibrated exit from extra-ordinary supportive measures to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 as the curve was flattening, we have already made considerable adjustments in exit dates for these measures.\"The extant priority is now to continue supporting growth from the possible shock from the second wave,\" he said, while voiting for retaining the policy rate and continue with the accommodative stance.Quoting Marie Curie, he said, \"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.\"Jayanth R Varma said the economic recovery after the pandemic shock of 2020 remains uneven and incomplete, and the renewed jump in Covid-19 infections in certain parts of the country has increased the downside risk to the growth momentum.On the other hand, inflation rates have been consistently well above the mid point of the target zone and is forecast to remain elevated for some time.\"This is a difficult situation, but I believe that the balance of risk and reward is in favour of monetary accommodation,\" he said.As per the minutes, Ashima Goyal said India's cautious approach to capital account convertibility means that volatile fixed income flows are still capped at 6 per cent of outstanding stocks of G-Secs.Large foreign exchange (FX) reserves, acquired during surges in inflows, are sufficient to counter outflows due to rising US G-Sec rates without having to raise domestic rates, Goyal said, and added sale of FX stocks will release space on the RBI's balance sheet to buy more Indian government securities consistent with its target for creation of durable liquidity.Shashanka Bhide said expansion of supply of goods and services in public and private spheres will require new investments and access to funds.The monetary policy environment so far has provided support to sustaining economic activities and recovery of growth, Bhide said, while adding that such policy environment is needed to strengthen and broaden the ongoing recovery process.The next meeting of the MPC is scheduled during June 2-4."},

In 2006, it listed its Indian assets on the BSE.\n\nFive years after that, the government passed a retroactive tax law and billed Cairn Rs 10,247 crore plus interest and penalty for the reorganisation tied to the flotation.\n\nThe state then expropriated and liquidated Cairn's remaining shares in the Indian entity, seized dividends and withheld tax refunds to recover a part of the demand.\n\nCairn challenged the move before an arbitration tribunal in The Hague, which in December awarded it $1.2 billion (over Rs 8,800 crore) plus costs and interest, which totals $1.725 billion (Rs 12,600 crore) as of December 2020.\n\nThe company has since then been in talks with the finance ministry to get the government to pay the award.\n\nIts officials held three face-to-face meetings with the then revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey in February and at least one video call with his successor Tarun Bajaj.\n\nPTI had previously reported that the company had in the meetings offered to forego USD 500 million out of the $1.7 billion award and invest that amount in any oil and gas or renewable energy project identified by the Centre after rejecting a government offer to get paid just one-fourth of the award.\n\nIt wants the principal of $1.2 billion to be paid and is open to re-investing the interest and cost in India.\n\nThe Indian government, which appointed one of the three arbitrators on The Hague panel and fully participated in the arbitration proceedings since 2015, wanted Cairn to settle the issue through its now-closed tax dispute resolution scheme, Vivad se Vishwas.\n\nVivad se Vishwas scheme, which closed on March 31, provided for dropping of tax case if 50 per cent of the demand was paid, which the company rejected, sources said.\n\nEven if it were to have agreed to the scheme, the Indian government had to refund about Rs 2,500 crore to the British firm, they said, adding the value of shares seized and sold, dividend confiscated and tax refund withheld totalled to over Rs 7,600 crore, which was more than 50 per cent of the Rs 10,247 crore principal tax demand raised.\n\nCairn, which is of the opinion that the unanimous ruling of the tribunal was enforceable against Indian-owned assets in more than 160 countries that have signed and ratified the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, has hired asset-tracing firms to investigate the overseas assets that could be seized to recover the amount due.\n\nCairn has already taken steps to have the arbitration award recognised in nine major jurisdictions such as the US, UK, France, the Netherlands, Singapore and Canada's Quebec province, where Indian sovereign assets have been identified.\n\nIt has not said what it might go after but assets could include Air India's planes, vessels belonging to the Shipping Corporation of India and property owned by state banks.\n\n"},

Realtors warned that expensive homes could become a permanent feature of the market, worsening inequality.\n\nEven as the economy is booming and the labor market scars are healing thanks to massive public aid from the government and increased Covid-19 vaccinations, there are still 17.4 million people collecting unemployment checks.\n\n\"We are seeing claims drop across most states, which shows the jobs recovery has become more geographically broad-based,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.\n\n\"However, a growing number of Americans are out of work for longer, and it's those who are tougher to bring back into the labor force.\"\n\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 39,000 to a seasonally adjusted 547,000 for the week ended April 17, the lowest since mid-March 2020, the labor department said.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast 617,000 applications for the latest week.\n\nIt was the second straight week that claims were below the 700,000 level since March 2020 when mandatory shutdowns of non-essential businesses like restaurants and bars were enforced to slow the first wave of Covid-19 infections.\n\nThere were large declines in filings in Texas and New York, as well as decreases in several other states.\n\nClaims have remained elevated because of fraud, especially in California and Ohio. The enhancement of the unemployment benefits programs, including a weekly $300 subsidy, could also be encouraging some people to attempt to file a claim for assistance, though not every application is approved.\n\nThe latest labor department data on first payments show only a fraction of claims were successful over the past months.\n\nThe weekly subsidy and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program will run through September 6. Claims jumped to a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.\n\nIncluding the PUA program, 699,798 people filed claims last week, squeaking below 700,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\n\nStocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.\n\nBroad improvement\n\nThe United States has expanded Covid-19 vaccination eligibility to most American adults, and more than half that population has had at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A third of US adults are fully vaccinated, as well as 26% of the population overall, it said.\n\nThat, together with the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, has allowed for broader economic re-engagement. The resulting surge in demand has left businesses scrambling for workers. Retail sales raced to a record high in March and factories are humming.\n\nLast week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. First-time filings have dropped from 765,000 in mid-March, boosting hopes for strong employment gains in April.\n\nThe economy created 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months. Employment, however, remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.\n\n\"Job growth in the spring of 2021 is receiving a boost as better weather allows for more outdoor activity,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Job growth will remain very strong throughout 2021 and into 2022 thanks to vaccination efforts and stimulus payments that are supporting consumer spending.\"\n\nBut the housing market is backpedaling. Existing home sales dropped 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.01 million units last month, the lowest level since August 2020, the National Association of Realtors said in a separate report on Thursday.\n\nThe plunge reflected a supply squeeze, which boosted the median house price a record 17.2% from a year ago to an all-time high of $329,100.\n\nSales are skewed towards large and more expensive homes. The NAR reported intense bidding wars, which it said could lead to discrimination against some buyers.\n\n\"Without an increase in supply, the society wealth division will widen with homeowners enjoying sizable equity gains while renters will struggle to become homeowners,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR.\n\nStill, housing remains supported by the recovering labor market. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 34,000 to 3.674 million in the week ended April 10.\n\nThe so-called continuing claims have declined from 23.1 million at the height of the crisis. Part of the drop is likely because of people finding work and exhausting their eligibility for benefits, which is limited to 26 weeks in most states.\n\nAbout 5.6 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended April 3. Another 492,999 were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid. There were 17.405 million people receiving benefits under all programs in early April.\n\n"},

Brian Kemp on Wednesday announced that he had appointed the Rev. Abraham Mosley to serve as chairman of the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, the state authority responsible for overseeing Stone Mountain Park about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta. The park is a popular hiking and tourist site but is replete with Confederate imagery.\n\nMosley, pastor of Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Athens, Georgia, was previously a member of the association's board. His elevation to chairman comes as the park's Confederate symbols face renewed opposition, with some calling on park leaders to stop maintaining its signature feature - a colossal sculpture of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson that is carved into the mountain's northern face.\n\nAssociation CEO Bill Stephens told WSB-TV the board will hear ideas at a meeting on Monday about how to change the park in ways he thinks will balance its historical record.\n\nMosley urged patience.\n\n\"Certainly, there are mounting problems that have been brought before us. But we've got to handle them one at a time,\" he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nKemp said in a statement that he was confident Mosley would \"continue to rely on his experience in bringing people together\" as chairman of the association.\n\nThe Stone Mountain Action Coalition, an advocacy group, last year proposed that the association remove Confederate flags at the base of the mountain, change the names of streets and other park features with Confederate affiliations and refocus the park on themes such as racial reconciliation and justice. Meymoona Freeman, a leader of the group, said it wanted to see the carving of Lee, Davis and Jackson transformed into a natural space. The sculpture has special protection enshrined in Georgia law, which calls on the Stone Mountain Memorial Association to protect the site as a \"Confederate Memorial and public recreation area,\" according to the association's website.\n\nThe Stone Mountain Action Coalition said in a statement it was \"encouraged\" by Mosley's appointment.\n\n\"It is our hope that the appointment of Reverend Mosley to this position of leadership is the first of many changes at this public park that will result in the immediate and complete removal of symbols, monuments, flags, street, place and building names, events and activities that honor and celebrate the Confederacy and the Ku Klux Klan,\" the Stone Mountain Action Coalition said in a statement.\n\n"},

Read More\n\nKABUL: The US military has begun shipping equipment and winding down contracts with local service providers ahead of the May 1 start of the final phase of its military pullout from Afghanistan , a US Defense Department official said Thursday.\n\nThe pullout under US President Joe Biden marks the end of America's longest war after a 20-year military engagement. Currently, some 2,500 US soldiers and about 7,000 allied forces are still in Afghanistan.\n\nIn February last year, the US military began closing its smaller bases. In mid-April, the Biden administration announced that the final phase of the withdrawal would begin May 1 and be completed before Sept. 11.\n\nSince then, the military has been shipping equipment and winding down local contracts for services such as trash pickup and maintenance work, the US official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations.\n\nWhile preparations are under way, troops likely won't begin to depart for a few weeks, he said, adding that \"we won't see a coming down of the (troop) numbers\" until remaining bases close.\n\nThere have been indications that the pullout could be completed well before Sept. 11, which marks the 20th anniversary of the al-Qaida terror attack on the U.S. and the trigger for the US invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nOn Wednesday, Germany's Defense Ministry said discussions are underway among military planners with the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Kabul for a possible withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan as early as July 4.\n\nIn the short term, America will likely increase its troop presence in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said last Friday. The additional troops would be in Afghanistan over the coming weeks and months to help with what the herculean task of wrapping up 20 years of war.\n\nWhile much of the equipment headed back to the US will be shipped by air, the military will also use land routes through Pakistan and north through Central Asia, the Defense Department official said.\n\nThe U.S. equipment that is neither shipped back to America nor given to the Afghan National Security forces will be sold to contractors, who will, in turn, sell it in the local markets.\n\n\"You'll most likely start seeing it eventually showing up in bazaars as scrap,\" said the official.\n\nThe Taliban, meanwhile, were non-committal when asked by the AP whether the insurgents would attack departing US and NATO troops. \"It's too early for these issues, nothing can be said about the future,\" said Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem.\n\nIn a deal the Taliban signed last year with former President Donald Trump , the final US withdrawal deadline was set as May 1. Under the agreement, the Taliban promised not to attack US and NATO troops but they also later promised \"consequences\" if Washington defied the May 1 deadline.\n\n"},

Read More\n\nWASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Thursday pledged to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 52 per cent by the end of this decade. With this, Biden reverses the hands-off policy of his isolationist and science-sceptic predecessor Donald Trump , restoring a global approach in an interdependent world in the throes of a pandemic.\n\nForty world leaders -- including heads from China, India, Russia, Japan, and UK -- pitched their views and ideas at a virtual summit where Biden, introduced by his vice-president Kamala Harris, called the need for addressing global warming \"a moral imperative, an economic imperative.\"\n\n\"The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. The cost of inaction is mounting,\" he said in his opening remarks, vowing that US would do its part to cut its 2005 level emissions by 50 to 52 per cent by 2030. He further asserted that his approach will create jobs and boost economies.\n\nThe White House said the US President's goal roughly doubles a target set by President Barack Obama in 2015 as part of the Paris climate accord, and he plans to formalise the new goal in a submission to the United Nations.\n\nBiden's pledge will require a fundamental change in the \"American way of life\" cherished by the country's nativist base, premised on unsparing and uncaring use of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons. A $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan which includes a clean energy standard to achieve net zero emissions in the power sector by 2035 and money to electrify the vehicle fleet are among the steps the Biden administration had proposed. The plan triggered resentment in mostly Trumpian circle of climate change sceptics which believes Washington should not worry about the rest of the world and simply do what is best for the American economy that thrives on consumption.\n\nIllustrative of the common global concern on the issue despite severe differences on other matters, leaders of Russia, China, India, Japan, Canada, UK and others -- many with serious on-going bilateral spats -- joined the virtual summit to broadly align themselves with the overall goal of reducing emissions.\n\nBiden, who spoke from the East Room of the White House decorated with plants and greenery on the occasion of Earth Day , was later joined by Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and climate czar John Kerry as Washington returned to a leadership role to tackle a global crisis that has momentarily taken a backseat due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand all of us, all of us and particularly those of us who represent the world's largest economies. We have to step up,\" he said in words that could well apply to the pandemic.\n\nIn his speech, Prime Minister Modi made no new commitments but announced an India-US climate and clean energy partnership to mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies, and enable green collaborations. He also maintained that India's per capita emissions are far smaller than other major emitters -- a pointed rebuttal to global powers often putting China, which has five times more emissions than India, in the same basket.\n\n"},

Shehbaz's counsel told the court since no investigation was pending against his client in these cases as the NAB had already filed a case against him, he should be granted bail.\n\nShehbaz is accused of beneficiary of assets held in the name of his family members and benamidars who had no sources to acquire such assets. NAB says, \"Shehbaz and other suspects committed offences of corruption and corrupt practices as envisaged under the provisions of the National Accountability Ordinance 1999 and money laundering as delineated in the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2010.\"\n\nA total of 20 people had been nominated in the case. The other main suspects are Shehbaz's wife Nusrat, his sons Hamza (leader of opposition in Punjab assembly) and Suleman (who is absconding in the UK), and his daughters Rabia Imran and Javeria Ali.\n\nShehbaz's elder brother Nawaz Sharif has been in London since November 2019 on 'medical grounds'. The Imran Khan government has declared Sharif an absconder and cancelled his passport.\n\nNawaz left the country after the court granted him bail in the Al-Azizia Mills corruption case in which he was undergoing seven years imprisonment in Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore. He was also granted four-week bail on medical grounds to have his treatment abroad. The government declared him an absconder after he failed to justify prolonging his stay in London.\n\n"},

The India-UK relationship could play a significant role in the containment of these practices,\" it states. \"The potential for the UK to use the ETP, and even the launch of FTA negotiations to lock the Indian government into a broader coalition of willing partners could be a game-changer for the Indo-Pacific region.\"\n\nThe UK, India and the existing CPTPP countries constitute around half of the global economy.\n\n\"Many countries have sought to do a trade deal with India, but these have proved notoriously difficult to close. It is possible that the UK has the key to unlock the Indian puzzle,\" Singham writes.\n\nHe states an FTA would have commercial benefits to both countries. The UK would like to see Scotch whisky tariffs reduced and greater access for UK financial, legal and professional services in India. India wants the UK to be more accommodating of business and student visas, in particular for IT executives. If the UK lowers its tariff schedule further below the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Common External Tariff and diverges from EU bans on products, then Indian agriculture could substantially benefit too, it adds.\n\nBut the report warns that FTAs are \"irrelevant if the rule of law and contracts are flouted, or if anticompetitive market distortions are the order of the day\".\n\nCiting the cases of Vodafone, Cairn Energy and Devas Multimedia Pvt Ltd, the report raises concerns that the Indian government is \"systematically breaking bilateral investment treaties (BITs), ignoring court and arbitration rulings, cancelling contracts, expropriating private property and using state institutions to prosecute the very parties whose rights they should be protecting\".\n\nSingham urges Johnson in his talks with Modi to push the Indian government to recognise and respect its existing commitments under bilateral investment treaties.\n\n\"Future British investors in India will expect the Indian government to abide by the BIT, including arbitration judgments. If this cannot be certain, then why would any investor feel confident about the provisions of a future FTA?\" the report asks.\n\n"},

You. Those who came out. Those who didn't come out but supported it. Those who didn't support it publicly, but sympathized,\" Navalny said in an Instagram post.\n\nThe 44-year-old, who is in his fourth week of hunger strike, said he hadn't known \"what was really happening\" because he only has access to one TV channel in prison, but his lawyer visited him on Thursday and got him up to speed about the events on Wednesday. \"And, I will sincerely say, two feelings are raging inside me: pride and hope.\"\n\n\"People are marching in the street. It means they know and understand everything,\" said Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin 's most prominent opponent. \"They won't give up their future, the future of their children, their country. Yes, it will be difficult and dark for some time. But those pulling Russia back historically are doomed. There are more of us in any case. Russia will be happy.\"\n\nMass street protests in support of Navalny swept dozens of cities and smaller towns across Russia on Wednesday night. The largest crowds were seen in Moscow, where thousands marched down the city center amid a heavy police presence.\n\nUnlike on past occasions, officers in riot gear didn't interfere with the rally in the Russian capital, allowing quickly growing crowds to swarm streets and squares for several hours. According to OVD-Info, a rights group that monitors political arrests and offers legal aid, police detained only 31 people in Moscow, which usually accounts for the vast majority of arrests across the country.\n\nBut overall, OVD-Info tallied more than 1,900 arrests across the country on Wednesday night, with more than 800 occurring in St. Petersburg.\n\nIt was unclear whether the demonstrations matched the size and intensity of the nationwide protests that broke out in January after Navalny was arrested.\n\nLeonid Volkov, Navalny's top strategist and chief of staff, maintained in the YouTube live stream about the protests that Wednesday's turnout exceeded January's, while the number of arrests was several times lower.\n\nIndependent political analyst and former Kremlin speechwriter Abbas Gallyamov believes the turnout on Wednesday was somewhat comparable to that in January, indicating that the harsh crackdown that followed previous demonstrations hasn't scared off Navalny's supporters.\n\nHundreds of people were jailed in the aftermath of the January demonstrations, and a number of Navalny allies were slapped with criminal charges for allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions.\n\n\"In recent months, the authorities have made very serious attempts to (discourage protests) by tightening the screws, and many - including me - had serious concerns that much fewer people would turn up,\" Gallyamov told The Associated Press Thursday.\n\nNavalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin - accusations Russian officials reject.\n\nSoon after, a court found that the politician's stay in Germany violated the terms of his suspended sentence for a 2014 embezzlement conviction, and ordered him to serve 2 1/2 years in prison.\n\nNavalny began the hunger strike to protest prison authorities' refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and numbness in his legs. Officials insisted Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs.\n\nNavalny's doctors said last week that the politician's test results showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys. He \"could die at any moment,\" his physician Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin said in a Facebook post.\n\nNavalny's allies had called the Wednesday protest in light of the alarming news, saying his life was at stake.\n\n"},

Read More\n\nJERUSALEM: A Syrian anti-aircraft missile landed in southern Israel early Thursday, setting off air raid sirens near the country's top-secret nuclear reactor, the Israeli military said. In response, it said it attacked the missile launcher and air-defense systems in neighboring Syria.\n\nIsraeli media later described the Syrian missile as an \"errant\" projectile, not a deliberate attack deep inside Israel. In recent years, Israel has repeatedly launched air strikes at Syria, including at military targets linked to foes Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, both allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Such strikes routinely draw Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Thursday's exchange was unusual because the Syrian projectile landed deep inside Israel.\n\nSyria's state news agency SANA said the exchange began with an Israeli air strike on Dumeir, a suburb of the capital of Damascus . Dumeir is believed to house Syrian army installations and batteries as well as bases and weapons depots belonging to Iran-backed militias. SANA said four soldiers were wounded.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , an opposition war monitoring group based in Britain that tracks Syria's civil war, said the Israeli strikes hit an air defense base belonging to the Syrian military and destroyed air defense batteries in the area. It said the Syrian military fired surface-to-air missiles in response.\n\nSyrian media made no mention of an anti-aircraft missile landing deep inside Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military described the projectile that landed near the nuclear site as a surface-to-air missile, which is usually used for air defense against warplanes or other missiles. That could suggest the Syrian missile had targeted Israeli warplanes but missed and flew off errantly. However, Dimona, the Negev desert town where Israel's nuclear reactor is located, is some 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Damascus, a long range for an errantly fired surface-to-air missile.\n\nThe Israeli army said it had deployed a missile defense system to intercept the projectile and that there had been no damage. The Israeli military later said in a statement that an initial investigation indicated that the Syrian missile was not intercepted.\n\nThe air raid sirens were sounded in Abu Krinat, a village just a few kilometers (miles) from Dimona. Explosions heard across Israel might have been the air-defense systems.\n\nApparent missile fragments were found in a swimming pool in Ashalim, a community approximately 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Dimona. Israeli troops arrived at the scene and collected the fragments.\n\nThe military said that in response to the incoming missile, it launched an air strike at the battery that launched the anti-aircraft missile and other surface-to-air batteries in Syria.\n\nThe exchange between Israel and Syria comes against the backdrop of growing tensions between Israel and Iran, a key ally of Syria. Iran, which maintains troops and proxies in Syria, has accused Israel of a series of attacks on its nuclear facilities, including sabotage at its Natanz nuclear facility on April 11, and vowed revenge. It also threatened to complicate U.S.-led attempts to revive the international nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n"},

Economic pressure, coupled with the growing uncertainty over when vaccines will be widely available in the Islamic Republic, have many simply giving up on social distancing, considering it an unaffordable luxury. That has public health officials worried the worst of the pandemic still may be yet to come.\"I cannot stop working,\" said Mostafa Shahni, a worried 34-year-old construction worker in Tehran. \"If I do, I can't bring home bread for my wife and two kids.\"Iran is now reporting its highest-ever new coronavirus case numbers - more than 25,000 a day. Its daily death toll has surged to around 400, still below the grim record of 486 it reached in November.During the peak of Iran's last surge, around 20,000 coronavirus patients were hospitalized across the country. Today, that figure has topped 40,000. The health ministry warns the number will climb to 60,000 in the coming weeks. Iran remains among the hardest-hit countries in the world and the worst-hit in the Middle East.Across Tehran, Associated Press journalists have seen signs of the pandemic's toll.At Tehran's Shohadaye Tajrish Hospital, orderlies pushed the bodies of two victims of the coronavirus across a parking lot to its morgue, one wrapped in white, the other in a black body bag. All of its wards on five floors of the hospital are reserved for coronavirus patients. One empty gurney held a bouquet of roses left for a recently deceased man. A heart-shaped balloon hovered over a still respirator.At the massive Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, already reeling from the pandemic, workers laid cinder-block rows of new graves. Mourners in black wept at a stream of funerals. Officials plan to open a new morgue at the site to handle the wave of death, much wrought by what Iranians simply call \"corona.\"Saeed Khal, the director of Tehran's main cemetery, said workers buried 350 bodies there on Tuesday alone - at least 150 had died of coronavirus. The cemetery had never processed that many burials in a single day, not even during Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s that saw 1 million people killed.It was \"one of the hardest and saddest days for my colleagues in the half-century-history of the cemetery,\" Khal told state TV.So much is the influx that some burials are being delayed by a day, unusual for Iran which follows the Islamic practice of immediately burying the dead.Outside the gates of Tehran's Imam Khomeini Hospital complex, where the capital's poor can receive free treatment at its 1,300 beds, scores crowded around one recent day as guards turned away routine cases and allowed in only test-confirmed coronavirus cases.\"They say the wards are full of corona patients,\" said Manijeh Taheri, who sought a regular thyroid treatment for her mother at the hospital. \"I have no idea where to take her when such a huge complex has no place for my mother.\"Field hospitals are being prepared in Tehran and other major cities. State TV has shown images at hospitals outside the capital with patients being treated in hallways.\"We are not going out of the red zone any time soon,\" Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi told state media.President Hassan Rouhani blames the current surge on the fast-spreading variant of the virus first found in Britain, which the government says arrived from neighboring Iraq. Travel between the countries has been restricted since March, though people and commerce continue to cross each day. Overall, Iran has seen 2.2 million reported cases and 67,000 deaths in total.Lawmaker Jalil Rahimi Jahanabadi blamed government mismanagement and continued US sanctions for the virus' spread.\"Sanctions, challenges and wrong decisions will continue. We do not have sufficient vaccines so protect yourself and your relatives through personal health measures,\" he wrote on Twitter.As of now, Iran has administered over 500,000 vaccine doses, according to the WHO. Supplies, however, remain limited. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has banned US and British-made coronavirus vaccines, saying their import is \"forbidden\" because he does not trust those nations. Khamenei has approved the import of vaccines from \"safe\" countries, such as China and Russia, and has backed national efforts to produce a homegrown vaccine with help from Cuba.But officials keep changing when they say the wider public will be vaccinated as it remains unclear when Tehran will have a promised 60 million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine.Amir Afkhami, an associate professor at George Washington University, said that over the past year, Iran's leadership could point to superpowers like the U.S. struggling to contain the virus. With vaccines rolled out in the West and economies reopening, this could become much more difficult to do, he said.\"Ultimately Iran is not self-sufficient when it comes to Covid-19 vaccine development, and it doesn't have the (intensive care unit) beds to absorb the patients it needs to so it really needs external help,\" Afkhami said.Authorities across Iran have closed mosques, restaurants and parks during Ramadan, the Islamic holy fasting month being observed by Muslims around the world. An evening curfew for private cars is in place and travel between cities is banned. Parliament has been suspended for two weeks.But the wider fatigue from the virus has seen people ignore warnings and host fast-breaking meals known as iftars indoors. Already, authorities blamed celebrations around the Iranian New Year known as Nowruz in March for contributing to this wave.Masoud Mardani, an infectious disease specialist on Iran's Covid-19 national task force, has demanded a public curfew. But none so far has come."},

He said the vaccine will be given first to frontline workers, the elderly and those with chronic diseases.Akjemal Magtymova, the representative of the World Health Organization in Syria, said that the government drafted a plan with the WHO and UN children's agency UNICEF to distribute the vaccine equally across the country.Thursday's announcement came a day after Syria's last rebel-held enclave received its first batch of 53,800 Covid-19 vaccines, brought in from neighboring Turkey.The 203,000 jabs that arrived in Damascus will cover government-held areas and those under the control of Kurdish fighters in the northeast. Hundreds of thousands more are scheduled to arrive in the coming months.\"The priority for immunization will be frontline health workers who are the first line of defense against COVID ,\" said Ted Chaiban, regional director for the Middle East and north Africa at UNICEF. Speaking with The Associated Press from neighboring Jordan, Chaiban added that after health workers, older people will be vaccinated.The Syrian government has registered over 21,500 cases - including 1,483 deaths - in areas under its control since the first case was reported in March 2020. Over 21,000 infections and over 640 deaths have been recorded in rebel-held northwestern Syria, while the Kurdish areas in the northeast registered 14,400 cases including 477 deaths.Officials in government-controlled areas had already rolled out limited vaccinations following an announcement by Damascus in February that it received an undetermined amount of vaccine from an unnamed friendly country.Separately, the United Arab Emirates said it sent a shipment of Covid-19 vaccine doses that arrived Tuesday in Damascus to help Syria fight the pandemic. It didn't say how many doses or which vaccine.The WHO had said the vaccination campaign in Syria was expected to start in April. It aims to inoculate 20% of the population by the end of 2021."},

Read More\n\nJAKARTA: Indonesia's navy ships are intensely searching the waters where one of its submarines was last detected before it disappeared with 53 people on board, as neighboring countries are set to join the complex operation.\n\nThe KRI Nanggala 402 was participating in a training exercise Wednesday when it missed a scheduled reporting call. Officials reported an oil slick and the smell of diesel fuel near the starting position of its last dive, about 96 kilometers (60 miles) north of the resort island of Bali .\n\nIndonesia's military said that five navy ships and a helicopter were taking part in the search while a hydro-oceanographic survey ship equipped with underwater detection capabilities is on its way to the site around the oil spills. Officials said they had not yet been linked to the missing submarine.\n\nRescue ships from Singapore and Malaysia are expected to arrive Saturday. The military said Australia, the United States , Germany, France, Australia, Russia, India and Turkey have also offered assistance.\n\nSome worry that the area may be too deep to locate or retrieve the ship, suggesting potential challenges facing the search operation.\n\n\"There looks like a terrible tragedy and it's in a very deep part of waters, 700 or 800 meters (2,297 feet or 2,625 feet) deep potentially,\" Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton told Sydney Radio 2GB .\n\n\"It makes it very difficult for the recovery or for location. But there's some assistance that potentially we can apply and the Chief of the Defense Force (Angus Campbell) obviously reached out to his counterpart to say whatever Australia can provide, we will,\" he said.\n\nThe submarine was carrying 49 crew members, its commander and three gunners, the Indonesian Defense Ministry said.\n\nThe navy said an electrical failure may have occurred during the dive, causing the submarine to lose control and become unable to undertake emergency procedures that would have allowed it to resurface. It said it believes the submarine sank to a depth of 600-700 meters (2,000-2,300 feet).\n\nThe German-built submarine, which has been in service in Indonesia since 1981, was rehearsing for a missile-firing exercise that was to take place on Thursday. Military chief Hadi Tjahjanto and other military leaders were to attend.\n\nIndonesia currently has a fleet of five submarines and plans to operate at least eight by 2024.\n\nThe world's largest archipelago nation with more than 17,000 islands has faced growing challenges to its maritime claims in recent years, including numerous incidents involving Chinese vessels near the Natuna islands.\n\nLast year, president Joko widodo reaffirmed the country's sovereignty during a visit to the islands at the edge of the South China Sea , one of the busiest sea lanes where China is embroiled in territorial disputes with its smaller neighbors.\n\nHis visit came a week after Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang insisted that Chinese fishermen are free to conduct activities in areas China claims as its traditional fishing grounds, which partly overlap Indonesia's exclusive economic zone.\n\nGeng's statement drew indignation in Indonesia and prompted the military to increase its forces at the islands. Although China has been making such claims for years, recently dozens of Chinese fishing boats, escorted by coast guard vessels, have reportedly made more aggressive moves in the area and ignored Indonesian warnings to leave.\n\n"},

(AP)\n\nCANBERRA: Australia has cancelled two Chinese \"Belt and Road'' infrastructure building initiative deals with a state government, provoking an angry response from Beijing.\n\nThe bilateral deals with Victoria state were among four vetoed under new laws that give the federal government power to overrule international agreements by lower-level administrations that violate the national interest, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said late Wednesday.\n\nThe \"Belt and Road'' deals struck with Beijing in 2018 and 2019 triggered the legislative response.\n\nVictoria Education Department pacts signed with Syria in 1999 and Iran in 2004 were also canceled.\n\n\"I consider these four arrangements to be inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adverse to our foreign relations,'' Payne said.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Australia said in a statement the decision \"further shows that the Australian government has no sincerity in improving China-Australia relations.''\n\n\"It is bound to bring further damage to bilateral relations, and will only end up hurting itself,'' the embassy said on Thursday, referring to the Australian government.\n\nThe Global Times , a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party , said in a headline: \"Australia faces serious consequences for unreasonable provocation against China.''\n\nThe move \"marks a significant escalation that could push icy bilateral relations into an abyss,'' the newspaper added.\n\nAustralia's bilateral relations with its most important trading partner are at their lowest point in decades. Chinese government ministers refuse to take phone calls from their Australian counterparts, and trade disruptions are widely seen as China imposing economic punishment.\n\nBut Payne said Thursday she did not expect China to retaliate.\n\n\"Australia is operating in our national interests. We are very careful and very considered in that approach.'' Payne said.\n\n\"It's about ensuring that we have a consistent approach to foreign policy across all levels of government, and it isn't about any one country,'' she said. \"It is most certainly not intended to harm Australia's relationships with any countries.''\n\nVictoria's center-left Labor Party government said the Foreign Relations Act, under which the deals were cancelled, was a matter for the federal government.\n\n\"The Victorian government will continue to work hard to deliver jobs, trade and economic opportunities for our state,'' the statement said.\n\nVictoria's opposition leader Michael O'Brien, who vowed to scrap the deals if he won elections next year, welcomed the federal government's decision.\n\nO'Brien, who belongs to the same conservative Liberal Party as the foreign minister, said the Victorian government had \"given away major infrastructure contracts to Chinese-owned companies'' under one deal.\n\n\"In return, the Chinese government has smashed our farmers with tariffs on barley. They have smashed our wine exporters with trade sanctions,'' O'Brien told Melbourne Radio 3AW.\n\nObservers have described the Victorian deals as vague and non-binding. Some suspect their value to the Chinese Communist Party was to exploit differences in opinion in Australia over \"Belt and Road'' deals, which critics argue can create debt traps for poor countries.\n\nAustralian Defense Minister Peter Dutton said his government would not allow the Chinese Communist Party to use such deals with Australian states as \"propaganda.''\n\n\"Our problem is with the values or the virtues or the outlook of the Chinese Communist Party ,'' Dutton told Sydney Radio 2GB.\n\nThe party had militarized ports in the Asia-Pacific region and Australian security agencies had reported an increased level of foreign interference across the region, Dutton said.\n\n\"We're worried about cyberattacks and we're worried obviously about state governments that enter into compacts with the Communist Party against our national interests,'' Dutton said.\n\n\"We can't allow these sort of compacts, these sort of arrangements and friendships to pop up because they're used for propaganda reasons and we're just not going to allow that to happen,'' he added.\n\n"},

Read More\n\nMOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday sternly warned the West against encroaching further on Russia's security interests, saying Moscow's response will be ``quick and tough'' and make the culprits bitterly sorry for their action.\n\nThe warning during Putin's annual state-of-the-nation address came amid a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine, where cease-fire violations in the seven-year conflict between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have escalated in recent weeks. The United States and its allies have urged the Kremlin to pull the troops back.\n\n``I hope that no one dares to cross the red line in respect to Russia, and we will determine where it is in each specific case,'' Putin said. ``Those who organize any provocations threatening our core security interests will regret their deeds more than they regretted anything for a long time.''\n\nMoscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the troop buildup, saying it doesn't threaten anyone and that Russia is free to deploy its forces on its territory. But the Kremlin also has warned Ukraine against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel-held east, saying Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region.\n\n``We really don't want to burn the bridges,'' Putin said. ``But if some mistake our good intentions for indifference or weakness and intend to burn or even blow up those bridges themselves, Russia's response will be asymmetrical, quick and tough.''\n\nAs Putin spoke, a wave of protests started rolling across Russia in support of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny , and a human rights group said over 1,000 people were arrested. Thousands marched in central Moscow, where police blocked off a square next to the Kremlin. Police in St. Petersburg blocked off Palace Square, outside the Hermitage museum, and protesters instead massed along Nevsky Prospekt.\n\nThe politician, who is Putin's most persistent critic and was poisoned with a chemical nerve agent last year, started a hunger strike three weeks ago to protest what he said was inadequate medical treatment and officials' refusal to allow his doctor to visit him. His supporters called the rallies as his health reportedly is in severe decline.\n\nIn his speech, Putin pointed to Russia's moves to modernize its nuclear arsenal and said the military would continue to build more state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles and other new weapons. He added that the development of the nuclear-armed Poseidon underwater drone and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile is continuing successfully.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the US and its allies, the Russian leader denounced those who impose ``unlawful, politically motivated economic sanctions and crude attempts to enforce its will on others.'' He said Russia has shown restraint and often refrained from responding to ``openly boorish'' actions by others.\n\nThe Biden administration last week imposed new sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2020 US presidential election and for involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies _ activities Moscow has denied. The US ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and individuals, and imposed new curbs on Russia's ability to borrow money.\n\nRussia retaliated by ordering 10 US diplomats to leave, blacklisting eight current and former US officials, and tightening requirements for US Embassy operations.\n\n``Russia has its own interests, which we will defend in line with the international law,'' Putin said during Wednesday's address. ``If somebody refuses to understand this obvious thing, is reluctant to conduct a dialogue and chooses a selfish and arrogant tone, Russia will always find a way to defend its position.''\n\nIn an emotional outburst, Putin chastised the West for acquiring a defiant stance toward Russia.\n\n``Some countries have developed a nasty habit of bullying Russia for any reason or without any reason at all. It has become a new sport,'' he said.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the US allies, he compared them to Tabaqui, a cowardly golden jackal kowtowing to Shere Khan, the tiger in Rudyard Kipling's ``Jungle Book.'' ``They howl to please their lord,'' he said.\n\nRussia this week engaged in a tense tug-of-war with the Czech Republic, following Prague's move to expel 18 Russian diplomats over a massive Czech ammunition depot explosion in 2014. Moscow has dismissed the Czech accusations of its involvement in the blast as absurd and retaliated by expelling 20 Czech diplomats.\n\nPutin also harshly criticized the West for failing to condemn what he described as a botched coup attempt and a failed plot to assassinate Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko , allegedly involving a blockade of the country's capital, power cuts and cyberattacks. Belarusian and Russian security agencies arrested the alleged coup plotters in Moscow earlier this month.\n\n``The practice of organizing coups and planning political assassinations of top officials goes over the top and crosses all boundaries,'' Putin said, drawing parallels to plots against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the popular protests that led to the ouster of Ukraine's former Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014.\n\nRussia responded to Yanukovych's ouster by annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and throwing its support to the separatists in the country's east. Since then, fighting there has killed more than 14,000 people and devastated the industrial heartland.\n\nPutin dedicated most of his annual address to domestic issues, hailing the nation's response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the quick development of three coronavirus vaccines underlined Russia's technological and industrial potential. He called for a quicker pace of immunizations, voicing hope the country could achieve collective immunity this fall.\n\nHe put forward incentives to help the economy recover from the pandemic and promised new social payments focusing on families with children.\n\n"},

The rule was abolished by 1992, but a virus is still playing by it -- halting teams right when they seem to be building up pace.India set off on the road after a year and in their first two official internationals, the team got the better of Olympic champions Argentina . But the day they returned home from South America, the virus struck again.India's next away fixture of the Pro League , which was scheduled for May 8 and 9 against Great Britain in London, has been postponed. With the virus mutating and spreading like wildfire in India, the government of the United Kingdom has put India on its 'red list'. Hence, the team can't travel.While that's the unfortunate bit, it doesn't take the shine off of what the Indian team achieved in Buenos Aires.The visitors showed some steel to come back and level the first game at 2-2, before claiming the bonus point in a shootout. The second game saw India dominating the hosts. A 3-0 win was the kind of scoreline coach Graham Reid was looking for.Of the six matches in the Argentine capital, India lost just one, which left Reid chuffed about the outcome.In an interview with Timesofindia.com at the conclusion of the tour, the Australian shared his notes, while keeping Covid central to what lies ahead on the road.We were very happy with the results. Of course, we lost that fifth game. Sometimes you need those wake-up calls every now and then for the players to understand that they have to bring out their best every time. Sometimes as a coach you sort of think, 'Okay, you need those things as medicines.'We need to be a little more frugal in defence. That's still valid. It's always (a) work in progress. As we play against [top] teams, they will try and do things differently to try and beat us. So we have to constantly change our structure a little bit.That's the great thing about competition -- the ability to keep plugging the hole. So when a team [opposition] does that, this is what we do. So if you have experienced it before, you end up with better planning at the end of it.The other thing, of course, is we are trying to make sure we make the most of all the opportunities and try and convert those opportunities into better ones. We had a good number of circle penetrations, but we would like to create more quality opportunities. That's what we will be spending a bit of time on between now and Europe [Pro League tours]. We are working on that.One of things that we worked on was our ability to maintain (a) sustained attack -- what I have been trying to develop with the guys. If the gap is not there at the moment, we [should] move the ball, go to the other side, check. It gives you a bit more control.What we are chasing, of course, is more quality attack based on that. Those things take a while. You train for something and then you see it starting to come [happen] in a game until a little later on. We need to keep working on that, getting them [players] to understand when it's better to just hold the ball, wait for the right opportunity. Having said that, I still like to attack (laughs). So there has to be the right balance.I prefer not to talk about selection in public, to be honest. All I can probably say is it's going to be a really tough selection [for upcoming tours]. Every time you are selecting from this [core] group, it's hard because the quality is there.What I am really trying to do is develop the breadth of the squad, which means when it comes to picking a team, you have the best players available...options. Covid is still a real concern, so you perhaps need even a broader base than you need in a normal campaign, so that you have got quality players who can come in at any point in time.That's what we are trying to do, provide opportunities and also provide as much competition in the squad so that we are pushing ourselves to be better and better.Tokyo will be a tough environment, when we have back-to-back games. That's the good thing about [Pro League tours of] Europe. We will get opportunities to play consecutive games. Historically at the Olympics, there's been a nice gap between games but this time there are going to be back-to-back games. So it's an important skill to have for players to be able to maintain the high tempo of the game.It's good to have players who give you experience but also some youth to bring in the enthusiasm and the extra energy. That's again a constant balance that you try to achieve as a coach.I've said this before, that with the changing scenario world-over due to Covid, we have to take each day as it comes. That is why I always tell the team to not worry about things that are not in our control.For now, our focus is to utilise the facilities in SAI Centre Bengaluru to make the necessary changes to our game based on the Argentina tour analysis and continue as per [Pro League] schedule in Spain and Germany."},

Read More\n\nCHENNAI: These are early days in the ongoing MotoGP season but former world champion Valentino Rossi is yet to get into the groove. Rossi --- a nine-time Grand Prix world champion out of which seven are in the premier MotoGP class --- has managed just four points from the first three races this season.\n\nRossi may not be at the peak of his powers, but the 42-year-old PETRONAS Yamaha SRT rider is eyeing a turnaround in fortunes at the Spanish MotoGP to be held at the Circuito de Jerez on May 2.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be fighting for a podium (at the Spanish GP ). If I want to win the title, I will have to be fast and deliver good results. And when you are older, you have to train harder to stay at the top level. Luckily, we also have a strong technical partner in PETRONAS that will push me to deliver strong finishes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the motor racing legend told TOI.\n\nRossi --- competing for the MotoGP crown with riders much younger to him --- looks for inspiration from icons in other sporting disciplines who have delivered strong shows despite either nearing or in their 40s.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy number 1 inspiration is Roger Federer. I adore his game and the way he carries himself. Federer continues to compete even at this age and will cheer for him to win that Wimbledon crown again. There are others such as Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u00c4\u0087 and Tom Brady who inspire me as well, but Federer is the one who tops the list,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Rossi, who is into his 26th year as a professional rider.\n\nRossi knows that he is nearer to the finish line in his career than ever but still wants to give it a shot this season and probably in 2022 before hanging up his boots.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my mind, I feel I can race this year and in 2022. But it will all depend on the results,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. Franco Morbidelli, Rossi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s teammate at PETRONAS Yamaha, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want anyone to count the seasoned campaigner out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf Rossi is able to notch up a few podium finishes in the coming races, then he can be one of the contenders to regain the title. He definitely has the potential,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Morbidelli, who had finished second in the MotoGP rankings last year.\n\nMorbidelli believes it is tough to replicate his 2020 season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance this year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more difficult than last year because we have the same package (in our bike) while the other riders have improved ones. It is going to be difficult to fight for the championship title but not impossible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Morbidelli who finished fourth in the Portugal GP last week.\n\n"},

But these are subject to getting the visas (Schengen visa).\n\n\"As of now, there is no mandatory quarantine period to be served after reaching Czech Republic. But nobody knows what the protocols will be at a later date.\"\n\nHe also said that all the track and field athletes and officials camping at the NIS Patiala have returned with negative RT-PCR tests conducted on April 19. Earlier, 10 track and field athletes and officials at the NIS have tested positive but none of them were Olympics-bound.\n\n\"All the 63 track and field athletes and 30 support staff have tested negative on April 19.
