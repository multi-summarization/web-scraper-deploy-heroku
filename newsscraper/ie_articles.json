Why this is a big deal", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-nasas-perseverance-mission-extracted-oxygen-mars-why-big-deal-7284595/", "cat": "explained", "content": "Since reaching the Martian surface in February, NASA\u2019s Perseverance mission has earned admiration for achieving feats that were only thought possible in science fiction, such as flying a helicopter there, which it did this week. The pioneering Mars rover has now added another feather to its cap.\n\nThe US space agency has announced that on Tuesday, a device aboard the rover was able to produce oxygen from the thin Martian atmosphere for the first time \u2013 a development that has brought cheer among the scientific community, as it promises hope for future crewed missions that can rely on this technology for astronauts to breathe and return to Earth.\n\nHow did Perseverance produce oxygen on Mars?\n\nIn its first operation since arriving on the Red Planet, the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) produced 5 grams of oxygen from carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere, enough for an astronaut to breathe for 10 minutes.\n\nOn Mars, carbon dioxide makes up ~96% of the gas in the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Oxygen is only 0.13%, compared to 21% in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Like a tree on Earth, MOXIE inhales carbon dioxide and exhales oxygen.\n\nTo produce oxygen, MOXIE separates oxygen atoms from carbon dioxide molecules. It does so by using heat at a temperature of around 800 degrees Celsius, and in the process also produces carbon monoxide as a waste product, which it releases in the Martian atmosphere.\n\nA technology demonstrator, MOXIE is designed to generate up to 10 grams of oxygen per hour, and is placed inside the Perseverance rover. It is the size of a car battery, weighing 37.7 pounds (17.1 kg) on Earth, but just 14.14 pounds (6.41 kg) on Mars.\n\nThrough its first successful run, MOXIE was able to demonstrate that it survived its launch from Earth, an almost seven-month journey through deep space, and landing on the Martian surface with Perseverance. Over the next two years, MOXIE is expected to extract oxygen nine more times.\n\nMOXIE is only a test model. Future oxygen generators that descend from its technology need to be about 100 times larger to support human missions on Mars.\n\nBut, why is producing oxygen on the Red Planet so important?\n\nA substantial amount of oxygen supply on Mars is essential for crewed missions that plan to go there\u2013 not just for astronauts to breathe but for rockets to use as fuel while coming back to Earth.\n\nAs per the NASA press release, for four astronauts to take off from Mars, a future mission would require around 7 metric tons of rocket fuel and 25 metric tons of oxygen\u2013 around the weight of an entire space shuttle. In contrast, astronauts living and working on Mars would require far less oxygen to breathe, maybe around one metric ton.\n\nScientists believe that it will be an enormous challenge to haul the 25 metric tons of oxygen from Earth to Mars for the return journey, and that their job would become significantly easier if the liquified oxygen can be produced on the Red Planet. This is where MOXIE\u2019s role comes in.\n\n\u201cWhen we send humans to Mars, we will want them to return safely, and to do that they need a rocket to lift off the planet. Liquid oxygen propellant is something we could make there and not have to bring with us. One idea would be to bring an empty oxygen tank and fill it up on Mars,\u201d said Michael Hecht, MOXIE\u2019s Principal Investigator.\n\nNASA hopes to build a larger technological descendant of the experimental MOXIE that can do this job. A one-ton oxygen converter of this kind would be much more economical and practical to take to Mars, instead of 25 metric tons of oxygen, the agency argues.\n\nJim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), called MOXIE\u2019s feat \u201ca critical first step at converting carbon dioxide to oxygen on Mars\u201d.\n\n\u201cMOXIE has more work to do, but the results from this technology demonstration are full of promise as we move toward our goal of one day seeing humans on Mars. Oxygen isn\u2019t just the stuff we breathe. Rocket propellant depends on oxygen, and future explorers will depend on producing propellant on Mars to make the trip home.\u201d"},

(File Photo)\n\nThe Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), based on a report submitted by its expert panel, has made an official announcement Wednesday claiming that Jabali near Akasha Ganga waterfall in Tirumala Hills of Andhra Pradesh was the birthplace of Hanuman. The TTD made the announcement on Rama Navami, even as its earlier claims were contested by Karnataka which has at least two contenders for the claims \u2014 one near Hampi and another in Gokarna.\n\nThe TTD, which manages shrines including the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Andhra Pradesh, had formed an expert panel comprising Vedic scholars, archaeologists and an ISRO scientist to study and submit a report pinpointing the actual birthplace of Hanuman.National Sanskrit University Vice-Chancellor V Muralidhara Sharma, one of the member committee, said they established the fact that Tirumala is the birthplace of Hanuman after four months of intensive research. \u201cBased on puranic anthologies, literary scientific and epigraphic evidence, as well geographic details available, Hanuman was born on Anjanadri in Treta Yuga.

We have a small house, three buffaloes and grow plants in two pots,\u201d the 17-year-old specifies, slowly.\n\nThe fencer, who was at the National Centre of Excellence in Patiala, has been busy correcting a Nationals-score mention against Olympics-bound Bhavani Devi from last month in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand. \u201cIt was 4-15. Not 14-15. Anyway she won,\u201d the 16-year-old stresses.\n\nIt was an error\u2014the press printed it as 14-15 after Bhavani picked the title, when it was 4-15, but it has fired up Baby\u2019s ambition. \u201cBut you must write about the first time I played her. I got 3 points, she got 5. I fought fearlessly. Now there\u2019s fear because she\u2019s Olympics level. Still, I gave her a very good fight,\u201d she says, adding earnestly that the press should call her next when she beats her idol.\n\nA sport that was the preserve of the aristocracy in Europe and posh clubs across the first world, is unearthing talent from India\u2019s remote rural areas.\n\nThree of the five fencers who will travel to Tashkent, Uzbekistan, for the last Olympic qualifying tournament this week, are children of farmers. The group includes sabre\u2019s big hope in men, Karan Singh, whose father tills a tiny patch of land on contract in Alwar, Rajasthan. Th Kabita Devi, looking to pounce on the sole qualifying spot in Epee from the continental meet, has a parent in Silchar police.\n\nBicky Thokchom of Bashikhong in Imphal, Manipur, is also the son of a farmer. While Radhika Avati, who also fences foil, comes from a farming family in Sangli. Epee fencer Sunil Kumar\u2019s father is an ex-serviceman now farming in Jhunjhunu, and it is India\u2019s silent scouting efforts staking out far-flung areas from 2008-9 that have handpicked these potential winners.\n\nBlades that were once held by princes only for their leisure are now picking targets while wielded by children of peasants and beat police. Bhavani has lit a competitive drive across coaching centres of India. Her own background, she came from a middle class home herself, has meant ambitions are upgraded across the nation to aim at the Olympics, undeterred by the prohibitive costs of the equipment.\n\nBaby Reddy (R) with Bhavani Devi. (File) Baby Reddy (R) with Bhavani Devi. (File)\n\nWhile Baby belongs to Kadapa in Andhra, she was scouted by coach Bhavani Prasad Dhungana for her speed and combative confidence in a football match. \u201cShe was chubby in Class 3 too. But she was so fast while running and in football and the first time she held the weapon, there was no fear. Good aggressive attacking and footwork and confident in lunges. So we brought her from Kadapa to Hakimpet centre,\u201d says the coach.\n\nSports Authority of Telangana would fund her education and training at a sports school as she started picking medals nationally. And now the teenager is biding her time to be assigned her personal gear at Patiala, while dreaming of her next shy at the iconic Bhavani, set to be India\u2019s first fencing Olympian.\n\nWhile India\u2019s top six in women\u2019s sabre come from Kerala\u2019s Thalassery centre, the state government sanctioned five more centres in fencing\u2019s southern nursery from where Bhavani took her first strides.\n\nAs many as 200 fencers are training in the wings at Munnar, Wayanad and Ernakulam in Kerala, besides the two centres at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu.\n\nSagar Lagu, who started out in Sangli when his local gymnasium owner Rekha Nene went in for a diploma at NIS to coach her daughter in the sport, has pushed the Kerala surge. A topper at NIS himself\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m an accidental coach,\u201d he says \u2013 Lagu was posted to Kerala. \u201cIn 2008 I sent 20 odd coaches to get their coaching certification from Kerala. Then we looked for raw talent from other sports,\u201d says Lagu, who was instrumental in getting Bhavani to Coonoor from Chennai.\n\nA junior Commonwealth and Asian medallist himself, he remembers India\u2019s early days in the sport internationally. It resembled relay-fencing.\n\nComical outings in the past\n\n\u201cOnly one mask and blade would be shared by all. So the board-call announcements would happen somewhere and our fencer would be at another piste waiting for that match to get over and grab his mask and sword. They\u2019d run to where they were to compete wearing the mask on the way and then the next fencer would pick up the equipment and run. It was comical for anyone watching and so many were carded out because a teammate\u2019s match hadn\u2019t finished and the mask wasn\u2019t available,\u201d he recalls.\n\nIn the last few years, fencing has been elevated to a priority sport.\n\nAnd there are grand plans of Excellence centres across the country with foreign coaches to be roped in. The pandemic has put a sorrowful pause on the sport at developmental level. But even before Bhavani\u2019s qualification\u2014a tactical collecting of points was secured\u2014parts of India were buzzing with startup promise.\n\nLike Kerala, state centres have been excellent feeders with diligent low key SAI coaches toiling away in Bhopal, Telangana, Aurangabad to go with the two traditional powerhouses Manipur and Punjab.\n\n\u201cCoaches are scouting out from government and municipal schools as well as village sports meets,\u201d says SAI Patiala coach Kishan Kumar.\n\nA haul of 36 medals at Olympics is the incentive, but some centres throw up natural talent in hordes. Like the Jammu Kashmir State Council centre which is brimming with numbers of talented fencers, nurtured technically by astute coaches.\n\n\u201cFor the first 6-7 months, I don\u2019t even give athletes a real blade. They have to be fundamentally strong and disciplined. Immaturity is not permitted in this sport. And whether it\u2019s Aurangabad or J&K, all centres have coaches who drill in basics meticulously,\u201d he says.\n\nKaran Singh was picked for the Army Boys company sports school from Rajasthan along with Chunilal, son of another farmhand. Shiv Mangesh of Kanyakumari was scouted out and quickly got over the shyness he felt as the son of a labourer. Joshna Joseph, Bhavani\u2019s strongest opponent, has a farmer father.\n\nAs does foil champion Radhika, who comes from the Thalassery centre. \u201cInitial weapon is Rs 10,000 to 15,000 thousand. But training centres are taking care of that,\u201d Lagu says.\n\nMumbai though is seeing a mushrooming of fencing clubs in middle class localities of Navi Mumbai and Thane.\n\n\u201cThose clubs also get kids from modest backgrounds. Fencing has no lack of driven athletes, now aiming higher because of Bhavani,\u201d Lagu says."},

From July 16 to December 9, 2020, 146 participants were randomly assigned \u2014 73 to usual care and 73 to budesonide.\n\nThe study results showed that inhaled budesonide significantly reduced the risk of urgent care visit, emergency department assessment or hospitalisation versus the usual care arm by 91 percent.\n\nDr Sundeep Salvi, chair at the chronic respiratory diseases section for the Global Burden of Disease Study for India, (who is not attached with the Lancet study) told The Indian Express that the study results have come as a pleasant surprise as an asthma drug can help alleviate some of the suffering of Covid-19 patients.\n\n\u201cIt is important to remember here that the trial participants were people with mild symptoms and did not include those with severe symptoms or hospitalisation. The study has shown the use of inhaled budesonide in early mild cases has a 90 per cent chance of preventing hospitalisation,\u201d Dr Salvi, who is also on the board of directors of the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, said. It can be a potential game changer, which is widely available and safe, Dr Salvi added.\n\nIn the Lancet study, patients in the budesonide arm received a budesonide dry powder inhaler at a dose of 800 \u03bcg twice a day. Participants, administered budesonide, were asked to stop taking the inhaler when they felt they had recovered or if they had a primary outcome (Covid-19-related urgent care visit, emergency department assessment or hospitalisation).\n\nInhaled budesonide was taken for a median duration of seven days in the study. In the other group, the usual care was supportive therapy, with the National Health Service (NHS) advising patients with Covid-19 symptoms to take antipyretics for symptoms of fever (products containing paracetamol, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as aspirin and ibuprofen) and honey for symptoms of cough.\n\nInhaled budesonide in early Covid-19 infection significantly reduced the likelihood of requiring urgent care, emergency department consultation and hospitalisation, the study results showed.\n\nIn another updated interim, analysis (published in medRxiv preprint by authors from the same group at Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine and Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford) showed that inhaled budesonide reduced the time to recovery by a median of three days in people with Covid-19 with risk factors for adverse outcomes."},

It is not necessary to have an emergency reason to travel by these modes of transport.\n\nThe order said the local railway officers / Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) officers shall provide all information to the local disaster management authority, which screens passengers at the alighting point.\n\nThere, they will need to undergo 14 days home quarantine. Their hands will be stamped. If anyone shows symptoms during thermal screening, they will be removed to a corona care centre or hospital depending on the severity of their symptoms.\n\nWhat about private transport?\n\nPrivate passenger transport such as taxis and autorickshaws are permitted to run only for emergency or essential services or valid reasons with the driver plus 50 per cent of the seating capacity.\n\n\u201cThese are not expected to be inter-district or inter-city and should be confined to the city of residence of the travellers. Inter-district or inter-city travel by private transport is allowed only if required for performing an essential service or in case of medical emergencies or attending unavoidable events like funerals or severe sickness of family,\u201d stated the order.\n\nThe order further said that the private buses can ply with 50 per cent of the seating capacity with no standing passengers and the people allowed to use it for any reason for inter-district travel in the state. The passengers shall be stamped on hand for 14-day home quarantine by the bus operator, it added.\n\nThe state has further said that bus service operators must restrict the stoppages to a maximum of two in a city and shall inform the local authority about the schedule. Thermal scanners shall be used and anyone with symptoms shall be moved to corona care centre or to a hospital.\n\nThe official said that private vehicles are allowed to be used for city and inter-district travel only for essential services and for medical emergencies or attending unavoidable events like funerals or severe sickness of family.\n\n\u201cBut, they need to satisfy the police on it as the police will be stopping all the private vehicles and will be inquiring about the reasons for their travel,\u201d added the official.\n\nWhat are the other new restrictions?\n\nIt said that all government offices such as central, state and local authority can operate only with 15 per cent attendance except for emergency services directly connected to the management of covid pandemic. In the case of Mantralaya, the state secretariat, and central government office in Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the head of the department can decide on higher attendance after seeking permission from the CEO of the Maharashtra State Disaster Management Authority.\n\nFor all other offices of essential services, they should work with at lowest required capacity and in no case exceed 50 per cent.\n\nFor the offices such as PSU and private banks, offices of companies providing essential services, insurance/mediclaim companies, pharmaceutical company offices, RBI regulated entities and intermediaries with others should function only with 15 per cent of the total attendance or 5 people whichever is more, it added.\n\nFor marriage ceremonies, the government has said that it may be conducted only as a single event in a single hall not extending beyond 2 hours with a maximum of total 25 persons attending the same. \u201cWith restrictions of 25 people, there were instances of people being invited in different batches throughout the day. So we have restricted it to 2 hours and with a total of 25 people attendance for it,\u201d said an official.\n\nWhat are the powers given to the local authorities?\n\nThe state has said that the local authority can waive off the rules regarding mandatory stamping for buses arriving from certain origins as per the local conditions.\n\nFor inter-district travel by long-distance trains, state-owned buses and private buses, the government has asked the local authority to decide on the Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) test of the passengers at the alighting point by appointing authorised labs. The cost of the test will be borne by the passenger. \u201cWe want to promote the RAT test, which is 50 per cent accurate but all the districts do not have the capacity to do it. So, they can take a call depending on the local situation,\u201d said the official.\n\nWhat about shopping?\n\nGroceries are allowed to open for four hours only in the morning, from 7 am to 11 am. Home deliveries from grocery shops and restaurants are allowed until 8 pm. Chemists shops are open until 8 pm. No other shops are allowed to remain open. Malls are shut. If any essential shops are located in malls, only those can open for the permitted four hours in the morning."},

With the Centre extending the vaccination to those aged between 18 and 45 from May 1, Punjab will be providing the vaccine free those within this age group as well.\n\nIn view of limited supplies of the vaccine expected initially, the CM constituted an \u2018expert group\u2019 comprising eminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, Dr Jacob John, Professor of Community Health at CMC in Vellore and Dr Rajesh Kumar former head, School of Public Health, PGIMER, in Chandigarh to suggest prioritisation in the 18-45 age group.\n\nThe CM tasked the expert group to chalk out a vaccination strategy and submit a detailed plan to the state government within a week.\n\nEminent virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang, who attended the meeting as a special invitee, emphasised the need to have a proper strategy to combat the current second wave of Covid, with geographical saturation in high caseload cities such as Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Mohali, and Patiala besides prioritisation on the basis of medical need (serious co-morbidity) and on the basis of professional groups such as teachers.\n\nThe chief minister was informed that the state received 4 lakh more doses of Covishield vaccine from the Centre Thursday. As these were likely to last the state for only 3 or 4 more days as per the pace of the ongoing vaccination drive, he asked the health department to vigorously pursue with the Union government for ensuring requisite supply of more Covishield vaccine besides getting requisite stock of Covaxin doses as well.\n\nReferring to the reports of black marketing of anti-viral drugs like Remdesivir and Tocilizumab in the country, the chief minister said the experts have given clear protocols on the use of such medicines, which must be duly publicised and followed in right earnest.\n\nHealth Adviser Dr KK Talwar referred to the World Health Organisation (WHO) studies have shown that Remdesivir may not have any impact on the mortality due to Covid. Further, there were alternatives for Tocilizumab and such information is being regularly shared in the expert group of doctors.\n\nAmarinder directed that the state should, however, continue to procure such drugs for patients who may benefit from their use, and provide the same to the government hospitals and also support the private hospitals, as was already being done.\n\nCabinet meeting in Himachal\n\n\u201cAlthough it will be a huge burden on the ex-chequer, the decision (to provide free vaccines) has been made keeping in mind general public welfare. The free vaccine will be provided in government health institutions,\u201d said Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Bhardwaj after a Cabinet meeting in Himachal Pradesh.\n\n\u201cThe Cabinet decided to form mobile health teams at the block level to provide better treatment to Covid patients under home isolation. Each team will be given one vehicle exclusively to transfer the serious patients. Moreover, each medical college will now have a dedicated team headed by a senior doctor to monitor Covid cases. Each outsourced employee engaged in Covid duty will be given an incentive of Rs 200 per shift and Covid patients under home isolation will be provided with a nutrition kit,\u201d he said.\n\nBhardwaj added that deputy commissioners have been permitted to impose Covid-related restrictions in their districts but with prior consultation with the state government.\n\nNo night curfew in HP, govt flags \u2018fake news\u2019\n\nNo night curfew has currently been imposed in Himachal Pradesh, the state government said on Thursday while reacting to fake news about night curfew on the social media.\n\n\u201cNews which is being circulated in a certain section of social media regarding night curfew in the state is baseless and devoid of facts. As of now, there is no plan of any night restriction or curfew in the state. Only a few night restrictions have been imposed in Kangra district due to a sudden increase in Covid cases there,\u201d said a government spokesperson, adding that in case there is a sharp surge in Covid cases, the concerned district administrations will make the final call regarding night restrictions in their districts after consulting with the state government.\n\nOther Cabinet decisions\n\n*The services of daily/contingent government workers who have completed or will be completing five years of continuous services as on March 31 or September 30 this year will be regularised against available vacant posts in various government departments\n\n*Services of contractual employees who have completed or will be completing three years of services as on March 31 or September 30 will be regularised in various state government departments\n\n*Similarly, part-time government workers completing eight years of continuous services will be converted into daily-wagers\n\n*19 posts of technical and ministerial staff in newly-opened State Seri Entrepreneurship Development and Innovation Centre at Balichowki in Mandi district to be filled up\n\n*A new government industrial training institute (ITI) with a staff of 26 persons will be opened at Baroti in Dharampur tehsil of Mandi district\n\n*The chief minister and other ministers in the cabinet contributed their one-month salary towards the CM Covid Fund"},

Eleanor Holmes-Norton, D-D.C., left, at a news conference ahead of the House vote on H.R. 51- the Washington, DC Admission Act, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, April 21, 2021. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nA decades-long movement to reshape the American political map took a further step Thursday as the House of Representatives approved a bill to make the nation\u2019s capital the 51st state.\n\nVoting along party lines with minority Republicans in opposition, the House approved the bill 216-208. That\u2019s likely the easy part, though. The proposal faces a far tougher fight in the Senate, where simple Democratic control of the chamber won\u2019t be enough.\n\nThe legislation proposes creating a 51st state with one representative and two senators, while a tiny sliver of land including the White House, the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall would remain as a federal district. Instead of the District of Columbia, the new state would be known\n\nas Washington, Douglass Commonwealth named after famed abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who lived in Washington from 1877 until his death in 1895.\n\nAn identical statehood bill passed the House in 2020, but it quickly died in the then-Republican-controlled Senate. Now, with the 2020 elections leaving Democrats in control of both chambers and the White House, Republican senators may resort to a filibuster to stymie the statehood bill.\n\nFor lifelong statehood proponents like Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington\u2019s long-serving and nonvoting delegate in the House, Thursday\u2019s vote was a culmination of a life\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cMy service in the Congress has been dedicated to achieving equality for the people I represent, which only statehood can provide,\u201d Norton said at a Wednesday news conference. \u201cMy life as a third-generation Washingtonian has marched toward this milestone.\u201d\n\nThe measure has received strong support from President Joe Biden\u2019s White House, which released a statement Tuesday calling Washington\u2019s current status \u201can affront to the democratic values on which our Nation was founded\u201d.\n\nThe White House praised Washington as worthy of statehood, with \u201ca robust economy, a rich culture, and a diverse population of Americans from all walks of life who are entitled to full and equal participation in our democracy\u201d.\n\nThe bill is certain to face GOP pushback, given that the proposed 51st state would be overwhelmingly Democratic. That opposition was on display during Thursday morning\u2019s floor debates in advance of the vote.\n\nThe country\u2019s founding fathers, \u201cnever wanted D.C. to be a state and then specifically framed the constitution to say so\u201d, said Georgia Republican Rep. Jody Hice. \u201cThis is absolutely against what our founders intended and it ought to be soundly rejected.\u201d\n\nBut Virginia Democratic Rep. Gerald Connolly pointed out that Kentucky was once a part of Virginia, and was carved out as a state by a simple act of Congress.\n\nConnolly argued that the federal district was a theoretical concept when first conceived, not a community with a higher population than two U.S. states.\n\n\u201cWhen the constitution was written, this place didn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen people say this is not about race and partisanship, you can be sure it\u2019s about race and partisanship.\u201d\n\nDuring a March hearing by the House oversight committee, a succession of GOP representatives claimed D.C. was unfit for statehood while calling the entire effort a cynical Democratic power play. Opponents proposed a variety of alternatives, from absolving Washingtonians of federal taxes to \u201cretroceding\u201d most of D.C. back into Maryland.\n\nContenting that Congress lacks the authority to change D.C.\u2019s status is a frequent point of attack against the proposal \u201ceven though every state other than the original 13 was admitted to the union via congressional vote. Statehood opponents say D.C. is a special case that requires special steps.\n\nZack Smith, a legal fellow at the Heritage Institute, a conservative think tank, testified before Congress last month that since D.C.\u2019s creation and limitations are are enshrined in Article I of the Constitution, its status can only be changed through a constitutional amendment.\n\nHe also argued that D.C. shouldn\u2019t be made a state at all and that the Founding Fathers \u201cintended this to be a federal district outside the jurisdiction of any one state\u201d.\n\nIf the measure were to become law, Smith predicted a wave of lawsuits that would cloud the new state\u2019s actions and any congressional legislation it touched.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re basically looking at a lot of litigation,\u201d Smith told The Associated Press. \u201cEvery legislative act of this new state would be called into question. \u2026 Things would be in a state of flux for years.\u201d\n\nD.C. has long chafed under its relationship with Congress, which has the power to essentially veto or alter any local laws. Its population is larger than that of Wyoming or Vermont and its estimated 712,000 residents pay federal taxes, vote for president and serve in the armed forces, but they have no voting representation in Congress.\n\nThe limitations of D.C.\u2019s reality were put in stark relief last summer during a series of protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and against general police brutality. After a night of widespread vandalism, President Donald Trump usurped D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s authority and called in a massive multiagency federal force to downtown. The law enforcement forces cleared peaceful protesters from a public street so Trump could pose for a photo outside a church."},

(File)\n\nIn November 2019, when Ankush Chormule and his five fellow directors decided to launch Ganna Master \u2014 the speciality product aimed at better per acre yield for cane farmers, they had almost zero experience of markets. What they had was immense \u2018on field\u2019 practical knowledge about the cane crop.\n\nChormule and his fellow directors were traditional cane growers across the cane belt of South Maharashtra and North Karnataka and by virtue of their agricultural practices, were \u2018champion farmers\u2019. \u201cAs against the normal 50-60 tonnes per acre, our individual acreage was around 100 tonnes per acre. What we aimed to do with the Ganna Master Kit was share our package of practices with farmers so that they, too, can increase per acre yield,\u201d said Chormule, whose family grows cane over nine acres in the village of Ashta in Walva taluka of Sangli district.\n\nEven before they hit the markets, Chormule, who has a PhD in agricultural entomology, and his team was working with cane growers in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh. Through their Facebook group Hoy Amhi Shetkari (HAM), the team has been in touch with over 4 lakh cane growers across the sugar producing states.\n\nHailing from families of farmers whose main source of income was the cane crop, these men knew the crop like the back of their hand, Chormule said. Sugar mills pay farmers per tonne of cane procured, so higher the tonnage, higher the payment\n\n\u201cBesides basic minerals and nitrogen fixers, cane requires boosters and micro-nutrients to enable better growth and increase per acre tonnage. In our personal fields, we take spraying of amino acid, fulvic acid and cytokinins to accelerate the vegetative growth of cane,\u201d he said. Similarly, potassium humate,vitamins and organic phosphates have given a good result in increasing the girth ratio and preventing cane from lodging, Chormule said. The directors, most of whom are administrators of Hoy Ami Shetkari group, have been guiding farmers through their Facebook page on how to improve agricultural practices.\n\n\u201cOf course, these act like tonics, the farmer should ensure the basic remains strong and he adheres to proper planning for the crop,\u201d he said.\n\nThe team is advised by a retired soil scientist form the Mahatma Phule Agricultural University. Besides Chormule, the team includes Suresh Kabade, Amol Patil, Prakash Khot, Vijay Magdum and Prasad Pawar.\n\nWhile working with farmers, the group had zeroed in on five chemicals, which gave the best result. The final kit has Master root, Master Bonus, Master Growth and Master Speed to be either sprayed or applied through water. Applied individually, these would cost Rs 1,000 per application but the Kit offers them same at Rs 2,600. Before going on the stalls, the kits were distributed free-of-cost to farmers to be applied over 300 acres. \u201cThe results were very successful\u2026in fact, it was enough for us to launch our company,\u201d he said. Before joining the company, Chormule was on the staff of a Singapore-based input company but resigned to join the Ganna Master Agro Industries Private Limited.\n\nThe company started with a modest investment of Rs 10 lakh and directors working from their homes. Social media, especially Facebook, was the platform of choice for spreading the word. \u201cOur initial operations were restricted to the districts of Sangli and Kolhapur. But since then, we have spread to all the cane growing areas in Maharashtra, Karnataka and even in Uttar Pradesh,\u201d said Chormule.\n\nFrom selling 200 kits a month at first, the company now sells over 2,500 kits a month. The company has followed a very lean but organic model for growth. \u201cOur aim was to reach the farmer directly. So, we have managed to keep the overheads less,\u201d he said.\n\nHailing from families whose main source of income was farming, the group understood the complex economics of agriculture perhaps better than any one else. \u201cWe act as cane consultants but with firmer roots on the ground,\u201d said Chormule.\n\nSince its launch, the company has expanded its footprint and invested in packaging and a storehouse in Pune. This year, the company has launched on a trial basis Onion Master, Turmeric Master and Vegetable Master kits for other crops."},

As advocate Shyel Trehan informed the court that Haryana\u2019s Fortis Hospital, Haryana, has flagged its shortage of oxygen, Mehta said, \u201cThis is what exactly we wanted to highlight. These are competing interests.

The state government\u2019s reply comes after the Madras High Court took suo motu notice of newspaper reports on the shortage of Remdesivir and ventilators in the state and diversion of oxygen from a city plant to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.\n\nThe bench headed by Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy directed Vijay Narayanan, the advocate general for Tamil Nadu, to get clear instructions from the government to ensure that the state his handling the issue properly.\n\nIn the second half of the day, AG Vijay Narayanan informed the court that Tamil Nadu is one of the very few states with no shortage of ventilators at a time of dire need and the manufacturing is far ahead of requirement. He further added that there are about 9,600 ventilators of which 5,887 are earmarked for Covid-19 treatment and in private there about 6000 ventilators and 3,000 of them have been earmarked for the treatment of the deadly viral.\n\nThe court said if the state has sufficient resources, it should also be helping other states as well. The court further added that it will post the matter for further hearing on Monday when the state is expected to produce more details on beds and vaccine availability.\n\nTamil Nadu government asserted that it has adequate stock of oxygen but would take up with the Centre the issue of diversion of about 45 metric tonnes of medical oxygen to neighbouring states.\n\nHealth Secretary J Radhakrishnan said the state had been providing oxygen to its neighbouring states which are running a deficit of medical oxygen. However, he said the diversion initiated by the Centre should not create any trouble in the state in future and hence, they would take up the issue with the Centre to ensure that the situation is comfortable for them in the future as well.\n\nWhile rejecting the claim that some deaths at the Vellore hospital took place due to the lack of oxygen supply, Tamil Nadu Health Minister C Vijayabaskar reaffirmed that the state has enough oxygen and vaccine supply and there is no need to panic. \u201cThe liquid medical oxygen manufacturing capacity is around 400 metric tonnes a day in Tamil Nadu and the daily medical consumption of oxygen is around 240 tonnes per day. We have a strong healthcare base here in Tamil Nadu. The state has a storage capacity of around 1,200 tonnes,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday.\n\nHe also added that there won\u2019t be much wastage of vaccines from May 1 as the Centre has allowed everyone above 18 years to get vaccinated. \u201cUnlike states like Maharashtra, Delhi and Gujarat which are reporting high Covid-19 cases and have an acute shortage of oxygen cylinders, Tamil Nadu is well equipped with oxygen supply. There are 32,405 oxygen beds in Tamil Nadu and 6,504 oxygen beds in Chennai. There are 54,342 beds in Tamil Nadu to even deal with severe cases,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, patients in some of the districts with high Covid cases raised complaints about lack of beds. For instance, in Chengalpet district, which had been reporting the second most number of cases in Tamil Nadu after Chennai, there was a shortage of beds for patients. Some patients were made to wait inside the ambulance near the hospital for hours with oxygen support. Close to 75 of the oxygen beds in these districts (including private hospitals) are occupied.\n\nSome of the private hospitals with medium facilities are anticipating a scarcity of oxygen. As per the data provided by the government on the availability of beds in private hospitals, the admission request is double the times the available beds. For instance, a private hospital with 34 bed facilities is having 72 patients in queue. The patients are made to wait for long hours for their turn. Beds allocated for Covid-19 and suspected cases, oxygen-supported beds and ICU beds were all occupied.\n\nA senior doctor from the Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association said the state has enough supply of beds and panic was caused by some of the patients, who wanted to get admitted to the hospital despite having mild symptoms.\n\n\u201cWe have not reached the \u2018deficit\u2019 stage here in Tamil Nadu. Oxygen-supported beds are available in government hospitals. The state is planning to increase the facility as well. The anxiety of some of the patients causes much trouble to some of them in serious need. Those with lower oxygen levels and comorbidities are not getting admission. This forces the private hospitals to push the severe cases to government hospitals at the last moment which creates unnecessary tension and stress for doctors. Maybe the government can bring more awareness by displaying the availability of beds in a public domain and admit people on the basis of severity. Mild cases can be handled at home. People staying in health care centres should stay there. If this could be ensured, there will be less load of patients in hospitals. A possible tie-up between government and private hospitals will also curb the spread of the pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition DMK and AMMK slammed the diversion of oxygen by the Centre. DMK president MK Stalin said the Centre should have checked the situation in Tamil Nadu with the government and charged it with not taking the states seriously. AMMK founder TTV Dhinakaran said the Centre\u2019s decision to divert the oxygen from Tamil Nadu without consulting the state administration is not acceptable.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)"},

But hospitals have been complaining of an acute shortage of oxygen since Monday \u2014 and some have been turning away patients despite having beds only because there is no oxygen to administer to them.\n\nGTB, the second largest Covid facility in the capital after Lok Nayak Hospital, was among the hospitals that sounded an alarm over depleting oxygen stocks on Wednesday. They did get some supply, but it was not enough to meet the demand.\n\nAt the hospital\u2019s gate on Thursday, security guards pleaded that the emergency unit was understaffed and stretched to breaking point.\n\nThere were several cases like that of the woman who died on the stretcher. One family with whom The Indian Express could speak to fleetingly said they had been allowed to go in after a wait of several hours. The patient, who was 53 years old, died around 3 pm.\n\nShashank Tomar (29), who said he was the patient\u2019s nephew, said his uncle had symptoms of Covid, but they had been unable to get him tested for the virus. \u201cHe had fever for two days and shortness of breath since last night. We got him to the hospital today because he needed oxygen support. We wanted to get him tested but that would have taken a few hours, and he was in critical need of oxygen.\u201d He was given oxygen at the hospital, but it was too late by then, Tomar said.\n\nHospitals have been complaining of an acute shortage of oxygen since Monday \u2014 and some have been turning away patients despite having beds only because there is no oxygen to administer to them.

They had made rounds of a number of clinics, including Jyoti Nursing Home and Kapoor Medical Centre, since the morning, but had failed to get admission, Singh said.\n\nAt GTB, Singh\u2019s father-in-law collapsed on the ground, after which a ward boy called them inside so that he could be put on oxygen support. Singh said he had been tested for Covid, but had not got the result yet.\n\n\u201cWe do not know if it is Covid\u2026 he started having breathing problems two days ago. He has diabetes. We came here to check if he had Covid, and to get him on oxygen support,\u201d Singh said.\n\nSingh was among many who could not find an ambulance to bring the patient to hospital. Pramod Kumar Sharma (56), who was able to get his younger brother (37) admitted to the emergency unit after a long wait said they had come to the hospital in their own vehicle. Emerging from the emergency ward, he told The Indian Express that oxygen was in short supply, and not everyone was getting it.\n\nA patient waiting outside LNJP Hospital in New Delhi on Thursday.

At around 2 pm, a patient who had collapsed in the auto was immediately taken in on a stretcher. A few were admitted to the casualty ward.\n\nMost families who reached the emergency unit did not know if their patient had Covid or not. Patients and their families waited in a line outside the emergency unit and guards struggled to manage the situation. Some patients were on stretchers, others needed the help of a family member to walk.\n\nAt 2.55 pm, a fight broke out between a family who had just lost a patient and a doctor. The doctor had arrived for his duty at 3 pm. When the family asked him why he was not inside helping patients at the time, he explained that there was a team of doctors and nurses doing the needful. However, the infuriated family said nobody was present inside to help them when their patient was struggling to survive.\n\nFamilies also complained that the Corona app showed that there were over 300 vacant beds in the hospital. Yet, very few were being admitted and critical patients with breathing problems were being taken into the emergency ward, where they said they were given little to no care."},

I have held a detailed discussion with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cA roster has now been made for filling of oxygen cylinders and loading these cylinders onto trucks from Panipat oxygen plant. From now on, one truck will be loaded for Haryana and one truck each for Delhi and Punjab. This entire process at Panipat plant is being closely monitored by me,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cA total of 170 metric tonnes of oxygen was supplied to Delhi from 10 pm to 6 am today from the Panipat plant. Furthermore, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal had also received a call and expressed satisfaction for the supply of oxygen from the plant. The Panipat plant has a capacity of producing 260 MT of oxygen per day, out of which 140 MT is supplied to Delhi, 80 MT is supplied to Haryana and about 20 MT is for Punjab. Haryana is also supplied 20 MT from Bhiwadi plant in Rajasthan. However, yesterday there was some problem in the supply. Today, I shall talk to the Rajasthan CM,\u201d Khattar said.\n\nResponding to a question regarding the current status of availability of beds with ventilators for Covid patients in hospitals across the state, Khattar said, \u201cThe facility of beds has been made online in Gurugram and Faridabad districts. Besides this, around 500 beds have been arranged at SGT Medical College, Gurugram, 150 beds are being arranged in the industrial area and 50 more beds have been arranged, today.

Apart from this, talks are also being held with the Army Commander, Western Command, Chandimandir and efforts are being made to ensure availability of doctors and other facilities by the Army.\u201d\n\nResponding to a news item printed in an English daily regarding wasting of vaccine doses, Khattar said, \u201cThe news is baseless. In Haryana, wastage of Covid vaccine is only 1.5 per cent, which is within the prescribed limit. Once a dose is opened for vaccination, only 20-40 injections are utilised. Sometimes because of difference in number of doses opened and administered also becomes a reason for wastage.\u201d\n\nResponding to a question regarding blackmarketing of Remedesivir injection, Khattar said, \u201c1000 Remedesivir injections were supplied in government hospitals till yesterday and the supply will be further increased in government hospitals. However, private hospitals are making arrangement for this injection at their own levels. There is a need to create awareness in society. Even in an pandemic-like situation, if someone is doing blackmarketing, strict action will be taken against those involved in this crime.\u201d\n\nTalking about the rates fixed for ventilator-beds in private hospitals, Khattar said, \u201cAs per the infrastructure facilities offered in private hospitals, the charges of ventilator beds are fixed from Rs 8000 to Rs 18,000. If a hospital charges more than this, strict action will be taken against it, provided any complaint in this regard is received.\u201d\n\nKhattar reiterated that there would be no lockdown in Haryana and industrial units would be allowed to function. \u201cThis time because of the ongoing pandemic, no industrial unit would be shut down. However, industries which are running their operations in congested areas will be asked to follow the prescribed Covid protocols while carrying out their operations.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cCovid guidelines have been issued for wedding ceremonies and other social programmes. As per the guidelines, a gathering of upto 50 people is allowed inside a marriage palace, while in outdoor venues, the gathering limit should be only 200 persons. Similarly, a gathering of only 20 persons is allowed for cremation.\u201d\n\nOn April 21, the state had recorded its biggest single-day spike both in terms of new infections and fatalities by reporting 9,623 new infections and 45 deaths.\n\nThe state government Thursday also changed its academic calendar and announced summer vacations in all government and private schools till May 31.\n\n\u201cIn view of the prevailing conditions due to pandemic, the state government has decided to change the academic calendar of the session 2021-22.

He did not care about what people would say or how they would react. So some people liked him so much, some people did not like him but it did not deter him. He kept on saying what he really believed in.\u201d\n\nThis is how Zafarul Islam Khan remembers his father, Maulana Wahiduddin Khan, the noted Islamic scholar, spiritual leader and author who passed away Wednesday due to Covid-19 complications.\n\nThe 97-year-old was a towering personality not just in India or among Muslims in the country but throughout the Islamic world. He was internationally recognised and was known for his Gandhian views. He advocated peaceful coexistence in a multi-ethnic society which won him thousands of admirers, but also provoked the hardliners or a section of the Muslim community.\n\nFor instance, his views on the Ayodhya dispute asking Muslims to relinquish claims over Babri Masjid site riled many. In 1993, he wrote: \u201cThe issue of Ayodhya\u2019s Babri masjid has turned into one of life and death for the Muslim community. The tragic event of December 6 gave a serious jolt to the conscience of the country. What was deplorable was that it made a mockery of the promises by the leaders of the Ram mandir movement. Given all these factors, the destruction of the mosque was not simply the demolition of a structure; it was akin to the negation of an entire history.\u201d\n\nHe, however, advanced a three-point peace formula, which, he said, could solve the problem provided the Hindus, Muslims and the government accepted the responsibility of abiding by it.\n\nHe said the \u201cmovement launched by the Hindus should be stopped at Ayodhya\u201d.\n\n\u201cAssurance to this effect could take the form of a written declaration signed by all the four Shankaracharyas and by responsible people belonging to those Hindu organizations involved in the mandir-masjid movement. This should expressly state that after Ayodhya\u2019s Babri mosque, no mosque\u2019s right to continued existence will ever again be challenged by the Hindus; that all mosques in India, whatever their historical origins, will always be recognised and maintained as holy places of worship; so that Hindus will never seek justification for demanding any change in future\u201d\n\nOn their part, he said, the Muslims should preserve a strict silence on the issue of Ayodhya.\n\n\u201cIf the protection of the Babri Masjid was their responsibility, they have now discharged it by the sacrifices they have made. Now they have reached a point where there is very little else that they can do. As such, Muslims should consciously resolve to distance themselves entirely from this issue. Till now they have been forced to take up this cause, but henceforth they should leave it to the conscience of the nation,\u201d he said\n\nThe government of India, he said, should pass the Places of Worship Act in 1991, maintaining the status quo as on August 15, 1947, in order to guarantee the security of all places of worship (barring the Babri masjid).\n\nKhan had also embarked on a peace march through Maharashtra along with Acharya Muni Sushil Kumar and Swami Chidanand post the demolition of the Babri Masjid.\n\nIn 2003, he wrote another article saying it was about time Muslims devoted their energies to achieving a two-point formula of education and dawah. \u201cEducation will bring their succeeding generations into line with modern standards, and dawah work will provide them with a global mission through which they will be able to chalk out a proper line of action for themselves,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cMillions in India and other countries admired him for what he said. He basically wanted to bring people together, to forget past acrimonies, to start a new life\u2026forgiving was very important to him\u2026.that is what he preached..in every community there are hardliners\u2026they would like to extract their pound of flesh all the time\u2026but nothing deterred him,\u201d his son sai\n\nEarlier this year, the Narendra Modi government honoured him with the Padma Vibhushan award. A recipient of Padma Bhushan and the Rajiv Gandhi National Sadbhavna Award, he has authored some 200 books including a commentary and translation of the Quran in English, Hindi and Urdu. He was educated in a traditional seminary. In 1955, his first book \u2013 Naye Ahd Ke Darwaze Par, or On the Threshold of a New Era came out. He followed it up another one on Islam and Modern Challenges.\n\nHe edited a weekly publication of Jamiat Ulema Hind in the 1960s before starting his own venture Al-Risala in 1976. \u201cI don\u2019t think after him anybody would be able to carry it on\u2026.because the kind of message which he was able to convey\u2026lessons he was able to draw from smaller, simplest of things\u2026.it will be difficult to match,\u201d his son said. The monthly is published in Hindi and English.\n\n\u201cEvery article in Al Risala was written by him. From day one to his last day,\u201d he remembered. His book God Arises is part of the curricula of universities in over six Arab countries. It has been translated into various languages including English, Arabic, Malay, Turkish, Hindi, Malayalam and Sindhi. In the 1970s, he established the Islamic centre in Delhi. His other works include The Prophet of Peace: The Teachings of Prophet Muhammad, Jihad, Peace and Inter-Community Relations in Islam and The Ideology of Peace.\n\nSaddened by the passing away of Maulana Wahiduddin Khan.

It comes at a time when stakeholders in the theatrical business, especially down south were beginning to make some gains after incurring heavy losses for 10 months since last March last year. The filmmakers in the south showed the way by bringing out big guns and their risks paid off as it breathed a lease of new life in the theatre business.\n\nKrack\n\nRavi Teja\u2019s cop film came as a much-needed confidence boost to filmmakers down south. The film grossed more than Rs 12 crore worldwide on its opening day. Given that it was released on the heels of the Sankranti holiday, it further helped the box office prospects of the movie. And it ended its theatrical run with reportedly over Rs 70 crore, with a net profit of Rs 40 crore to its investors. That was a solid performance given the 50 percent cap on occupancy at the time.\n\nMaster\n\nIt was the biggest release of 2021 as it opened on 900 screens across the country. It was, in fact, a big experiment as stakeholders of the industry believed that the success or failure of the Vijay-starrer would decide the future course of big-budget, big star movies in all the languages. It released on January 13 to a lot of fanfare and celebrations and sort of warmed up the engines of the entertainment industry across the country. The film lifted box office gloom and the theatres, particular in the south, sprang back to life. The producers have not officially shared the total collection of Master. However, the trade estimates peg that the film may have collected over Rs 200 crore from its worldwide ticket sales.\n\nSulthan\n\nStarring Karthi in the lead role, the film further aided the box office recovery in Tamil Nadu. It faced stiff competition from major Hollywood tentpole Godzilla Vs Kong. The filmmakers have kept the total collection under the wraps. However, the stakeholders in the value chain appreciate the film for sustaining a strong momentum at the box office windows.\n\nKarnan\n\nDhanush was sort of relentless in bringing this movie to the theatres as he knew that it would add to the recovery of the theatre business. And he was right and how. Written and directed by Mari Selvaraj, the film opened to houseful shows and glowing reviews. On the eve of the film\u2019s release, the Tamil Nadu government withdrew permission for 100 per cent occupancy. And still, the filmmakers went through with the release as planned. Result: the film reportedly earned an impressive Rs 23 crore on its opening weekend. In its second week, the film\u2019s gross is pegged close to Rs 40 crore. While the producers have refrained from sharing the collection figures, they have simply declared the film a \u201cblockbuster.\u201d\n\nJathi Ratnalu\n\nTelugu film patrons continued to surprise everyone by thronging the cinema halls week after week. Do you think only big hero films could salvage the box office? Think again. This small-budget film starring a not-so-big star cast, made a dent at the box office. The film grossed a whopping Rs 70 crore, netting Rs 40 crore profits for its producers.\n\nUppena\n\nWritten and directed by Buchi Babu Sana, the film marked the acting debut of Panja Vaisshnav Tej and Krithi Shetty. A story about a star-crossed lover and the evils of caste pride, it had Vijay Sethupathi playing the main antagonist. Released during Valentine\u2019s week, the film exceeded the expectations in terms of theatrical collection. As per the trade experts, the film\u2019s gross collection has touched Rs 100 crore, earning a net profit of about Rs 57 crore for its producers.\n\nVakeel Saab\n\nThe film set the cash registers ringing at the box office across the Telugu states. If the second wave hadn\u2019t worsened, the film was well on its way to set a new record collection record for a Telugu film that was released in the middle of a pandemic. It raked in about Rs 100 crore in its first week. However, the night curfew in Telangana and the closure of theatres in the state owing to the curbs have massively affected its business. The trade believes that the film will add another Rs 20 crore to its kitty before it ends its theatrical run.\n\nThe Priest\n\nMalayalam superstar Mammootty\u2019s horror-thriller opened in cinemas at a time when the theatre business was gasping for new content to stay afloat in Kerala. The film surprised everyone by drawing the family crowd out of their house. Written and directed by Jofin T. Chacko, the film earned more than Rs 16 crore from ticket sales worldwide.\n\nRoberrt\n\nStarring Darshan in the lead, this textbook crowd-pleaser revived the box office business in all corners of Karnataka. Despite the growing concerns of Covid-19, the fans gave the film a rousing welcome at the box office.

(File)\n\nBarcelona president Joan Laporta maintained his support for the Super League on Thursday despite the quick exit of 10 of the 12 founding clubs in the breakaway competition.\n\nThe Super League, which provoked a backlash by other clubs, fans and authorities around Europe, was announced by a dozen top clubs in England, Spain and Italy on Sunday, but it quickly collapsed and is now officially backed only by Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n\n\u201cIt is absolutely necessary,\u201d Laporta said on Catalan public television in his first public comments on the project.\n\n\u201cThe biggest clubs create the most financial resources and we must have our say in deciding how the earnings are shared.\u201d\n\nThe six English clubs involved in the competition pulled out Tuesday amid escalating backlash from their supporters and warnings from the British government.\n\nA day later, Spanish club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and the three Italian teams in the project \u2014 Juventus, AC Milan and Inter Milan \u2014 also opted out.\n\nDespite being left nearly alone, Real Madrid president Florentino P\u00e9rez \u2014 the competition\u2019s supposed first chairman \u2014 said late Wednesday that the idea was not dead, but rather on standby.\n\nBoth Juventus and AC Milan left open the possibility of joining a Super League at a later date in their statements on Wednesday.\n\nBarcelona\u2019s finances have been hard hit by the pandemic, which has compounded problems in a budget that was already loaded by the highest payroll in soccer last season. Laporta\u2019s financial challenges include trying to convince Lionel Messi to sign a new contract when his expires this year.\n\nThe 12 elite clubs wanted to boost their revenues by cutting UEFA out of the equation and replacing the Champions League with the new tournament of 20 teams.\n\n\u201cThere have been pressures placed on some clubs, but the proposal is still standing,\u201d Laporta said.\n\n\u201cWe have very important investments, our salaries are very high, and those must be taken into consideration, along with sporting merits.\u201d\n\nBarcelona\u2019s participation was conditioned by Laporta\u2019s pledge to let the club\u2019s members vote on the proposal.\n\n\u201cWe are keeping a prudent stance,\u201d Laporta said.\n\n\u201cIt is a necessity, but our club members will have the final word.\u201d\n\nLaporta appeared open to tweaking the most controversial part of the project \u2014 locking in the 15 founding clubs and leaving only five berths open for other teams to join each season.\n\n\u201cIt has to be an attractive competition, based on merit won on the field,\u201d Laporta said.\n\n\u201cWe defend our national leagues and an open dialogue with UEFA.\u201d\n\nWhile Laporta spoke in Barcelona, the other Spanish league clubs not involved in the Super League project met via videoconference with league president Javier Tebas to form a common front against the new competition.

(AP File)\n\nUS President Joe Biden is preparing to formally acknowledge the Armenian Genocide, the systematic killing and deportation of hundreds of thousands of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire that occurred more than a century ago, US government officials told The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. According to an Associated Press report, lawmakers and Armenian-American activists have been lobbying Biden to make the announcement on or before Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, which will be marked on April 24.\n\nThe move could deteriorate the US\u2019s relations with Turkey and government officials told the AP that there was a possibility that Biden may just change his mind over the course of the next two days.\n\nWhat happened during the Armenian Genocide?\n\nWhile Turkey disagrees, the consensus among historians is that during the Armenian Genocide, between 1915 to 1922, in the First World War, thousands of Armenians perished due to killings, starvation and disease, when they were deported by Ottoman Turks from eastern Anatolia. It is difficult to estimate the total number of Armenians who died during the genocide, but the Armenian diaspora says that approximately 1.5 million died.\n\nTurkey rejects that number and claims that some 300,000 Armenians may have perished. The International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates that more than 1 million Armenians may have died.\n\nWhy is the acknowledgement significant?\n\nResearchers say that the acknowledgement by the US government would have little legal impact on Turkey, other than becoming a cause for embarrassment for the country and perhaps giving other countries the impetus to also acknowledge the genocide.\n\nSome researchers have asserted and drawn comparisons between the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide and this acknowledgement or wider acknowledgement of it in the international community may be unwelcome and unpalatable for Turkey.\n\nCountries including India, that have not formally recognised the Armenian Genocide have primarily adopted this stance in the interests of their wider foreign policy decisions and because of their geo-political interests in the region. According to the Armenian National Institute, an American non-profit organisation, 30 countries officially recognise the Armenian Genocide.\n\nWhat does this indicate about Biden\u2019s stance?\n\nThe US\u2019s move indicates that the White House has chosen to focus on one of Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign promises, which was officially recognising the Armenian Genocide.\n\nIn a 2019 letter to the Armenian National Committee of America, during the campaign for the US elections, Biden had stated: \u201cThe United States must reaffirm, once and for all, our record on the Armenian Genocide\u2026 If we do not fully acknowledge, commemorate, and teach our children about genocide, the words \u2018never again\u2019 lose their meaning. The facts must be as clear and as powerful for future generations as for those whose memories are seared by tragedy. Failing to remember or acknowledge the fact of a genocide only paves the way for future mass atrocities.\u201d\n\nAt that time, Biden had specifically omitted mentioning Turkey or the Ottoman Empire by name in his letter. Some critics had pointed out that while Biden had expressed support for recognising the Armenian Genocide as a senator, as Vice President in the Obama administration, he had not opposed Obama\u2019s refusal to recognise the genocide or the use of the term \u2018Meds Yeghern\u2019, meaning \u2018Great Crime\u2019 for the Armenian Genocide. There was also criticism that Biden had not specifically given a timeline that would explain the implementation of his plans.\n\nThere is more at play here: it isn\u2019t as though Biden\u2019s proposal has come as a surprise for observers. Turkey too has been anticipating such developments after Biden made promises on the campaign trail and then doubled down by making human rights a part of his foreign policy after becoming president.\n\nThere is some indication that many in the Armenian diaspora have not forgotten Obama\u2019s failure to deliver on his 2008 campaign pledge to recognise the Armenian genocide and are hoping that Biden won\u2019t follow in the former president\u2019s footsteps.\n\nInternally, within the Obama administration, there had been disappointment when he failed to recognise the genocide, with Samantha Power, who had served as United Nations ambassador under Obama and and deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes both publicly expressing their unhappiness with the president\u2019s decision.\n\nAt that time, observers had speculated that Obama\u2019s failure to deliver on his campaign pledge had been rooted in concerns about straining the US\u2019s relationship with Turkey, whose cooperation it had required on Washington D.C.\u2019s military and diplomatic interests in the Middle East, specifically in Afghanistan, Iran and Syria.\n\nHow has Turkey responded?\n\nIn an interview earlier this week, Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told Turkish broadcasting network Haberturk that such moves would only set back the already strained relationship between Washington D.C. and Ankara, both of whom are North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.\n\n\u201cStatements that have no legal binding will have no benefit, but they will harm ties,\u201d Cavusoglu had said in the Haberturk interview. \u201cIf the United States wants to worsen ties, the decision is theirs.\u201d\n\nWhile Turkey\u2019s President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan had shared a relatively friendly relationship with former US president Donald Trump, ties between the US and Turkey have been strained over a range of issues that include Turkey\u2019s purchase of Russian S-400 defence systems, foreign policy differences with regard to Syria, human rights and other intersecting legal issues. Although Turkey had been sanctioned by the US government under the Trump administration for its purchase of the Russian defence systems, the former US president had not questioned Erdo\u011fan\u2019s human rights records, which had helped reduce conflict between the two leaders.\n\nIn retaliation for recognising the Armenian Genocide, a New York Times report suggests that Turkey might to try to \u201cstymie or delay specific policies to aggravate the Biden administration, particularly in Syria, where Turkey\u2019s tenuous cease-fire with Russia has allowed for already-narrowing humanitarian access, and in the Black Sea, to which American warships must first pass through the Bosporus and the Dardanelles on support missions to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMore specifically, according to the New York Times report, Turkey could also slow non-NATO operations at Incirlik Air Base, located in Adana, that American forces use as a base and a station for equipment in the region. The report indicates that Turkey could engage in provocation that would result in new sanctions against the country or the reimposition of the ones that had been suspended. For instance, Turkey could initiate military action against Kurdish fighters allied with US forces in northeast Syria.\n\nAlso, more than three months into his presidency, Biden is yet to speak to Erdo\u011fan. Observers say that it is not clear when relations between the two leaders will improve. Last year during the campaigning for the 2020 US elections, in an interview with The New York Times, Biden had called Erdo\u011fan an \u201cautocrat\u201d, which had drawn criticism from Turkey.\n\nWhat is likely to happen?\n\nWhile the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the US would be symbolic, it would mean much for the Armenian diaspora. But there may be little that Turkey can really do in retaliation without jeopardizing its own interests.\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, Gonul Tol, director of the Turkish programme at the Middle East Institute in Washington, pointed to how Erdo\u011fan \u2019s leverage has diminished. Turkey\u2019s economy has also been suffering and a combination of these factors could result in a muted response from Erdo\u011fan. She also pointed to Biden\u2019s failure to actually implement plans.\n\n\u201cBiden has been vocal about human rights abuses in countries across the world, including in Turkey, but it hasn\u2019t gone very far beyond his rhetoric,\u201d Tol told the AP. \u201cThis is a chance for him to stand up on human rights with lower stakes.\u201d"},

The state was the first to include Covid-19 treatment in the list of illnesses covered under the state\u2019s flagship healthcare scheme just as the pandemic started last year.\n\n\u201cThese people were able to receive the best Covid-19 treatment for free at private hospitals under Arogyasri. In most cases the hospital bills paid by the government were more than the annual income of the affected person and his or her family,\u201d said Health Minister A K Krishna Srinivas. Till Thursday, 1,00,033 Covid-19 patients had received free treatment in various private hospitals across the state, under this scheme. The government has spent over Rs 309 crores to pay off the bills pertaining to these individuals. Under Arogyasri, economically and socially backward families receive free health care at listed hospitals, if the medical expense exceeds Rs 1,000.\n\nThe state government is providing free treatment at all government hospitals, and the private hospitals taken over by the government due to the pandemic, irrespective of whether or not the individual is eligible under Arogyasri. However, exclusively under the Arogyasri scheme, so far, 1,00,033 Covid-19 affected persons who chose to go to a private hospital not taken over by the government, have been treated. The scheme permitted some critically ill persons to receive treatment even at expensive hospitals such as Apollo Hospitals. In Nellore District, Manda Ramaiah (49) got admitted to Apollo Speciality Hospitals and his medical expenses of Rs 5,87,534 were paid by the state government through Arogyasri. Sheik Nazeer\u2019s bills of Rs 4,68,312 were also approved under the scheme. One of the main criteria to be eligible for enrolment in Arogyasri is that the family\u2019s income should be less than Rs 5 lakh per annum. Officials said that the huge hospital bills of Covid-19 patients would have brought financial ruin to such families as they would have had to spend an year\u2019s income on treatment if they were not eligible for free treatment. The state which brought down the number of positive cases to less than 50 in the second week of February is witnessing a huge resurgence in Covid-19 positive cases. On Thursday, the state reported 10,759 cases and 29 Covid-related deaths. The total number of cases in the state so far is 9,97,462.\n\nAlarmed at the drastic increase, a Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by the health minister discussed key issues in containing the virus, steps to be taken to bring down the number of cases, oxygen supply, testing, vaccination and shall present the recommendations to Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. The minister said that certain measures were taken to ensure that there is no shortage of oxygen or medicines in hospitals across the state, adding that the oxygen supply is in-line with the requirement level. Currently, the state needs 360 metric tons of oxygen and there is no problem for government hospitals, he said, adding that the Centre will provide assistance to set up a new oxygen plant in the state. He said that the government has been trying to complete the vaccination programme faster. So far, over 49 lakh people have been vaccinated in Andhra Pradesh. The minister also warned that strict action would be taken against private hospitals if they charge more than the prescribed prices and asked them to act humanely during the pandemic."},

The National Award-winning filmmaker fell unconscious at his residence in Chennai in March this year. After he was rushed to the hospital, the doctors found out that he had blood clots in his brain. On March 13, he died of cardiac arrest while he was still under medical care.\n\nJhananathan had carved a niche for himself in the industry by making socially conscious films that reflect on the evils of an unequal and casteist society.

The director\u2019s other notable works include the 2006 film E and the 2009 film Peranmai.\n\nLaabam was SP Jhananathan\u2019s second film with Vijay Sethupathi after Purampokku Engira Podhuvudamai in 2015.

(Express photo by Shuaib Masoodi)\n\nThe government recently announced that everyone above the age of 18 would be eligible for vaccination from May 1, the registration process for which will begin on April 28.\n\nAmid reports of some people contracting the virus even after getting vaccinated, medical experts have advised that one should continue to follow COVID-19 protocol even after the jab.\n\nThe Health Ministry has also issued some guidelines on COVID-19 vaccination. Similar guidelines have been laid down by World Health Organisation (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Take a look:\n\nCan a person with COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected) be vaccinated?\n\nThe Health Ministry says on its website that such people may increase the risk of spreading the virus to others at the vaccination site. \u201cFor this reason, infected individuals should defer vaccination for 14 days after symptoms resolution.\u201d\n\nIf I had COVID-19 and was treated, do I need to get vaccinated?\n\nIt is advisable to complete the COVID-19 vaccine schedule irrespective of past history of infection with COVID-19. \u201cThis will help in developing a strong immune response against the disease. Development of immunity or duration of protection after COVID-19 exposure is not established therefore it is recommended to receive vaccine even after COVID-19 infection. Wait for 4-8 weeks after recovery from COVID symptoms before getting the vaccine.\u201d\n\nWhen am I \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d?\n\nAccording to CDC, one can be considered \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine.\n\nAlso Read | Can you consume alcohol after getting a COVID vaccine?\n\nDo I need to wear a mask and take COVID-19 appropriate precautions after getting vaccinated?\n\nThe Health Ministry says, \u201cIt is absolutely necessary that everyone who has received the COVID-19 vaccine should continue to follow the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour i.e., mask, do gaj ki doori (social distancing) and hand sanitization to protect themselves and those around from spreading the infection.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first fourteen days after getting a vaccination, you do not have significant levels of protection, then it increases gradually. For a single-dose vaccine, immunity will generally occur two weeks after vaccination. For two-dose vaccines, both doses are needed to achieve are required to provide the highest level of best immunity possible,\u201d mentions WHO.\n\nCan I meet other people after I am fully vaccinated?\n\nCDC mentions that a person who is fully vaccinated can:\n\n*Visit inside a home or private setting without a mask with other fully vaccinated people of any age\n\n*Visit inside a home or private setting without a mask with one household of unvaccinated people who are not at risk for severe illness\n\nHowever, fully vaccinated people should not:\n\n*Visit indoors, without a mask, with people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19\n\n*Attend medium or large gatherings\n\nOne who is fully vaccinated should still watch out for symptoms of COVID-19, \u201cespecially if you\u2019ve been around someone who is sick. If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you should get tested and stay home and away from others.\u201d\n\nDo I need to take precautions at my workplace?\n\nThe CDC recommends that one should continue to take safety precautions at their workplace and follow the guidelines laid out by the organisation.\n\nCan I hug my kids/grandkids?\n\nOne who is vaccinated can hug their unvaccinated children or grandchildren who are all living in the same household and are not at high risk for severe disease, Namandje Bumpus, an expert in pharmacology and molecular science, mentions in an article on hopkinsmedicine.org.\n\nHow long will I remain protected against the virus after vaccination?\n\nThe longevity of the immune response is \u201cyet to be determined,\u201d mentions the Health Ministry. \u201cHence, continuing the use of masks, handwashing, physical distancing and other COVID-19 appropriate behaviours are strongly recommended.\u201d\n\nDoes the vaccination protect me against new strains?\n\nAccording to the Health Ministry, all vaccines are expected to provide \u201csome amount of protection\u201d against the mutated virus also. \u201cThe body responds to vaccination by making more than one type of antibodies to virus parts including spike protein\u2026Based on the available data the mutations as reported are unlikely to make the vaccine ineffective.\u201d\n\nAs research on the same continues, WHO advises that people should do everything possible to stop the spread of the virus in order to prevent mutations. \u201cThis means staying at least 1 metre away from others, covering a cough or sneeze in your elbow, frequently cleaning your hands, wearing a mask and avoiding poorly ventilated rooms or opening a window.\u201d"},

A large sum of money was taken from the complainant on the pretext of customs clearance for the gift at Delhi Airport, police said.\n\nLater, the complainant was asked to give more money in order to receive jewelry and foreign currency sent to her, police said. In as many as 207 transactions from two bank accounts, the complainant ended up transferring Rs 3,98,75,500 to online fraudsters for a plethora of pretexts given by the fraudsters to acquire her money, police said.

Gupta was narrowly confirmed by a vote of 51 to 49, with only one Republican breaking ranks to join the Democrats in approving her nomination.\n\n\u201cShe will bring a long overdue perspective to our federal law enforcement agency,\u201d Senate Majority Leader, Senator Chuck Schumer, said, pointing out that Gupta would also be the first woman of colour and civil rights attorney to serve in this post.\n\nIn a highly contentious confirmation process, Republican Senators were nearly unanimous in their opposition to Gupta\u2019s nomination. They argued that she was a \u201cradical\u201d nominee, and condemned her stance on a range of hot-button issues, like defunding the police and the legalisation of drugs.\n\nWho is Vanita Gupta?\n\nAfter graduating from New York University\u2019s School of Law in 2001, Vanita Gupta started her legal career at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. It was here that she rose to national prominence after she investigated a series of drug-related convictions and arrests of several men in Tulia, Texas. Almost all of the men convicted were black. She proved that the charges had all been fabricated by a narcotics agent named Tom Coleman. As a result of her case, 35 of the men were pardoned by the then-Governor of Texas, Rick Perry, in 2003.\n\nNewsletter | Click to get the day\u2019s best explainers in your inbox\n\nShe later joined the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) as a staff attorney, where she worked extensively to foster collaboration between law enforcement agencies, advocates, stakeholders and elected officials in an attempt to make the US\u2019 criminal justice system more effective. She later rose to serve as Deputy Legal Director and the Director of the Center for Justice at ACLU.\n\nIn 2014, she was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to serve as Acting Assistant Attorney General and head of the US Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division. Under the Obama administration, Gupta led several criminal and civil enforcement efforts to help protect the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals, victims of human trafficking and hate crimes, and also ensure voting rights for all, and equal opportunity in housing, employment and lending.\n\nUntil recently, she served as the Chief Executive Officer of the US\u2019 oldest civil rights coalition \u2014 The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.\n\nThe daughter of Indian immigrants, Gupta was born and raised in Philadelphia. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University. She is married to Chinh Q. Le, the Legal Director of the Legal Aid Society of the District of Columbia. The couple has two children.\n\nGupta\u2019s confirmation proceedings\n\nIn January, this year, President Joe Biden nominated Gupta as Associate Attorney General, the third highest ranking position at the Department of Justice (DOJ). He described the Indian American as \u201cone of the most respected civil rights lawyers in America.\u201d\n\nOpposing Gupta\u2019s nomination, a majority of Republicans called her a \u2018radical\u2019 candidate, arguing that she has long been critical of Republican lawmakers and has proven to be an \u201cextremely partisan advocate\u201d. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that Gupta had a \u201ca record of astoundingly radical positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s levied attacks on members of this body, and during the confirmation process, she employed the loosest possible interpretation of her oath to deliver honest testimony,\u201d he said. During her confirmation hearing, Gupta apologised for \u201charsh rhetoric\u201d she may have used in the past against Republican leaders.\n\nDespite the Republican Party\u2019s resistance, a number of prominent Conservative voices have backed her nomination. Last month, a group of anti-Trump conservatives launched a $1 million ad campaign in support of Gupta, the Washington Post reported. Conservative groups involved in criminal justice, such as Koch Industries and Grover Norquist, have also supported her, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s criticism of Gupta was largely centred around her work under the Obama administration. Despite Gupta repeatedly stating that she did not support calls to defund the police, Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, insisted that she did.\n\nOnly one Republican lawmaker, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, broke the ranks to support Gupta\u2019s nomination. She said that she chose to back Gupta following a lengthy conversation with her prior to the hearing. \u201cI am going to give the benefit of the doubt to a woman who I believe has demonstrated throughout her professional career to be deeply, deeply committed to matters of justice,\u201d Murkowski explained.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris was present at the procedural vote in case of a possible 50-50 tie, but her vote was not necessary after Mukowski decided to support Gupta.\n\nWhat are Gupta\u2019s duties as Associate Attorney General?\n\nAs Associate Attorney General of the US\u2019 Justice Department, Gupta will be in charge of the department\u2019s civil rights litigation as well as its antitrust, civil and environment divisions."},

(Express Photo by Jaipal Singh)\n\nWritteb by Chandrachur Singh\n\nUnprecedented times solicit unprecedented policy responses that are both innovative and effective. Given the rate of the spread of the coronavirus and its ravaging impacts, the need for innovative and participatory health management policies focussed on enabling basic access in healthcare is perhaps more profound and pertinent than ever.\n\nIt is in this context that an executive order issued by the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi directing district magistrates to tie up with Residents\u2019 Welfare Associations in setting up COVID-care facilities within their premises needs the widest possible appreciation. The initiative is significant given the fact that Delhi is likely to undergo a massive surge in positivity rates that even now are alarmingly high at 30 per cent. The impacts of the fourth wave of the pandemic are debilitating and have already categorically exposed the gaps in Delhi\u2019s health facilities and infrastructure.\n\nGiven that both the political class and citizens have been found lagging in adhering to COVID-appropriate behaviour, it is now futile to argue or to even to identify, where one or the other went wrong. Electoral outcomes in the times ahead may possibly be indicators of such a question. At this juncture, however, the most important focus should be on saving lives.\n\nIt is here that empowering RWAs to set up COVID care facilities makes sense. Being inherently flexible in their work styles and possessing a ground-based understanding of social facts and realities, they are the bodies that can easily bridge the moral distances between human and social capital or the \u2018self\u2019 and the \u2018other\u2019.\n\nRead | Vaccination of migrant workers must be prioritised\n\nMembers of RWA share mutuality and reciprocity in a social relationship for accomplishing socially common objectives. That said, it must be reiterated that the role and responsibilities of the civic associations should not be seen as an alternative to the state responsibilities. Instead, it should be seen working in concert or in coordination with the State.\n\nAllowing RWAs to set up COVID care facilities within their premises has distinct advantages.\n\nFirst, the exercise will be socially reinforcing in forging members into bonds of mutual love, respect, and appreciation. Almost all gated communities in urban settings have residents belonging to different professions, including medical professionals. And, naturally, such care units would not only gain from the human capital of their respective medical professionals but in so doing would easily flow into social capital by enhancing closer and personal interactions between patients and doctors in the given physical space \u2014 fusing rights into reciprocal duties, strengthening civic solidarities in the process.\n\nSecond, in so doing, the arrangements would certainly ease pressure on the hospitals allowing them to undertake not just necessary critical care functions but other day-to-day ailments as well. It is evident that even several highly-placed bureaucrats have found it an uphill task to get medical care once infected. Government hospitals come across as callous and private ones, even for many middle-class people, are out of reach.\n\nAdditionally, given the fact that the virus is now spreading to villages that do not have adequate medical facilities, it would allow hospitals to accommodate patients from such areas.\n\nThird, the RWAs already have a proven track record in handling the impacts of the initial waves of the pandemic. Recall that while the lockdown was enforced and a huge poor population was struggling to reach their villages, struggling to get food, it was the common people, the NGOs, the professionals who stepped up and gave help wherever they could.\n\nFourth, these associations could also chip in by adopting small clusters of people called domestic helpers who live in hutments around the gated communities and provide services and depend on them for their livelihood. The RWAs could undertake educative roles in allowing the underprivileged sections to develop an understanding of the disease and the basic protocol that should be followed.\n\nAdditionally, they could also be instrumental in putting these helpers in touch with the local government and party functionaries who are directly accountable to them, in case of infections so that a clear protocol of home quarantine or hospitalisation could be provided without too much hassle.\n\nIt goes without saying that these associations could easily generate resources to provide financial support to the most vulnerable sections in their fight against the virus by undertaking efforts for reskilling or upskilling their human capital and allowing them to get back on their feet.\n\nThe political class has been too callous in its attitude qua the pandemic. However, here is an opportunity, by opening itself to the social capital it might as well prove itself worthy of the trust citizens have placed on it.\n\nThe writer is an associate professor of Political Science at Hindu College, University of Delhi and a visiting professor at Kautilya School of Public Policy Hyderabad.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant will announce the software updates, codenamed Sky, at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference beginning June 7, the people said. They asked not to be identified discussing internal matters.\n\nApple rolls out major software updates for all of its key devices annually as a way to keep people glued to its ecosystem, sell more devices and encourage developers to create new apps. Apple typically releases the upgrades around September, near the launch of new iPhones. Given that WWDC is several weeks away, the company could still choose to alter features or delay them to a later update. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe company is planning a new feature that will allow users to set different notification preferences, such as if the phone makes a sound or not, depending on their current status. The enhancement will come in the form of a new menu that lets users select if they are driving, working, sleeping or custom categories of their choosing. The menu will be shown on the updated Lock Screen and in Control Center, the iPhone and iPad\u2019s menu for quickly accessing settings.\n\nThere will also be an option to set automatic replies to messages depending on their status. That will be an improvement over the current auto-reply feature, which is only currently available while driving. Apple has added some unique notifications features such as Do Not Disturb and Sleep Mode, but this will mark the first time the company offers a systemwide feature for changing notifications depending on a user\u2019s status.\n\nThe company is also working on upgrades to iMessage with the eventual goal of acting as more of a social network and better competing with Facebook Inc.\u2019s WhatsApp. Those changes are still early in development and could come later, the people said.\n\nThe iPad line, which gained new iPad Pro models earlier this week, will also see software changes. The company is planning the most significant update to the device\u2019s Home Screen since first launching the product in 2010. Following a similar feature for the iPhone introduced last year, Apple plans to let users place widgets \u2014 miniature apps that can display the weather, upcoming appointments, stock tickers and other data \u2014 anywhere on the Home Screen. Users will also be able to replace the entire app grid with only widgets.\n\nMore privacy protections are coming, too. One new feature in the works is a new menu that will show users which apps are silently collecting data about them. While Apple has increased the privacy of its devices in recent years, thousands of apps have been identified that use special trackers that can collect and share data such as phone numbers and location. The new feature is designed to cut down on that.\n\nApple is also planning a more minor update to macOS after its redesign last year, and updates to Apple Watch and Apple TV software."},

The state and the local administration eventually decided to use their services as institutional isolation centres at discounted rates.\n\nLast year, hotels were also used to isolate those returning from abroad on the Vande Bharat flights. The package deal saw hotels charging a discounted rate for three meals along with room rent.\n\nShetty said the model has restarted in the city as the demand for isolation beds has gone up. \u201cThis is a paid model for those who want to isolate themselves from home. These centres are run in accordance with the government rules and authorities keep a tab on the health of patients on a daily basis.

(Photo: Representational/ Pixabay)\n\nAfter a hectic day of work, it is only natural to want to unwind and transport yourself to your favourite destination with your favourite person. But since travelling is out of bounds, you turn to the next best option and turn on the diffuser or light up a scented candle which slowly spreads its magic and fills the room with a crisp fragrance that helps you relax and enjoy your \u2018me time\u2019.\n\nWelcome to that one hour of the day when aromatherapy helps you calm down and makes you feel relaxed with just one sensory pleasure \u2014 smell. With its roots in Ayurveda, aromatherapy derives its name from the word aroma, which means fragrance or smell and therapy which means treatment. The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy (NAHA) defines aromatherapy as \u201cthe therapeutic application or the medicinal use of aromatic substances (essential oils) for holistic healing\u201d.\n\n\u201cAyurveda is divided into eight branches and aromatherapy is mentioned in the Rasayana Tantra \u2013 the book of rejuvenation. This branch talks about healthcare and this is where aromatherapy is mentioned. So we can say aromatherapy is an extension of Ayurveda,\u201d said Blossom Kochchar, aromatherapist and founder, Blossom Kochhar Group of Companies.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Secret Alchemist (@secret.alchemist)\n\nAccording to market experts, the therapeutic procedure has seen a marked rise during the last year or so owing to pandemic-induced stress. As per Grand View Research, an India and US-based market research and consulting company, \u201cthe global essential oils market demand was estimated at 247.08 kilotons in 2020 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.5% from 2020 to 2027\u2033.\n\n\u201cYes, there is an increase in the sale of these products. People are just finally turning inwards. The pandemic has led people to think more about their well-being,\u201d said Sneh Pagrani, founder of Clay Essentials. Agreed Ankita Thadani, co-founder of Secret Alchemist who said that this therapy is a \u201cnatural way of healing a person\u2019s mind, body and soul\u201d. \u201cMany ancient civilizations like Egypt, China and India have used this as a popular complementary and alternative therapy for at least 6,000 years.\u201d\n\nAromatherapy is not only about the smell, it can also be practised through topical application. Whether it is massaging it on the pulse points to boost circulation or just applying it over your scalp \u2014 it has a holistic effect on your body.\n\nREAD | These essential oils will help you relax this weekend\n\nA mindful concoction\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by House Of Aroma (@houseofaromaindia)\n\nBut how does aromatherapy work? Explaining the science, Rashi Thakker, co-founder of House of Aroma, told indianexpress.com: \u201cOn inhaling essential oils, molecules of the oil pass through the nose and mouth to the lungs and from there to other parts of the body. As the molecules reach the brain, it stimulates the limbic system. The limbic system is a part of the brain that is linked to emotions, behavioural responses, blood pressure and respiration. In this way, essentials oils have a holistic effect on the body, moods and emotions.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to topical application of essential oils, the molecules of the oil are absorbed by the skin. Absorption can be enhanced by massaging the target area before applying the oil, which also leads to increased blood circulation.\n\nKochchar, however, pointed out, one cannot mix synthetic chemicals with essentials oils as it will end up spoiling the products. Agreed Thadani: \u201cAromatherapy oils need to be blended in the right proportions in glass beakers since they react with most other materials. Since essential oils are volatile in nature; storing them is extremely critical to maintaining their efficacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSunlight can accelerate the expiration of your essential oils. These UV rays destroy our skin cells in the same way that it degenerates the makeup of essential oils. Rapid oxidation alters the chemicals in essential oils, causing them to break down and be less effective,\u201c said Kochchar.\n\nMade with much thought and care, each essential oil used in aromatherapy has multiple unique benefits for the user. Some oils have a calming effect while some of the others create an invigorating sensation.\n\nREAD | The science behind why certain fragrances help us relax\n\nThe science behind\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Blossom Kochhar Aroma Magic (@aromamagicindia)\n\nIs it advised to practise aromatherapy during a particular season or time of the day to reap maximum benefits?\n\nPagrani said that while there is no best time to practise aromatherapy, \u201cit is important that we set an intention of what we want to achieve before starting this practice\u201d. For example, lavender oil has a very sedative, relaxing calming fragrance, and should be used in the bedroom in the evenings. One can even try rose and vetiver in the summer months as they are cooling and can be used in summers.\n\nAre there chances of one overdoing it? \u201cThere is no overdoing aromatherapy. It helps you stay connected with nature all the time and is a stress reliever while making sure you concentrate better,\u201d said Pooja Nagdev, founder of Inatur. \u201cYes, one can never overdo nature!\u201d Kochhar opined.\n\nBut, everything has a flipside as Thadani shared that disproportionate use of these oils\u2013 sniffing it for too long or inhaling too many blends at once \u2014 can cause headache or skin irritation. \u201cIn addition, the purity of essential oils plays a huge factor here. If any kind of synthetics is used to make the blends the effects could be way more adverse on individuals. It is advisable to keep a minimum of four hours of gap between using any blends,\u201d he advised.\n\nBut does it really work?\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Clay Curated Essentials (@clayessentials.in)\n\nDr Sunil Mittal, senior psychiatrist and chairperson of Cosmos Institute of Mental Health Behavioural Science said when it comes to serious mental disorders, \u201cresearch done over aromatherapy over the past two-three decades says it is still inconclusive.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to everyday problems like on days when you cannot sleep or are tensed and worried, then aromatherapy works\u201d.\n\nHe further explained research is carried out in the form of randomised controlled trials where \u201cthe principle of evidence-based medicine is studied and it shows that essential oils do not meet the criteria to be advocated as treatments for psychiatric disorders\u201d.\n\nHaving said that, aromatherapy can be considered as an adjunct additional therapy but it can never substitute anti-depressants or psychiatric medicines.\n\nA research paper titled Aromatherapy as an Adjuvant Treatment in Cancer Care \u2014 A Descriptive Systematic Review stated \u201cexisting evidence provides weak evidence that aromatherapy might have some short-term effects on anxiety and depression, and possibly on pain relief.\u201d But, Dr Mittal said, \u201cAromatherapy never helps cancer patients when it comes to depression but certainly helps in improving the quality of life by improving their sense of well-being.\u201d\n\n\u201cAromatherapy seeks to enhance an individual\u2019s physiological, emotional, cognitive, and psychological well-being. While aromatherapy will not \u2018cure\u2019 a health issue, it can help some people cope more easily with symptoms,\u201d concluded Thadani."},

This even includes audio from any media files that a user plays.\n\nYou can still choose to not share system sounds\n\nWhile the feature is now available, users will still have the choice to share their screen without the sound. If they wish to only share the screen like before and not any system sounds, users can simply choose to share their screens without sound.\n\nSupport for native system notifications on the way\n\nMicrosoft also recently confirmed that macOS users will also get native system notifications with Microsoft Teams in a future update. Native notification support began rolling out to Windows 10 users this month and the feature is expected to arrive soon on macOS soon as well.\n\nMicrosoft Teams on macOS currently uses its own notification system. This system is not fully integrated with Apple\u2019s own operating system. With native notifications, alerts from Microsoft Teams will show up in the macOS notification center alongside other messages.\n\nThere is no officially confirmed date for this update as of now. However, Microsoft has said it could come in April. Support for the new M1 chips is also unclear at this point."},

The oxygen manufacturer of the Chakan plant had apparently diverted oxygen to Buldhana on the directives of some bigwigs in the government, alleged government and civic officials.\n\nPCMC Deputy Municipal Commissioner Smita Zagade said Thursday the situation had turned scary last evening when the COVID Auto Cluster facility ran out of oxygen. \u201cThe hospital doctors told us the oxygen stock for one hour was available and that the life of patients was in danger\u2026\u201d she said.\n\nZagade said the Divisional Commissioner, PCMC commissioner and FDA officials then made all-out efforts to get the oxygen supply from different manufacturers in Pune district and outside. \u201cWe finally managed to get the supply from the contractor who had earlier refused to provide us the oxygen\u2026The oxygen tankers then landed up in the Auto Cluster facility by evening,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA panic situation had ensued as the hospital gave us very little time to act\u2026 I had almost come to the point of breaking down, it was a scary situation.

On Wednesday, when the Chakan plant manufacturer conveyed inability to supply oxygen, we faced a big crisis. We had to then turn the oxygen supply to patients who did not require it or required less of it. Oxygen supply to those COVID patients who were in the process of discharge was also turned off. Likewise, we took a number of steps to save on the consumption of oxygen. As a result the oxygen supply lasted a few hours and finally we got the supply around 10.30 in the night.\u201d\n\nDr Holkunde added,\u201dIf we had not used different techniques and ideas to save on the consumption of oxygen, anything could have happened. Yes, the depleting oxygen supply meant the lives of patients were in danger\u2026.But nothing untoward happened as the oxygen stock landed.\n\n\u2013 Stay updated with the latest Pune news.

However, the happy conversation soon turned bitter when one of her followers commented that she hadn\u2019t posted a tribute for Hina Khan\u2019s father. Hina\u2019s father passed away on April 20, after suffering a cardiac arrest. Gauahar, who herself lost her father last month, did not take the comment lightly and gave it back to the troll.\n\nAs soon as Gauahar read out the question, she looked visibly upset and angry. She first schooled the follower on how one doesn\u2019t need to express all their emotions on social media. Responding to the comment, the actor said, \u201cI am not a fake person to put it out only on social media. What I had to do, I did it. My connection with Hina is from my heart and I don\u2019t need to prove my connection to really silly people like you. So, please keep your negativity to yourself and don\u2019t bring it here. I am an individual and I take my decisions on a personal level. What I feel and how I feel, I react accordingly, and I will always do that .\u201d\n\nGauahar went on to add angrily, \u201cThoda sharam karlo yaar, besharam log (Have some shame)! I have her dad in my prayers, her in my prayers, and I don\u2019t need to prove anything to silly people like you, who only live your lives on social media and think just by putting a condolence on social media, you are feeling something, that\u2019s not true. When you feel, you feel. And, when you feel, you reach out to the person. You don\u2019t have to prove it to the \u2018janta\u2019 (public), understand..

Both of them bonded quite well on the show and were inseparable in the house. While Gauahar previously won the seventh season, Hina has been the runner up of Bigg Boss 11.\n\nAngry about being judged by nameless trolls, Gauahar further shared how people raised fingers at her for posting photos and videos of herself after her father\u2019s death. Calling them sick, the Ishaqzaade actor said, \u201cI lost my dad a month and a half ago and people were so quick to judge. \u2018Oh, you are already posting stuff. You are already putting pictures and dance videos.\u2019 Do you people even know what it takes to get over a loss? Do you know that a person doesn\u2019t need to sit like this and wonder \u2018Oh my God, I am losing somebody.\u2019 You can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nShe also reasoned her religious beliefs on the importance of moving on as she added, \u201cIn Islam, you can\u2019t grieve for more than three days. You can\u2019t cry and be in sadness for more than three days. You have to move on, you have to live your life, you have to carry on with the love of the person that you\u2019ve lost. So, you keep your judgements to yourself and let people be, the way they want to heal, the way they want to come out of things, the way they want to function, stop judging people. Live and let live.\u201d\n\nGauahar Khan shared that she wanted the live interaction to be a light and lovely one, however, that one comment got her fuming. Her fans soon tried to cheer her up by sending her love and positive messages, which definitely worked, as she got at replying to them with a smile.\n\nOn the work front, Gauahar was last seen in Tandav, and recently wrapped up production of her next, an anthology series Kaali Peeli Tales. The actor got married last year in December to actor-choreographer Zaid Darbar."},

Also, in these challenging times, we wish to reiterate what Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah has taught us through all these years \u2014 spread laughter and positivity even in times of adversity,\u201d he said, adding that even before the shoots were halted, the team\u2019s primary focus was to keep everyone safe. \u201cWhile work is important, health has become a priority in the last year. This is like a new life that has been given to us, and one has to keep it safe. We are also including real life situations and happenings in our storyline so that the audience also follows all protocols and stays safe,\u201d shared Asit Kumarr Modi.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by TMKOC_Neela Film Productions (@taarakmehtakaooltahchashmahnfp)\n\nAs he mentioned storyline and audience, we quizzed him on the recent flak the show has received from its fans. A section of the audience had claimed that over the years, the quality of Taarak Mehta had seen a decline. Refuting the same, the producer said that people are going through a tough time, and its getting harder for them to smile.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the show and its stories have degraded. People are in so much stress that they may not find these episodes funny but I am sure when they watch it after a few months, they would have a hearty laugh. Right now, everything is just too grim around us.\u201d Asit Modi also said that the team has been as passionate as it was from day one, and leaves no stones unturned to put out an entertaining episode. \u201cBut we are always open to criticism and if people would still feel that we are lacking, we will work hard. I am quite active on social media and also read each feedback and suggestions,\u201d he shared adding that people are also getting restless, and want to see Daya back and Popatal get married.\n\nAlso Read | Taarak Mehta Ka Chhota Chashmah a gift for kids during pandemic: Producer Asit Kumarr Modi\n\nDisha Vakani, who plays the role of Daya took a maternity leave in 2017, and is yet to get back even when the production has been in constant touch with her. While the buzz in industry suggest that her in-laws want her to focus on her family, others believe that Disha has asked for a mammoth hike.\n\nTrying to evade discussion around her comeback, Asit Kumarr Modi shared that the audience would get to see Daya\u2019s character in Taarak Mehta Ka Chhota Chashmah, the animated version of the sitcom. With a pause, he added, \u201cHonestly, the Covid-19 situation has made things more difficult. As much as the audience, even I want Disha to return as Daya, and I am hopeful she will. All said and done, I am thankful that the audience has been giving us equal love even in her absence, which is quite a boost.\u201d\n\nTaarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah airs on Sony SAB."},

(representational, getty images/file)\n\nBy Shivani Sikri\n\nThere are individual stages or ways in which young children evolve their vocal skills, and there is no one thumb rule. When you see other young kids of similar ages to yours or meet their parents, the differences between them can be highly contrasting. Although this isn\u2019t the best way to conclude your child\u2019s vocal development, as all children develop at their own pace, there are explicit milestones that you should keep in mind and keep a vigil.\n\nStuttering, inversion of letters, distorted words, even if the teacher has sounded the alarm on you, simply don\u2019t panic. You can consider meeting a speech-language therapist, that can help your child cope with specific difficulties.\n\nMy child does not speak well\n\nZozing, stammering, difficulty pronouncing certain letters (the R for example) or certain sounds (the ch becomes s or j), distorted words (the roar of \u201cr\u201d for a car): all these bad reflexes can be corrected in a few sessions. Often, it is the fact of still sucking his thumb or his pacifier that is in question: the speech therapist will mainly propose a work of positioning the tongue, in the form of games. In the event of a language delay (limited vocabulary, difficulty in constructing a sentence, etc.), the follow-up will be longer: the earlier you intervene, the better.\n\nHas a hoarse voice\n\nThis persistent voice disorder, called dysphonia, means your child shouts too much or uses their breathing improperly, straining their vocal cords. Rehabilitation sessions are recommended to make him work on his posture, his breathing, and help him have a more relaxing breath.\n\nHas trouble reading\n\nFrom the kindergarten section, we can notice that he does not associate a letter with a sound. In first grade, he stumbles on the syllables, jumps or confuses the letters (B and D for example), mixes up the words which are alike (fly / ladle), decipher with difficulty and does not understand what he reads? This is perhaps dyslexia . Techniques exist to treat this reading disorder and help the child develop compensation strategies. Many of them associate letters and sounds with shapes or images. Books and software can also facilitate learning. If other difficulties are associated, a complete follow-up with a psychomotor therapist and an occupational therapist is organised in order to prevent school failure.\n\nAlso Read | Five ways to help kids develop language skills at home\n\nTo allow you to see a little more clearly and to help you identify if a visit to the speech therapist would be beneficial for your little one, here are some indications (obviously this is not an exhaustive list.!). Refer to your child\u2019s age and see if the signs of difficulty noted below remind you of your child. If this is the case, it is strongly indicated that you start the process to meet a speech therapist.\n\nAt the age of 1:\n\nYour child does not babble or very little (ex: bababa, mamama).\n\nHe does not use sounds and gestures to signify his needs (ex: he is thirsty, he is tired, he wants to be picked up).\n\nDoesn\u2019t smile when his parents interact with him, doesn\u2019t care about them or watch them.\n\nDoes not respond to the call of his name.\n\nAt the age of 18 months:\n\nYour child does not use simple words like \u201cdaddy, mommy, blankie\u201d.\n\nAt the age of 2:\n\nYour child does not imitate your words and your games (eg noises of animals, gestures of a rhyme).\n\nYour child has a vocabulary of only a few simple words (usually around 50 words are expected).\n\nHe does not make sentences (ex: daddy gone).\n\nYour child does not ask questions (ex: What is it?)\n\nDoes not understand simple instructions. (ex: Give the ball. Show me your feet)\n\nAt the age of 3:\n\nYour child makes sentences of only 2 words.\n\nYour child has difficulty naming pictures or making a request.\n\nHe does not make himself understood by familiar adults other than his parents.\n\nYour child is unable to tell a well-known story or participate in a short conversation.\n\nHe has difficulty answering the questions \u201cwho\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d and \u201cwhere\u201d.\n\nAt the age of 4:\n\nYour child only makes short sentences of 2-3 words.\n\nHe has difficulty answering \u201cwhy\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d questions\n\nYour child has difficulty understanding longer instructions without help (eg: Go get your blue shoes in your room and bring them to the hall.)\n\nHe has difficulty understanding the concepts of space (ex: on, up, down, in)\n\nHe can\u2019t make himself understood by strangers.\n\nAt the age of 5,\n\nYour child has difficulty pronouncing sounds (at this age we still exclude the sounds \u201cch\u201d and \u201cj\u201d)\n\nYour child\u2019s sentences are missing little words such as determinants or pronouns (ex: he, she, it, they, etc )\n\nYour child has trouble matching the words in their sentences.\n\nYour child stutters when he talks.\n\nYour child has difficulty telling a story.\n\nHe has difficulty answering questions you ask him.\n\n(The writer is Chief Nutritionist & Co-founder at Nutri4Verve.)"},

Keeping your gut healthy at all times is extremely crucial. Here are six things you can do to improve your gut health, check it out here.\n\nBreathe\n\nThese are overwhelming times but one must remember that chronic stress can make things worse. \u201cAcute or chronic stress can weaken the response to the vaccine,\u201d added Dr Vishakha. Try doing calming exercises, practice meditation or even aromatherapy.\n\nAvoid smoking\n\nDon\u2019t smoke because this can reduce the antibody response to several vaccines. She suggests opting for a nicotine patch or gum, if absolutely necessary.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Dr Vishakha (@doctorvee)\n\nDo not consume alcohol\n\nAlcohol is harmful to one\u2019s health. It is advisable to stop consuming alcohol 3-4 days prior to getting vaccinated. This is because the same can weaken our response to the vaccine. \u201cAvoid alcohol 3 days before and after you get your shot. Also, avoid binge drinking 45 days prior to getting your dose,\u201d said the doctor.\n\nAdd zinc to your diet\n\nZinc is known to boost antibody response, so ensure that you include zinc in your diet at least two weeks prior to getting the dose. \u201cYou can also start taking a supplement or a shot prior to your shot,\u201d said Dr Vishakha, adding that it is present in animal protein, sprouts, legumes. Insufficient levels of zinc in your body can be bad for digestion and health, know more here.\n\nConsume protein\n\n\u201cProtein intake is crucial. Pay extra attention to your diet to ensure this. The elderly can be particularly deficient,\u201d mentioned the doctor. Here are great vegan protein sources for you.
