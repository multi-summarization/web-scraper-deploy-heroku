The two teams went up against each other four times last season include the first qualifier and the final. DC only came close to beating them in the first match. This time around, DC are led by Rishabh Pant who has won two out of three matches he has captained in the league. On the other hand, MI have also won two of their three games. They will take on each other at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chennai. On the Chennai wicket, the captain winning the toss is likely to beat first and then back his bowlers to defend the target.\n\nMI are unlikely to make any changes to their side even though Kiwi speedster Adam Milne was slightly expensive against Sunrisers Hyderabad in the previous game. Nathan Coulter-Nile is another bowler that can be tested by Rohit Sharma. On the other hand, Lukman Meriwala did not impress in his debut game and can be replaced by Amit Mishra considering Chennai wicket favours spinners. The absence of Anrich Nortje due to Covid-19 is still a concern for Pant as Kagiso Rabada has leaked runs in the two games he has played."},

As Peter Jackson brought a larger-than-life vision to our cinema screens in Lord of The Rings, it was also a win for motion capture technology. Serkis was to become synonymous with this technology but the duplicitous Gollum was where it all started for him.\n\nIn years to come, we would know him as a giant gorilla (King Kong), a genial bear (Baloo in Jungle Book), the rapidly evolving chimpanzee who will rule the earth (Caesar in War of Planet of the Apes) and a naval captain who loves the bottle as much as alliteration (Captain Haddock in The Adventures of Tintin). As Serkis turns 57 today, here\u2019s putting a spotlight on an actor whose best work is not simply \u2018acting\u2019 in the traditional sense, it is motion-capture acting.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate as to whether motion-capture should be recognised as a legitimate form of acting. When The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King swept the Oscars in 2004 (winning all the eleven categories in which it was nominated), many critics wondered if Andy Serkis should have been nominated in Best Actor or Best Supporting categories. They were of this opinion because his turn had been one of the most striking performances in the entire trilogy.\n\nThe actor himself revels in it. While promoting Tintin, he had said about being \u2018the man with no face\u2019, \u201cI see myself in every single character that I play\u2026 I may not be manifested on screen, but with every acting decision, and every in the moment beat, you\u2019re not just conveying a look, but also a thought and a feeling. You\u2019re embodying the character and giving soul to it.\u201d\n\nHere is a list of five best performances of Serkis\u2019 career. I have included both motion-capture and otherwise.\n\nGollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\n\nGollum, formerly a Hobbit who became corrupted due to the One Ring\u2019s influence, is easily Serkis\u2019 best known role. The character was fascinating and also provided much-needed humour when things got grim in the LOTR trilogy. The humour was due to Gollum\u2019s grammar (he keeps saying \u201cWe wants it\u201d regarding the One Ring) and his two perpetually warring personalities \u2013 one childlike, innocent and helpful, and the other greedy, murderous and evil. Most of the arc of his character in the story is about these two personas vying for control. To say that Andy Serkis gave life to Gollum would be the understatement of the century. Andy Serkis BECAME Gollum. Even without the CGI trappings of the character, Serkis was hardly distinguishable from his character. He crafted a convincing voice for Gollum that did not need any artificial manipulation. This was a driven, committed performance by a supremely talented actor.\n\nKing Kong in King Kong\n\nAfter LOTR trilogy, Serkis once again collaborated with Jackson in 2005\u2019s King Kong, an epic-length remake of the 1933 original. The film was long and felt so, but it was also consistently entertaining and Serkis, along with Jackson and his visual effects company Weta Digital, created a spectacular experience that has not aged even a bit.\n\nCaesar in the Planet of the Apes trilogy\n\nJust like Gollum, Serkis became Caesar in this film trilogy, portraying it first with playfulness as a child, then with a grim determination and a poignancy as the adult chimp. The performance was constantly spell-binding, and another showcase as to why motion-capture acting should be considered as acting.\n\nUlysses Klaue in Black Panther\n\nSerkis\u2019 range is not limited to just motion-capture, and his performance as the crazy, devilish villain Ulysses Klaue in Black Panther is a case in point. Although Klaue died too soon in the film, he anyway left a considerable impact on the moviegoers."},

He told reporters outside the palace gate that he hopes the king will heed the people\u2019s voices. More than 39,000 Malaysians have signed an online petition since March for the king to end the emergency.\n\n\u201cThis declaration of a state of emergency is not about fighting COVID-19. Not at all \u2026 it is about a weak government wanting to stay in power,\u201d Mahathir wrote on his blog earlier in the day.\n\nCritics said the emergency has failed to curb new infections, with Malaysia\u2019s total cases more than doubling to over 379,000 since January. Many also questioned why Parliament cannot resume since most restrictions have been lifted, with businesses, malls and schools reopened.\n\nIndonesia approves research of vaccine candidate Nusantara\n\nIndonesia has approved private research of COVID-19 vaccine candidate Nusantara that is backed by a former health minister, after recently saying a mid-stage trial for it could not proceed amid safety and data integrity issues.\n\nThe nod for private research comes amid mounting political pressure to approve the trial for the vaccine, which is backed by former minister Terawan Agus Putranto who enjoys the support of some in Indonesia\u2019s political and military elite. Some parliamentarians have even volunteered to provide blood samples and participate in the study in a show of support.\n\nBut Indonesian scientists and public health experts are worried this sets a wrong precedent for global pharmaceutical firms looking for opportunities to fast track their drugs.\n\nThe Nusantara vaccine uses a dendritic cell method commonly used in research for cancer treatment and is built upon immune cells drawn from patients\u2019 blood. BPOM chief Penny Lukito told Reuters that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed on Monday by the health minister, the drug regulator and the military chief of staff to allow the private research into the vaccine to be conducted at the Gatot Subroto Army Hospital in Jakarta."},

It is a general view in terms of the process we follow.\n\n\u201cWhen the government grants funds etc. under certain conditions that is also termed as government intervention.\u201d\n\nEarlier, the players feared if the current impasse is not resolved soon, South Africa may not been able to take part in the ICC T20 World Cup, to be held in India in October-November.\n\n\u201cAt a time when we should be enthusiastic about the future, we have to be concerned about the future (of the game),\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cThe Proteas Men\u2019s team has an ICC World T20 event in November. The current state of cricket administration undermines our preparation in this regard. It may even lead to our suspension from this event should the ICC decide to suspend South Africa.\u201d\n\nThe impasse between the Members\u2019 Council (MC) of CSA and its Interim Board (IB), which was expected to be resolved at a Special General Meeting (SGM) on Saturday, ended with a secret ballot by the MC that refused to accept long-standing proposals for amendments to its Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) to allow for a majority independent Board and an independent Chair.\n\nSports Minister Nathi Mthetwa has now indicated that he will step in to address the crisis, which has been going on for 18 months now, during which time almost all top executives and the Board at CSA either stepped down or were dismissed.\n\n\u201cGovernment intervention in the sport will have dire consequences, and the captains feel that this may lead to the ICC suspending South Africa.\n\n\u201cThe right to represent South Africa may be withdrawn and the ICC may suspend Cricket South Africa.\n\n\u201cThese outcomes will in turn impact touring, broadcast rights and sponsorship deals. Ultimately, the financial viability of the game will suffer and cricket at all levels will be severely prejudiced,\u201d the players said.\n\n\u201cThe Members\u2019 Council has now acted contrary to the wishes of the Minister, the Nicholson Recommendations, King IV Governance principles, and international best practice \u201chow can this be in the best interests of our game?\u201d the statement queried.\n\nThe crisis was exacerbated when, despite an initial ruling that other participants in the virtual meeting on Saturday, including the media, would have only observer status, the chairman allowed SASCOC Acting Chairman Barry Hendricks to address the meeting.\n\nHendricks advised the meeting against accepting the MOI because he said it first had to be sanctioned by SASCOC as the mother body for all sport in the country.\n\nHe also issued a veiled threat that without this, CSA risked losing its national colours and the participation of the Proteas women\u2019s squad, which has qualified for the Commonwealth Games, could be in jeopardy.\n\nCSA IB Chair Dr Stavros Nicolaou expressed his disappointment after the meeting."},

Fearing a big loss in revenue, many producers are withholding their films,\u201d Subramaniam added.\n\nThe second wave has hit the country at a time when the Tamil film industry was bustling with a lot of energy. In the last four months, a few big films had revived the box office business in Tamil Nadu, which suffered considerably following the Covid-induced lockdown last March. It was Vijay\u2019s Master in January, which drew the crowd out of their homes in massive numbers. Theatres made up for the 50 per cent cap on the occupancy by running extra shows and early morning fan shows. And 10 days after its initial release, the film was already in the profit zone. The momentum at the box office was sustained by Godzilla vs. Kong, which came out in March. And Karthi\u2019s Sultan also did solid business as theatres had the permission to function with full occupancy by then.\n\nAnd on April 9, Dhanush\u2019s Karnan hit screens. The hard-hitting film became a top choice for the audience in Tamil Nadu, and it even made good gains in overseas markets. By the end of the first week, the film was declared a blockbuster. \u201cKarnan did a very good business. In distribution circles, none of them incurred the loss,\u201d said Subramaniam.\n\nWith new restrictions in place, many filmmakers have already postponed the release of their films in April. Thalaivi, starring Kangana Ranaut and Arvind Swami, was due in cinemas on April 23. However, the filmmakers withheld its release citing rising Covid-19 cases. So did the makers of MGR Magan, starring Sasikumar and Sathyaraj. And the delay in releasing new films will cause a box office draught once again.\n\n\u201cProducers of films like Doctor and Kodiyil Oruvan are waiting to release their films. But, they will release only after the government allows regular shows and relaxes other restrictions,\u201d added Subramaniam.\n\nUnlike last time, the distributors and exhibitors are more emotionally sorted in handling the crisis as they understand the predicament of the producers as well. \u201cAlso, only when we run shows properly in full swing, we can approach the producers to release their films,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, Tirupur Subramaniam is also confident that the producers would rather wait and release the film in theatres, instead of taking their films to streaming platforms. \u201cI don\u2019t think the producers will go directly to OTT platforms this time. The success of Master and Karnan has given them confidence. They have realized that if they want their movies to make big collections, then they have to stick to theatrical release,\u201d he concluded."},

Fearing a big loss in revenue, many producers are withholding their films,\u201d Subramaniam added.\n\nThe second wave has hit the country at a time when the Tamil film industry was bustling with a lot of energy. In the last four months, a few big films had revived the box office business in Tamil Nadu, which suffered considerably following the Covid-induced lockdown last March. It was Vijay\u2019s Master in January, which drew the crowd out of their homes in massive numbers. Theatres made up for the 50 per cent cap on the occupancy by running extra shows and early morning fan shows. And 10 days after its initial release, the film was already in the profit zone. The momentum at the box office was sustained by Godzilla vs. Kong, which came out in March. And Karthi\u2019s Sultan also did solid business as theatres had the permission to function with full occupancy by then.\n\nAnd on April 9, Dhanush\u2019s Karnan hit screens. The hard-hitting film became a top choice for the audience in Tamil Nadu, and it even made good gains in overseas markets. By the end of the first week, the film was declared a blockbuster. \u201cKarnan did a very good business. In distribution circles, none of them incurred the loss,\u201d said Subramaniam.\n\nWith new restrictions in place, many filmmakers have already postponed the release of their films in April. Thalaivi, starring Kangana Ranaut and Arvind Swami, was due in cinemas on April 23. However, the filmmakers withheld its release citing rising Covid-19 cases. So did the makers of MGR Magan, starring Sasikumar and Sathyaraj. And the delay in releasing new films will cause a box office draught once again.\n\n\u201cProducers of films like Doctor and Kodiyil Oruvan are waiting to release their films. But, they will release only after the government allows regular shows and relaxes other restrictions,\u201d added Subramaniam.\n\nUnlike last time, the distributors and exhibitors are more emotionally sorted in handling the crisis as they understand the predicament of the producers as well. \u201cAlso, only when we run shows properly in full swing, we can approach the producers to release their films,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, Tirupur Subramaniam is also confident that the producers would rather wait and release the film in theatres, instead of taking their films to streaming platforms. \u201cI don\u2019t think the producers will go directly to OTT platforms this time. The success of Master and Karnan has given them confidence. They have realized that if they want their movies to make big collections, then they have to stick to theatrical release,\u201d he concluded."},

He said on Tuesday, \u201cYesterday I came at 9.30 am but there were so many people that I could not get the test done. Today I came at 7.40 am, but the first 100 slots were already taken, so I had to come by noon again.\u201d\n\nWith flu-like symptoms and a fever, he said he wanted to check if he had Covid, even though he has got both doses of the vaccine.\n\nDr D K Sharma, the medical superintendent at AIIMS, said, \u201cWhen the case load had reduced, we were getting 20-25 people \u2014 healthcare workers or their dependents \u2014 tested daily, now we are testing around 250. It has been a significant increase, but we have also increased the working hours of people.\u201d\n\nA dialysis technician working at the Max Hospital, Saket, said he had to get tested at Charak Palika Hospital in Moti Bagh as slots at his hospital were not available. The 30-year-old said, \u201cI have had a fever since yesterday, and even though I am vaccinated, I worked for six days in the Covid ward so I want to check. There is no slot available anywhere; even at private hospitals there are long queues.\u201d\n\nResident doctors conducting tests said they are working overtime but still finding themselves overwhelmed.\n\nThe Delhi government had recently pulled up testing facilities for collecting more samples than they could process, leading to a long wait for results.\n\nOn Tuesday, patients at Primus Multispeciality Hospital in Chanakyapuri also said they had to wait more than an hour in the queue. Said a 56-year-old homemaker who came with her 20-year-old daughter: \u201cI came from Faridabad as there is too much rush there at the centres there.\u201d The MS of the hospital, Dr Subodh, said that due to the increased rush, waiting time is between two and three hours."},

The synthesis and manufacture of the IMDG component has been successfully indigenized and will be manufactured at commercial scale within the country. This is the first instance where a novel adjuvant has been commercialised in India.\n\nThe protocols for manufacturing, testing and release of inactivated vaccines have been tried, tested and validated across several of our vaccines, these also meet the requirements of WHO, Indian and other regulatory authorities. These protocols have delivered consistent results over a 15-year period with more than 300 million doses supplied globally, with excellent safety and performance record, an official statement issued today has said."},

We did a few events there, one with Karan Johar, we went to the literature festival in Dehradun, did an event with Barkha Dutt, went to Poona, did a closed-door event there, came to Bombay, then went back to Delhi, then went to Baroda, back to Delhi, then Bombay again,\u201d said Sheela.\n\nDirector Shakun Batra, who is executive-producing the documentary, said that contrary to popular opinion, Searching for Sheela was made not because another Netflix doc about the Osho experience was a runaway hit. \u201cYou\u2019re exploring society, you\u2019re exploring her (Ma Anand Sheela) as a pop-culture phenomenon, and then the layers get deeper and more interesting and that\u2019s why this homecoming project is important. It\u2019s not, \u2018Oh let\u2019s get further because Wild Wild Country was a hit.\u2019 No, let\u2019s see who we are as much as we want to know who she is,\u201d concluded Shakun Batra.\n\nSearching for Sheela will premiere on Netflix on April 22."},

(AP Photo)\n\nLast month, US President Joe Biden unveiled his $2 trillion infrastructure plan, promising to fight climate change and create new jobs in the process. Republicans have called it the Green New Deal, however it only takes in certain elements from the GND, a \u201cCongressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change\u201d.\n\nUS Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been the champion in leading the Green New Deal and introduced the first proposals two years back, criticised Biden\u2019s plan saying it is \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d. She told NPR that while she was happy to see ideas from the GND being adopted, spending needs to address climate change have to be increased. The latest version of her GND is expected to be re-introduced in the US Congress this week with an expanded scope that looks at lead in city water and pollution in low-income economies.\n\nWhat is the Green New Deal?\n\nIn response to the Great Depression, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced a \u2018New Deal\u2019 which included social and economic reforms and public works projects. Taking inspiration, the GND calls for public policy proposals to address climate change, increase investment in renewable energy and resource efficiency, combining Roosevelt\u2019s economic approach to create jobs and reduce economic inequality.\n\nGND was central to the Green Party presidential campaign of Jill Stein in 2016 and has been part of the US Green Party\u2019s platform for over a decade. Bernie Sanders\u2019s 2016 campaign also included a GND.\n\nDemocrats acknowledged climate change but didn\u2019t have a concrete plan to address the issue. In November 2018, an environmental group called the Sunrise Movement organised a sit-in in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office demanding a congressional committee to address the environmental crisis. A group of Democrats then worked together with Sunrise and created a proposal for a Select Committee on a Green New Deal.\n\nIn February 2019, Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward Markey released a 14-page resolution for the Green New Deal. At present, the Green New Deal is a resolution: a roadmap for what America needs to do to address climate change and avoid a global catastrophe. It is best described as a plan for policy changes.\n\nThe resolution says the US must take a leading role in reducing emissions, the main goal is to reduce America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2030 along with creating jobs, establishing universal healthcare, high minimum wages and integrating the US through public transport.\n\nThe prime goal is to decarbonise the economy by reducing carbon emissions to net-zero by switching to 100 percent renewable energy sources. This includes improvements to the public transport network to include more electric vehicles, and also investments in making the network more dense. It aims to possibly ban the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2030.\n\nAccording to reports, buildings in the US produce 40 per cent of the country\u2019s annual carbon emissions. Proposals aim to reduce emissions by implementing a zero-carbon standard for new buildings and funding for retrofitting of existing buildings that are dependent on natural gas for heating and cooling.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry employs a large number of people and overhauling those industries would leave people without jobs especially in rural areas. This is why for any new deal, job creation will have to be at the core as it aims to transform the economy and public sector by creating jobs for the lower and middle classes. It would involve investment of trillions of dollars and federal job guarantees.\n\nThese jobs will also give voters an opportunity to recognise climate change and do their part for the earth, making the GND a transformational economic policy. The GND wants to make sure that no-one is left behind and hence want to offer protections for people worst hit by historical discrimination \u2014 low income communities, people of colour and indigenous communities.\n\nWho all support it?\n\nWith the Republican Party largely denying climate change and hesitant on taking action, most supporters are from a progressive wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nOver 100 US Congress members support the GND, various US senators including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and even world leaders such as former US vice-president Al Gore and former UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon have publicly expressed support. Vice-President Kamala Harris was also a co-sponsor of the bill.\n\nIt has found widespread support in climate change organisations. In January 2019, over 600 organisations wrote to the US Congress calling for policies to reduce greenhouse emissions. Over 300 local elected officials across 40 US states have also issued letters endorsing the Green New Deal. The Yale Program on Climate Change Communication released a poll data that said GND has strong bi-partisan support among voters.\n\nWhat is the criticism against the GND?\n\nRepublicans say the plan would devastate the economy and lead to tax increases wth the fossil fuel industries witnessing huge job losses.\n\nMore rational critics argue that the 2030 goal is too optimistic and a more realistic one would be 2045 or 2050. There are questions about financing the plan that have been raised by Republicans and Democrats alike. Without a concrete funding and investment strategy, the plan is unlikely to pass in either houses especially since Democrats hold only a small majority in both.\n\nNewsletter | Click to get the day\u2019s best explainers in your inbox\n\nOcasio-Cortez in CBS\u2019s 60 minutes said, \u201cPeople are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes\u201d that will contribute to the GND and has suggested tax rates of upto 60% \u2013 70% for the ultra-rich.\n\nBiden vs. GND\n\nDuring the first US Presidential Debate in 2020, Biden said he didn\u2019t support the GND, but in his climate change plan, the GND will pay for itself.\n\nWhile the GND hasn\u2019t released an estimated cost, it is likely much higher than Biden\u2019s $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. The spending will take place over a course of eight years and to offset the costs, Biden\u2019s plan also proposes tax increases, especially tax revenues on multinationals over a period of 15 years.\n\nJust as in the GND, Biden\u2019s plan will accelerate actions against climate change by adopting renewable and cleaner energy sources and promote racial equality in the economy. It would also improve broadband services, drinking water and commute times.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 whereas the GND sets it a slightly unrealistic 2030. The bill aims to launch a Climate Conservation Corps which will employ people to conserve public lands, it also sets to expand the US electric vehicle market.\n\nIt will also increase spending in R&D and training a new workforce, an idea strongly highlighted in the GND. It shares the same principles with GND when it comes to providing minimum wage to employees, benefits, and freedom to join unions, it doesn\u2019t speak of universal-health care.\n\nThe plan is yet to be passed in both houses of the Congress to be signed into a law. In the House, Democrats hold a small majority but only a razor thin majority in the Senate, with Democratic Vice-President breaking the 50-50 vote."},

As per the report, 87 countries are now electoral autocracies and home to 68 per cent of the global population.\n\nApart from this, the report also pointed to an accelerated autocratisation in several countries including G-20 nation-states United States, Brazil and Turkey that has hastened the decline of democracy globally. Liberal democracies, the report says, have diminished and now constitute only 14 per cent of people.\n\nThe report says that with the backsliding of democracy in Asia-Pacific region, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, the level of democracy enjoyed by the average global citizen in 2020 is down to levels last found around 1990.\n\nThis decline in democracy, the report says, is part of the \u201cthird wave of autocratisation\u201d \u2013 25 countries, home to 34% of the world\u2019s population (2.6 billion people), are in democratic decline by 2020. At the same time, the number of democratising countries have dropped by almost half down to 16 that are home to a mere 4 per cent of the global population.\n\nWhat are the waves of democratisation?\n\nThe concept \u2018Democracy Wave\u2019 was first introduced by the American political scientist Samuel P Huntington in his book \u2018The Third Wave\u2019 in 1991. In the book, he writes that since the early nineteenth century, there have been three major surges of democracy as a political system and two brief periods of decline. He calls these surges as \u2018waves of democracy\u2019 and the ebbs as the \u2018reverse waves.\u2019\n\nAs per Huntington, the first \u2018long\u2019 wave of democratisation began in the 1820s, with the widening of the suffrage to a large proportion of the male population in the United States, and continued for almost a century until 1926, bringing into being some 29 democracies including France, Britain, Canada, Australia, Italy and Argentina.\n\nHe argues that this \u2018long and slow wave\u2019 was followed by a \u2018reverse wave\u2019 leading to the weakening of the democratisation process. Between Mussolini\u2019s rise to power in 1922 and 1942, the number of democratic states in the world was brought down to a mere 12.\n\nThe triumph of the Allied Forces in World War II initiated a second wave of democratisation taking the number of democratic countries to 36 by 1962. This, says Huntington in the book, was followed by a second reverse wave (1960-1975) that brought the number of democracies back down to 30.\n\nThe third wave of democratisation, Huntington proposes, began with the Carnation revolution in Portugal in 1974 and continued with a number of democratic transitions in Latin America in the 1980s, Asia Pacific countries and, saliently, in Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He points out that this democratic wave was so strong in Latin America that out of 20 countries in the continent, only two countries (Cuba and Haiti) remained authoritarian by 1995.\n\nIn 1991, when he published the book, he observed that signs of the commencement of a third reverse wave were already there, with nascent democracies like Haiti, Sudan returning to authoritarianism.\n\nWhat are waves of Autocratisation?\n\nFollowing Huntington\u2019s lead, a number of political scientists have used these concepts to explain the ebbs and flows in the march of democracy.\n\nFor example, in March 2019, Anna L\u00fchrmann and Staffan I. Lindberg published a research article, \u2018A third wave of autocratisation is here: what is new about it?\u2019 in which they mapped the strengthening and weakening of democracies across the globe in over a century and \u2018identified\u2019 a distinct third wave of autocratisation that commenced in 1994.\n\nThey used V-Dem\u2019s data on 182 countries from 1900 to the end of 2017 (or 18,031 country-years ) to demonstrate a third wave of autocratisation. They did this by identifying a total of 217 \u2018autocritisation episodes\u2019 in 109 countries from 1900 to 2017.\n\nThe three waves of autocratisation as mapped by Anna L\u00fchrmann and Staffan I. Lindberg. (Source: research paper by Anna L\u00fchrmann and Staffan I. Lindberg) The three waves of autocratisation as mapped by Anna L\u00fchrmann and Staffan I. Lindberg. (Source: research paper by Anna L\u00fchrmann and Staffan I. Lindberg)\n\nThe dates for the first two reverse waves presented by them are very similar to Huntington\u2019s despite the conceptual and measurement differences. As per them, during the first reverse wave 1922\u20131942 a total of 32 autocratisation episodes took place; they identified 62 episodes in the second reverse wave between 1960\u20131975; during the ongoing \u2018third wave\u2019 of autocratisation they located 75 episodes starting from 1942 (until 2019).\n\n\u201cBy 2017, the third wave of autocratisation dominated with the reversals outnumbering the countries making progress. This had not occurred since 1940,\u201d they say in the paper.\n\n\u201cIn sum, an important characteristic of the third wave of autocratisation is unprecedented: It mainly affects democracies \u2013 and not electoral autocracies as the earlier period \u2013 and this occurs while the global level of democracy is close to an all-time high. Hence, for now at least, the trend is manifest, but less dramatic than some claim,\u201d they say.\n\nAuotocratisation has become less dramatic\n\nPolitical scientists like Micheal Coppedge note that a key contemporary pattern of autocratisation is the gradual concentration of power in the executive, apart from the more \u201cclassical\u201d path of intensified repression.\n\nLarry Diamond, another American political scientist sees the decade 2006 to 2016 as that of an incipient decline in democracy bringing in instability and stagnation among democracies. As per him, the decade brought an incremental decline of \u2018grey-zone democracy\u2019 (which defy easy classification as to whether or not they are democracies), deepened authoritarianism in the non-democracies, and caused decline in functioning and self-confidence of the established, rich democracies.\n\nAlthough various observers including V-Dem, Freedom House, point to substantial autocratisation over the last decade in countries as diverse as the United States, India, Russia, Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, the democratic breakdowns have become less conspicuous. This, political scientists say, is because the contemporary autocrats have \u201cmastered the art of subverting electoral standards without breaking their democratic fa\u00e7ade completely.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocratic breakdowns used to be rather sudden events \u2013 for instance, military coups \u2013 and relatively easy to identify empirically. Now, multi-party regimes slowly become less meaningful in practice making it increasingly difficult to pinpoint the end of democracy,\u201d pinpoint Luhrmann and Lindberg in the article mentioned earlier.\n\n\u201cA gradual transition into electoral authoritarianism is more difficult to pinpoint than a clear violation of democratic standards, and provides fewer opportunities for domestic and international opposition. Electoral autocrats secure their competitive advantage through subtler tactics such as censoring and harassing the media, restricting civil society and political parties and undermining the autonomy of election management bodies. Aspiring autocrats learn from each other and are seemingly borrowing tactics perceived to be less risky than abolishing multi-party elections altogether,\u201d they argue.\n\nAs per Luhrmann and Lindberg, the \u2018erosion model\u2019 has emerged as the prominent tactic in the third wave of autocratisation. The first and second waves, on the other hand, were dominated by blatant methods such as military coups, foreign invasions or abolishment of the key democratic institutions by a legally elected officer.\n\n\u201cDemocratic erosion became the modal tactic during the third wave of autocratisation. Here, incumbents legally access power and then gradually, but substantially, undermine democratic norms without abolishing key democratic institutions. Such processes account for 70 per cent in the third reversal wave with prominent cases of such gradual deterioration in Hungary and Poland. Aspiring autocrats have clearly found a new set of tools to stay in power, and that news has spread,\u201d write Luhrmann and Lindberg.\n\nThe \u2018Third Wave\u2019 accelerates\n\nAs per the latest V-DEM report, in 2020, the third wave of autocratisation has accelerated considerably. \u201c\u2026It now engulfs 25 countries and 34 per cent of the world population (2.6 billion). Over the last ten years the number of democratizing countries dropped by almost half to 16, hosting a mere 4 per cent of the global population,\u201d says the report.\n\nThe Third Wave by Samuel P Huntington\n\nA third wave of autocratization is here: what is new about it? by Anna L\u00fchrmann & Staffan I.

It depicted the leader sitting naked on a golden toilet, golden toilet brush in hand, with a bottle of cleaning agent labeled \u201cNovichok\u201d beside him. A nearby protest banner, meanwhile, accused Putin of being a \u201cMurderer, Thief, Dictator.\u201d Protesters had turned out to show their solidarity with jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny \u2014 and mock Putin\u2019s gargantuan Black Sea luxury villa.\n\nThe next day, Czech prime minister Andrej Babis announced that two major 2014 explosions at a munition depot in the country\u2019s southeast which left two dead had been traced back to Russian operatives. He said the blasts had been conducted by Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence service. Czech authorities proceeded to expel 18 Russian diplomats. Authorities also called for the arrest of two GRU agents suspected of involvement in the 2014 explosions. They are the same two men involved in the 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in London.\n\nThe Russian government dismissed the accusations, with the foreign ministry branding them \u201cabsurd.\u201d In a tit for tat move, Russia expelled 20 Czech diplomats \u2014 almost its entire embassy staff.\n\nAct of aggression \u2013\n\nRevelations surrounding the 2014 blasts sparked outrage and a veritable political earthquake in the Czech Republic. Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, who is also the country\u2019s acting foreign minister, called off a scheduled visit to Moscow where he had planned to discuss a deal to buy the Russian Sputnik V vaccine. High-ranking opposition lawmakers, among them Civic Democratic Party (ODS) leader Petr Fiala, called Putin\u2019s actions \u201cRussian state terrorism.\u201d And Prime Minister Babis announced he would discuss how to proceed against Russia with EU and NATO officials.\n\nMedia pundits and political analysts agree this is a grave affair. Indeed, Jakub Janda of the European Values Center for Security Policy, a Prague-based think tank, told DW the bombings mark the \u201cmost hostile attack on Czech territory since the Soviet invasion of 1968.\u201d\n\nRussian troll factories, mafia \u2013\n\nJiri Pehe, a political analyst and former advisor to former President Vaclav Havel, argues referring to Russian conduct as \u201cstate terrorism\u201d is justified. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he says, \u201cRussia\u2019s hostile activities in the Czech Republic go well beyond these actions.\u201d Pehe says \u201cthousands of Russian \u2018business people\u2019 work for the Russian state, troll factories and the Russian mafia.\u201d He says the Russian embassy in Prague is completely oversized, with a staff over more than 100 people. \u201cWe don\u2018t know what half of them actually do.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Czech government claims to have \u201chard evidence\u201d Russian GRU agents conducted the October and December 2014 blasts at the Vrbetice arms depot, certain aspects of the affair remain shrouded in mystery.\n\nIt was by mistake that the weapons and munitions in question exploded on Czech soil. Apparently, they were destined for export to Ukraine or Syria, a deal the Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev was meant to handle. In April 2015 he was poisoned and barely survived. It later emerged the Russian GRU was responsible for the attack.\n\nClear timing \u2013\n\nCzech media outlets have speculated over the timing of the ammunition depot explosion revelations. One thing, meanwhile, is for certain. Czech foreign policy will be not be same after this.\n\nThe EU state is deeply divided over its relationship with Moscow. President Milos Zeman, ridiculed by some commentators as \u201cRussia\u2019s Prague ambassador\u201d polarizes opinions. He has recognized the Crimean Peninsula as a \u201cRussian territory,\u201d saying that Ukraine should now be compensated with Russian oil and gas.\n\nZeman under pressure \u2013\n\nPresident Zeman\u2019s office announced he will comment on the delicate affair next Sunday. \u201cThis shows that the feels under pressure and has lost his political footing,\u201d says Jiri Pehe. The calls for him to be sacked are increasing, says Pehe, as \u201crumors exist according to which he knew about the details of the Vrbetice explosions and tried to sabotage the work of the Czech intelligence domestic security agency, BIS.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s Social Democrats \u2014 a junior coalition partner in the government alliance \u2014 are divided over Russia. Party leader Jan Hamacek recently dismissed his fellow party member Tomas Petricek from his job as foreign minister due to his cautious stance toward Russia and refusal to buy the Sputnik V vaccine.\n\nBabis changes tack \u2013\n\nPrime Minister Andrej Babis, of the populist ANO party, has urged his country to maintain economic ties with Russia \u2014 while avoiding Zeman\u2019s overtly pro-Russian stance. Babis has carefully weighed his words when commenting on the 2014 blasts. Unlike the opposition, he has avoided talking of \u201cRussian state terrorism.\u201d\n\nBut with parliamentary elections coming up in a few months\u2019 time, he simply cannot remain silent on the issue. He must position himself, or risk seriously undermining his party\u2019s electoral chances.\n\nEconomic fallout \u2013\n\nAs far as next steps after the expulsion of the diplomats go, the Czech government is expected to announce that Russian company Rosatom will no longer be involved in expanding the country\u2019s Dukovany nuclear power plant. Security expert Janda thinks the country will now take a more \u201cconfrontational stance regarding act of Russian aggression.\u201d\n\nAnd political scientist Pehe is certain that both the government and ordinary Czechs will now expect the EU to speak with a united voice and condemn Russia over the bombings \u2014 just as it spoke out after the Skripal poisoning in March 2018."},

As part of the relocation process, Tripura has identified 15 locations for Bru resettlement and completed Aadhar enrollment of the Brus.\n\nEarlier, a group of local ethnic organisations protested against the resettlement plan and resorted to several agitations, including a few violent protests, in which two persons were killed and 20 others injured in North Tripura last year.\n\nThe displaced Bru came from Mamit, Kolasib and Lunglei districts of neighbouring Mizoram, fleeing ethnic clashes in 1997.

When you wear your mask, you\u2019re protecting not only yourself from the disease, but your loved ones too!\n\nThis is the message that Croma intended to spread through \u2018The Times Power of Print\u2019 (POP) campaign. The concept of POP is to embolden creative minds as well as students; to devise impactful campaigns that are inspiring and engaging, leaving behind a thought-provoking missive.\n\nThe 4th edition of Power of Print (POP) saw Croma, partner with The Times Group for the second time, seeking ingenious ideas to uphold the tenor of this year\u2019s brief \u2013 \u2018wear a mask not to protect yourself, but to protect the world from you\u2019.\n\nRitesh Ghosal, CMO, Infiniti Retail Ltd. (Croma) said, \u201cTo move beyond the pandemic, we need to step out in the world and resume our productive lives and the mask is an essential safe-guard against a resurgence of infections. Till date, India as a society has achieved limited success in persuading people to wear masks in public. A false sense of invincibility combined with the mistaken belief that the mask is intended to protect the wearer from the world has led to compliance only by some people and some of the time. Croma which started serving customers in its physical stores since early June has witnessed this reluctance to comply among customers first hand. I believe the answer lies in educating the individual \u2013 creating awareness that the mask actually helps protect his loved ones from him rather than him from the rest of the world\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s winning entry \u2018Spot the Serial Killer\u2019 conceptualised by WYP Brand Solutions endorsed the use of wearing masks to reduce the chances of contracting the virus. The winning team has won not only the Power of Print trophy, but also an opportunity to see their campaign released in the pages of the Times of India Group publications.\n\nThe POP campaign works as an extension to Croma\u2019s approach towards providing a safe and an ambient shopping environment for all. Right from ensuring that all safety protocols are followed at the stores \u2013 like donning a mask, sanitization stations, social distancing, to introducing other convenient shopping channels. Croma has introduced several features that allow the customers to shop from the comfort of their very homes. 1) the \u2018Shop with Video\u2019 feature allows shoppers to connect with the store staff via a live video call and close the purchase without having to visit the store 2) the \u2018connect to store\u2019 feature, that allows a customer to simply book a slot or speak to the store manager before he/ she visits the store. These features are sure to change the way the world shops for electronics.\n\nWith this powerful print campaign, Croma also launches its summer campaign \u2018Cool Life\u2019, that provides cooling solutions for every cooling need. Shoppers can choose from over 250 ACs, 300 Refrigerators, 100+ Fans & Coolers and avail of No Cost EMI options, Cashbacks and much more.\n\nVisit your nearest Croma store or http://www.croma.com today for more."},

A batting collapse, dropped catches, injuries and poor use of the decision referral system to review umpiring calls have been costly.\n\n\u201cWe have spoken at length about taking that opportunity when it presents itself and applying pressure for long periods until the opposition inevitably breaks,\u201c Arthur said. \u201cIf you take the West Indies series, we were in positions where we could have dominated but they managed to wriggle out of the situations.\u201d\n\nSri Lanka has won 16 of its 20 cricket tests against Bangladesh and lost only once _ at Colombo in 2017 _ although three of the last eight matches have ended in a draw.\n\nThere is a nice grass cover on the pitch and, while most expect the curator to shave it off before the test starts Wednesday, Sri Lanka seem to have changed their strategies to bank on their fast bowlers more than an inexperienced spin department.\n\n\u201cWe will look to get pitches that do give our pacers some assistance for sure but I believe we have all bases covered and have the ability to have a balanced side with spin as well,\u201d Arthur said.\n\nFast bowler Lahiru Kumara and former captain Angelo Mathews are expected to return to the lineup after missing the West Indies series.\n\nBangladesh, meanwhile, has struggled in recent months. There was intense criticism following a home series loss to the West Indies and a tough tour of New Zealand, where Bangladesh lost all six white ball games.\n\nThe absence of top allrounder Shakib Al-Hasan and left-arm fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman _ both unavailable because of the Indian Premier League _ will also be a test of depth.\n\n\u201cSri Lanka are a great team at home,\u201d Bangladesh skipper Mominul Haque said. \u201cWe have to take up this challenge and get a good result.\n\n\u201cIt will be a competitive series.

Prague had then expelled two Russian diplomats, and Moscow did the same.\n\nWhy Prague expelled Russia\u2019s diplomats\n\nAccording to Czech intelligence, Russian operatives were involved in an October 2014 blast at an arms storage depot in a wooded part of the country near the border with Slovakia. Two people who worked there died, and their remains were found after more than a month. The incident was then labelled an accident.\n\nHowever, investigative work by Czech authorities led them to lay the blame on Russia, specifically Unit 29155 of its GRU intelligence agency, the BBC reported.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 JOIN NOW \ud83d\udce3: The Express Explained Telegram Channel\n\nReports in Czech media claimed that munitions at the depot were destined for Ukraine to fight Russia-backed forces, or to forces against the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, which Russia supports. The Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babis, said the attack had been aimed at a shipment to a Bulgarian arms trader, Reuters reported.\n\nLink to the Salisbury Poisonings\n\nTwo persons linked with the blasts have been identified by the Czech Republic, and stand accused in the attempted poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent who along with his daughter Yulia was administered a nerve agent in Salisbury in the UK in 2018.\n\nThe accused Alexander Mishkin, 41 (left), and Anatoly Chepigov, 43.

Both Skripal and his daughter survived, but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, was died three months later by the same Novichok nerve agent from a discarded perfume bottle.\n\nCzech authorities matched the images of the men accused of the blast with those of the duo the UK accused for the Salisbury incident.\n\nAs per the BBC report, Czech police were able to do this using the passport scans the two had submitted to the company that had been operating the arms depot. The company, Imex Group, had received an email supposedly from the National Guard of Tajikistan, which asked for permission for a site inspection by the two men, one of whom it said was a Tajik national and the other from Moldova.\n\nThe two had booked accommodation near the blast site from October 13 to 17, and the blast occurred on October 16. The same day of the explosion, the pair went to Austria and took a flight to Moscow.\n\nRussia has denied all accusations, calling them absurd.\n\nWhat could happen now\n\nThe diplomatic escalation between Prague and Moscow is believed to be the most serious since 1989, when the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe ended.\n\nIt also adds to the worsening of relations between the West and Russia, which are already being tested by Russia\u2019s military buildup on its western frontier as well as in Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter that the Czechs \u201chave exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations\u201d.\n\nThe US has also said that it stands with its NATO ally in its \u201cfirm response against Russia\u2019s subversive actions on Czech soil\u201d.

Thanks to his perfect grasp of the mannerisms and accent (Kaluuya is British and nailed the Chicago South Side accent), Kaluuya was a very convincing Fred Hampton\n\nKaluuya had had a dream run this awards season in this particular category. He clinched the Golden Globe, Critics\u2019 Choice, Bafta, Screen Actors Guild award for the role. We feel it is a no-brainer here. Barring a major upset, Kaluyaa is taking this.\n\nThe other nominees in the category are\u2026\n\nSacha Baron Cohen for The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nSacha Baron Cohen was brilliant in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s The Trial of the Chicago 7 as political and social activist Abbie Hoffman and deserves the nomination.

The results of their work were published in the journal Cell on April 15. While the results might imply progress for this particular field of research called \u201cchimera research\u201d, they have also ignited a debate about how ethical studies of this kind are.\n\nWhat have the researchers done?\n\nBy integrating human cells into the embryos of macaque monkeys, researchers have created what is called a chimeric tool. Chimeras are organisms that are made up of the cells of two distinct species, in this case humans and monkeys. For instance, if this hybrid embryo was placed in the womb of a monkey, it could possibly grow into a new kind of an animal (however this was not the aim of this study).\n\nIn this study, the monkey embryos containing human stem cells stayed alive and grew outside the body for a period of 19 days.\n\nPreviously, in a 2017 study researchers integrated human cells into pig tissues as they thought that pigs, whose organ size, physiology and anatomy are similar to that of humans, could help them in creating organs that could ultimately be transplanted to humans.\n\nBut this experiment failed and they believe it is because of the large evolutionary distance between pigs and humans (about 90 million years). Therefore, after this experiment, they decided to pick a species that was more closely related to humans, hence macaque monkeys were chosen.\n\nWhat\u2019s the purpose of chimeric research?\n\nResearchers believe that this ability to grow cells of two different species together offers scientists a powerful tool for research and medicine, advancing current understanding about early human development, disease onset and progression and ageing. Further, research of this kind could also help in drug evaluation and address the critical need for organ transplantation.\n\nResearchers note how chimeric tools provide a new platform to study how certain diseases arise. For instance, a particular gene that is associated with a certain type of cancer could be engineered in a human cell. Researchers could then study the course of disease progression using the engineered cells in a chimeric model, which may be able to tell them more about the disease than results obtained from an animal model.\n\nBut what are the ethical concerns about this?\n\nSome rare hybrid animals exist naturally and were probably the result of unintentional cross breeding between animals of different species. In 2014, a rare hybrid animal called \u201cGeep\u201d was born in an Irish farm. Geep was a hybrid between a goat and a sheep, a result of the two mating. However, the birth of this geep was not artificially induced and the cross-breeding is believed to have happened unintentionally. Generally, different species don\u2019t cross-breed and if they do, their offspring don\u2019t survive for long and are prone to infertility.\n\nMules are another example of a hybrid animal that are the result of mating between a female horse and a male donkey. As per the Mule Museum, these hybrid animals are the result of intentional breeding by humans, which they first undertook in the ancient times. While mules can live a long healthy life, they are infertile which means that they cannot have offspring of their own.\n\nNewsletter | Click to get the day\u2019s best explainers in your inbox\n\nEven so, research that concerns itself with gene editing or something like chimera research, which involves artificially integrating cells from two distinct species concerns some scientists on ethical grounds. The reason is that while further research into chimeras might lead to progress, which could mean that they could be used as a source of organs for humans, these chimeras would still be a mix of human and non-human cells, a thought that makes many uncomfortable.\n\nWriting in Pursuit, Professor Julian Savulescu and Dr Julian Koplin, of the University of Melbourne, note that chimeric research raises \u201cthe philosophical and ethical issue of moral status: how should we treat other life forms?\u201d. They argue that chimera research has the potential to worsen injustice against animals and also point out the fairness in using part-human animals to meet human needs.\n\nIn the case of the recent research at Salk, researchers have made it clear that the chimeras created with macaques will not be used for human organ transplants but that they \u201cnevertheless reveal invaluable information about how human cells develop and integrate, and how cells of different species communicate with one another.\u201d Some scientists, however, are still skeptical since they feel that one of the goals of chimera research is to create organs that can be transplanted to humans.\n\nIn 2018, Dr He Jiankui made headlines when he claimed to have produced genetically modified babies using the gene editing technique CRISPR. Jiankui claimed that he had altered the genes of a human embryo that eventually resulted in the birth of twin girls with specific desired attributes \u2014 supposedly the first instance of human offspring so produced \u2014 using newly-developed tools of gene \u201cediting\u201d. The genes of the twins were \u201cedited\u201d to ensure they do not get infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, according to the claims.\n\nIn December 2020 a court in China sentenced him to prison for three years, with a fine of 3 million yuan (approx. Rs 3 crore), for illegal medical practice.\n\nTherefore, genetic modification like chimera studies continues to be a subject of major debate. In developing countries like India, genetically modified crops are also a contentious topic. Tampering with the genetic code in human beings is more controversial, as any such change can be passed down to future generations."},

(file photo)\n\nIndia has told China that the significance of the consensus reached between their leaders to maintain peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) cannot be \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d and called for the complete disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh to rebuild bilateral ties strained by the \u201cserious incidents\u201d which has strongly impacted the public opinion.\n\nIn a candid address to the ICWA (Indian Council of World Affairs)-CPIFA (Chinese People\u2019s Institute of Foreign Affairs) virtual dialogue on April 15, Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri also questioned the Chinese officials ignoring the \u201csignificant consensus\u201d reached by the leaders of the two sides about the importance of maintaining peace along the LAC.\n\nIn his lengthy speech, Misri said no country can set the agenda for itself without agreements from other countries, in an apparent reference to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its flagship project the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor over which India has raised concerns as it is being laid through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\n\nThe BRI is a multi-billion-dollar initiative launched by President Xi Jinping when he came into power in 2013. It aims to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes.\n\nChina also claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.\n\n\u201cIn a multi-polar world, no country can set the agenda by itself without prior agreement and consultation, and then expect everyone else to come on board. No single country can expect a discussion to focus only on issues of its own interest while ignoring those raised or reflected by others,\u201d Misri said.\n\nAbout the consensus between the leaders of the two countries for good relations, he said, \u201cit has often been pointed out by friends in China that we should stick to the consensus between our leaders. I have absolutely no quarrel with that\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I agree wholeheartedly. At the same time, I should point out that equally significant consensus has been reached between our leaders in the past as well, for instance the consensus that I just referred to on the importance of maintaining peace and tranquility, and it is important to stick to that consensus as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen a tendency in some quarters to sweep this situation under the carpet and characterize it as just a minor issue and a matter of perspective. This too is inadvisable as it can only take us further away from a sustained solution to present difficulties and deeper into an unfulfilling stalemate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it would be tantamount to running away from the problem and in a direction opposite to that where the promise of our closer development partnership lies,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the leaders \u201crecognised the inevitable presence of competition in the relationship, they also simultaneously prioritised cooperation and shunned containment, because they believed that containment was neither feasible nor advisable in respect of either country\u201d, he said.\n\nThough the border mechanisms were tested on multiple occasions, they \u201chelped maintain the all-important peace and tranquility on the borders, thereby helping create the environment in which the India-China relationship grew spectacularly between 1988 and 2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we must acknowledge that these enabling structures and the fundamental premise of the closer developmental partnership have been placed under considerable strain by the serious incidents and the resultant violation of peace and tranquility at the LAC in Eastern Ladakh in April 2020 and thereafter. The impact on public opinion has been particularly strong,\u201d Misri said.\n\nIndian and Chinese troops are locked in a prolonged standoff in eastern Ladakh since May last year. Soldiers from both sides completed withdrawal of troops from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February. But the disengagement has not taken place yet from various other areas in eastern Ladakh.\n\nTop Commanders of the two militaries held the 11th round of talks on April 9 to disengage the troops from Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang areas in Eastern Ladakh.\n\nMisri said the \u201csustainable solution\u201d to the \u201cpresent difficulties\u201d in India-China relations is \u201cit must be one, as External Affairs Minister Dr. S Jaishankar has suggested, that is based on mutual sensitivity and respect and paves the way for maximizing our mutual interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe first is to note the importance of the two sides having maintained a sustained diplomatic and military dialogue in attempting to resolve issues. These discussions thus far have helped in achieving substantial disengagement of our forces,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe second is to point out that senior leaders on both sides have committed and agreed that we must achieve complete disengagement in all friction areas. That would be an important first step towards considering de-escalation; it would also help in restoring peace and tranquility and, together, these would provide conditions for gradual and step-by-step progress in the bilateral relationship,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is also what would begin to restore trust and confidence in the relationship and help us rebuild the foundation of the relationship that was damaged through last year\u2019s actions in Eastern Ladakh,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said it was also important to recognize that in a post-pandemic world of altered equations, multipolarity is probably more important than ever, both in the Indo-Pacific and beyond."},

Now, a company wants to spin this into something beneficial for the environment.\n\nPaper Seed Co, a social enterprise from the outskirts of Mangaluru in southern Karnataka, has come up with a face mask that will not only protect people from the virus, but when discarded, will bloom into a plant. The innovative eco-friendly idea has struck a chord with the public and has created a huge buzz online.\n\nFounder Nitin Vas said cotton masks are actually made from recycled rags. \u201cThe outer cover is made from cotton plup utilising various scrap materials collected from the garment industry, and the inner linings are made from soft cotton cloth. They are thick enough, and effective to prevent infection,\u201d he explained to indianexpress.com over telephone.\n\nThe company, which has been making various recycled and plant seed goods since 2017, started experimenting with masks when the pandemic hit. \u201cMasks are essential for humans but they are also creating problems for other species. We see them lying on the streets and ending up in landfills, but forget that it also ends up in rivers and oceans creating irreparable damage to the environment and aquatic life,\u201d the 36-year-old said, explaining the idea behind his project.\n\nEach of the masks is handmade and the outer layer is embedded with seeds of plants or vegetables.(Source: Paper Seed Co) Each of the masks is handmade and the outer layer is embedded with seeds of plants or vegetables.(Source: Paper Seed Co)\n\nAlthough made from cotton, his masks are single-use only. Once used, one simply needs to throw them in the soil, water it a little and in a few days, it will hopefully grow into a plant.\n\nALSO READ | Medical masks or fabric masks: WHO shares guidelines on who should wear what\n\nAs the company already had the knowledge of making paper embedded with plant seeds, they used it to take it a step forward and implement it in cotton materials. But there is a cost to being environmentally conscious. At Rs 25 per piece, these single-use masks are not cheap, but we have to consider that each of the masks is handmade under a \u201claborious process\u201d.\n\n\u201cA product is truly eco-friendly only when it doesn\u2019t involve bigger industrial setups. These are not machine-made and hence, we can\u2019t roll out hundreds of products as they do in factories,\u201d Vas explained. \u201cThe process to create pulp and make sheets itself takes up around eight hours after which it takes another 12 hours to dry. Then each mask is cut out by hand using stencils and stitched. So, I would say, it\u2019s fairly priced,\u201d he added.\n\nVolunteers from in and around Pakshikere hamlet of Dakshina Kannada district are behind the unique project. (Source: Nitin Vas) Volunteers from in and around Pakshikere hamlet of Dakshina Kannada district are behind the unique project. (Source: Nitin Vas)\n\nFor Vas, however, the product and the company are much bigger than just making eco-friendly goods as his project generates employment in and around Pakshikere hamlet of Dakshina Kannada district. \u201cI believe in Gandhian philosophy of Swadeshi movement, where the core principle is to come up with sustainable solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cOurs is not a business model to generate profit but to find an ecological solution for a better future, where we train our village folks and harness the power of talented youths.\u201d\n\nBefore the pandemic hit, the organisation had nearly 300 people working on different products. Now, the number is not even 10 per cent. \u201cBecause it has seeds, our product can\u2019t be stored for a very long time. When lockdown happened we had to discard huge batches of seed paper which we failed to deliver,\u201d Vas said.\n\nEver since the company was started in 2017, it has tried to generate employment for villagers mostly the women in the hamlet. (Source: Nitin Vas) Ever since the company was started in 2017, it has tried to generate employment for villagers mostly the women in the hamlet.

Now, even if I\u2019m getting orders to create one lakh masks, I can\u2019t make it. I have enough volunteers registered with the trust to make it but what if I employ them and by the time we finish making it, it can\u2019t be delivered to the party, it\u2019ll again all lead up being a waste, and I can\u2019t take that risk anymore and put the villagers\u2019 earnings at danger,\u201d he explained. He has been engaging only with local and regional clients and smaller orders up to 3,000 masks.\n\nHis dream is to build a Paper Seed village with a larger workshop. But it is far from easy. \u201cI have the land, we have also started building a few of the workshops, but more funds are needed to start a proper setup,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough we have got offers from businesses we don\u2019t want to enter the trap of getting into a profit-making business because then our core value will be compromised,\u201d he said adding that they are open to taking up financial opportunities if it aligns with their ideology keeping the villagers in the centre."},

It has been understood that the UK, as of now, has added India to the \u2018red list\u2019 for COVID-19 travel. What does it mean, and what should travellers know about moving between these two countries? We answer some of your FAQs here; read on.\n\nWhat is a \u2018red list\u2019?\n\nRed list is essentially a travel-ban list. It discourages travel to and from certain banned countries. According to gov.uk, besides India, there are 39 other countries on this list, including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Oman, the Philippines, Qatar, South Africa, the UAE and Zimbabwe, among others.\n\nIndia\u2019s addition\n\nIndia is the latest country to be added to the list. The mandate is that if you arrive in the UK from India before 4 am on April 23, you must self-isolate for 10 days in the place you\u2019re staying and take a COVID-19 test on days 2 and 8.\n\nAdditionally, the gov.uk website states that from 4 am on April 23, if you have been in India in the previous 10 days, you will only be allowed to enter the UK if you are a British, Irish or third-country national with residency rights. You will need to quarantine in a managed quarantine hotel.\n\nWhich flights are travelling to the UK as of now?\n\nA Mirror report states that UK flight tickets from India have rocketed from \u00a3400 for an economy seat to \u00a32,000, since families have started to rush, in order to avoid the travel ban.\n\nWhile at present, there are a few flights from India \u2014 from cities like Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Hyderabad \u2014 to the UK, every day, after India\u2019s India\u2019s addition to the \u2018red list\u2019, the number of direct flights may drop. Airlines operating flights are: British Airways, Vistara and Air India, news reports suggest.\n\nWhy did India make it to the red list?\n\nAccording to a BBC report, UK health secretary Matt Hancock stated that there had been \u201c103 UK cases of the India variant\u201d. He said the vast majority of the cases of the new variant \u2014 officially known as B.1.617 \u2014 had been linked to \u201cinternational travel\u201d, and added test samples had been \u201canalysed to see if the new variant had any concerning characteristics\u201d, such as greater transmissibility or resistance to treatments and vaccines.\n\n\u201cAfter studying the data, and on a precautionary basis, we\u2019ve made the difficult but vital decision to add India to the red list,\u201d he said.\n\nThe UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also tweeted the move was made to ensure the UK did not lose its \u201chard-won progress on the vaccine rollout\u201d.\n\nThe latest data shows we must add #India to the Government\u2019s Red List, ensuring we don\u2019t lose our hard-won progress on the vaccine rollout. \u2014 Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP (@grantshapps) April 19, 2021\n\nFor more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"},

And if you think it is sort of insensitive and irresponsible on the part of such celebrities, you are not alone. Even actor-singer Shruti Haasan feels the same.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Quint, Shruti suggested flashing one\u2019s privilege during such a distressing time is not responsible behaviour. \u201cGlad they had a great holiday, they deserved it. I did not personally feel it was a time to go maskless in a pool. It has been a tough time for everyone and for some people much more. I think gratitude and being thankful for privileges is what is most important to know versus throwing your privileges in people\u2019s faces,\u201d she said.\n\nShruti Haasan added that she never let her guard down even when the lockdown restrictions were relaxed after the first wave of COVID-19 subsided.\n\n\u201cI was really thankful to go back to work. There were some teams which were extremely responsible and careful. And then there was \u201cone\u201d basically that wasn\u2019t. And I never forgot that we are still in a pandemic. Now it is easy to say \u2018oh we\u2019re still in a pandemic\u2019. But, I knew this three months ago. People thought that I was crazy, a psycho aunty yelling all the time. I was always on the edge about it and I don\u2019t think many people appreciated it,\u201d the actor said.\n\nShruti Haasan was last seen in Pawan Kalyan\u2019s Vakeel Saab.

While the world is running after numbers and adding megapixels to the cameras, OnePlus is unsettling the world of mobile photography by adding features to its cameras, showing the world what professional-level photography on a smartphone looks like.\n\nWhile OnePlus has left no stone unturned to make the OnePlus 9 Pro a flagship in every sense of the word (processor, display, design, battery), what is truly remarkable about it is its camera set up that not beats other smartphones hands down, but also lets it replace your professional camera.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nThe OnePlus 9 Pro comes with a quad-camera setup on the back which is led by a 48MP main sensor. This main camera is a massive 1/1.43 inch custom-built IMX789 sensor co-engineered by Sony and comes with a 2\u00d72 on-chip lens (OLC). Having such a huge sensor onboard allows the camera to absorb more light, resulting in more detail and better quality images. This large sensor is paired with a number of pro-grade features. It also supports 12-bit RAW, dual native ISO and DOL_HDR that allows the lens to hold much more colour information when compared to other lenses. The OnePlus 9 Pro also brings one of the fastest focusing speeds that one can get on a smartphone camera. Just one quick tap and the phone will instantly shift focus.\n\nIt is not just about stills. The sensor brings the same level of photography expertise to the video front as well. It features 16x the pixel count of standard 1080p for greater detail and clarity. While most of the world is stuck on 4K, this sensor allows you to shoot 8K videos at 30fps. 4K video recording also gets a boost, allowing users to capture 4K videos at a stunning 120fps. And the lights will not affect it much.\n\nThanks to DOL-HDR, the phone will deliver clear footage and the subject will stand out clearly even in backlit conditions. Nightscape 2.0 takes low light photography to another level, delivering surprisingly clear and detailed low light videos. The presence of optical image stabilisation (OIS) eliminate the chances of ending up with a blurry shot because of shaky hands, making capturing a moving subject (think people, pets, anything that moves) more fun and stress-free. Got a pet? Your gallery will be full of beautiful images of them because the OnePlus 9 Pro also comes with Cat and Dog Face Focus mode.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nAccompanying the main sensor is a 50MP ultrawide sensor. A Sony IMX766 sensor, it is 3.2 times bigger than the one on the iPhone 12 Pro Max at 1/1.56 inches. What\u2019s more, it comes with a Freeform Lens which is specifically designed to minimise the distortions at the edges of photos. The feature will ensure that when you are taking a picture of a beautiful landscape, the edges of it come out almost totally straight, giving you those pro-camera vibes. That\u2019s not all. To call this lens versatile would be such an understatement. The ultrawide camera can also be used to take close up shots. So you can use the same sensor to take in a scenery and then switch to taking macro shots of subjects from as close as 4cm. So you get the bigger picture AND the smaller picture, using the same lens. How cool is that?\n\nIncidentally, the camera delivers a massive 12 megapixel close up shot unlike most other smartphones that come with low-resolution sensors (2MP or 5MP) for macro photography. The same extraordinary performance extends to video as well. The 50MP ultrawide sensor can capture time lapse video, portrait videos, and comes with focus tracking which ensures the focus gets locked on your subject, no matter where it goes, as long as it stays in the frame.\n\nTo add to the already powerful camera set up, OnePlus has also added an 8MP telephoto lens. This sensor offers 3.3x optical zoom, allowing you to zoom in without losing detail. If you want to dive deeper and move even closer, it also offers a 30x digital zoom. Unlike many telephoto lenses on smartphones, this one comes with OIS which means a little shake will not result in blurry pictures. Finally, OnePlus has also not ignored our love for classic black and white. The brand has added a dedicated monochrome sensor that pairs up with the main sensor to deliver stunningly detailed monochrome images.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nWe saved the best for last. All this comes with expertise from one of the biggest names in the camera business. OnePlus has partnered with Hasselblad, the brand behind the first camera to have ever been on the moon, and the partnership aims to deliver photographs with colours as close to what is seen by the human eye as possible. OnePlus has used Hasselblad\u2019s Natural Colour Calibration system which delivers images with extremely realistic colours in both stills and videos.\n\nThe 12-bit RAW format on the phone captures 64 times as much colour as compared to the 10-bit RAW format that is present on most smartphone cameras. The Hasselblad effect is there in the camera interface as well. OnePlus is known for its clean, clutter-free UI and the brand has taken this one step further by using an interface based on Hasselblad\u2019s image processing software called Hasselblad Pro Mode. it is incredibly easy to use for casual users and for those who want to push their photography boundaries, the interface offers professional-level controls like the ability to customise ISO, exposure time, white balance and much more.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nThe OnePlus 9 Pro might be phone but its sensors put it right into the camera category \u2013 you get 8k video, telephoto zoom, an ultra-wide sensor with no curving on the edges, a macro sensor, a main sensor capable of taking 12-bit RAW images, and all the controls you would expect in a professional camera. And much more. All with the assurance of Hasselblad. Other phone cameras should feel unsettled. The OnePlus 9 pro delivers the pro photography experience that we have been so far missing from our smartphones. And that makes it a pro in the truest sense."},

They failed to get past a low score against Mumbai Indians in their last match.\n\nSRH have been hit hard by the lack of depth in their playing XI and below-par Indian bench strength.\n\nIn these circumstances, the onus rests on Warner to do some magic and inspire his side to bounce back in the tournament.\n\nA big innings is due from the SRH captain as he has scored just 93 runs from the three matches he has played so far with the 54 against Royals Challengers Bangalore being the highest.\n\nHe also needs some serious introspection before deciding his playing XI on Wednesday.\n\nWarner and Rashid Khan are certainties in the foreign players\u2019 slots, but the absence of Kane Williamson has been badly felt as he can provide solidity to the middle-order, especially after they faltered in three consecutive chases.\n\nGoing by Wridhhiman Saha\u2019s poor form, Jonny Bairstow is the frontrunner for the wicket-keeper\u2019s position.\n\nBut what would be troubling Warner most is the lack of depth in the team\u2019s local batting resources.\n\nIt\u2019s high time the likes of Manish Pandey, Vijay Shankar, Abhishek Sharma and Abdul Samad pulled up their socks as the likes of seasoned Kedar Jadhav and Priyam Garg are waiting in the wings for their opportunities.\n\nSRH have also been hit hard by the poor show of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and T Natarajan.\n\nNatarajan was replaced by Khaleel Ahmed in their last match and the latter did a good job to restrict Mumbai. But Bhuvneshwar continues to be on the expensive side.\n\nRashid has been economical but didn\u2019t look menacing so far.\n\nPunjab too are on a losing streak after the win in their tournament opener over Rajasthan Royals. They lost to Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals.\n\nAfter a batting collapse against CSK, Punjab made a significant improvement and rode on skipper KL Rahul (61) and Mayank Agarwal (69) fifties to post a challenging 195 for four against DC.\n\nBut a below-par effort from their bowlers spoiled the hardwork of the openers.\n\nMohammed Shami has not been in his best form so far and leaked runs but what would be a concern for KL Rahul is the performance of Australian pace duo of Jhye Richardson and Riley Meredith.\n\nBoth Richardson and Meredith were expensive in all the matches they played without much success and it is time for Rahul to think of other alternatives like Chris Jordan.\n\nYoung Arshdeep Singh has been impressive for Punjab.\n\nThe Teams:\n\nSRH: David Warner (C), Kane Williamson, Virat Singh, Manish Pandey, Priyam Garg, Wriddhiman Saha, Jonny Bairstow, Jason Roy, Sreevats Goswami, Vijay Shankar, Mohammad Nabi, Kedar Jadhav, J Suchit, Jason Holder, Abhishek Sharma, Abdul Samad, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Rashid Khan, T Natarajan, Sandeep Sharma, Khaleel Ahmed, Siddharth Kaul, Basil Thampi, Shahbaz Nadeem and Mujeeb ur Rahman.\n\nPunjab Kings: KL Rahul (c & wk), Mayank Agarwal, Chris Gayle, Mandeep Singh, Prabsimran Singh, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Sarfaraz Khan, Deepak Hooda, Murugan Ashwin, Ravi Bishnoi, Harpreet Brar, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ishan Porel, Darshan Nalkande, Chris Jordan, Dawid Malan, Jhye Richardson, Shahrukh Khan, Riley Meredith, Moises Henriques, Jalaj Saxena, Utkarsh Singh, Fabian Allen, Saurabh Kumar.\n\nMatch starts at 3:30 PM."},

An online campaign, launched against the axing of the trees, has so far garnered 73,841 people signatures.\n\nMeanwhile, Pramoda Devi Wadiyar, a member of the erstwhile Mysore royal family, in a letter to the Conservator of Forest, Mysuru division, has sought to draw attention to the writ petition filed by her in the High Court of Karnataka as well as the court\u2019s verdict dated June 19, 2020, wherein, it was held that \u201cthe entire extent of Survey No 4 of Kurubarahalli in Mysuru is a private property and the land parcel in question is a part of that survey number\u201d.\n\n\u201cIn the light of the court\u2019s judgment, the proposed felling of trees is unauthorised and amounts to trespassing.

Company officials give a similar reason: Men, confronted with the sight of their faces repeatedly during online meetings, want to improve what they see.\n\n\u201cBefore, most of our customers were males in their teens and 20s, but thanks to remote work we now have more businessmen,\u201d said Tezuka.

Tezuka said that\u2019s because businessmen who work from home have more opportunities to see their faces during online meetings and have thus started to care more about their looks.\n\nThe men\u2019s beauty industry has been expanding in Japan. According to research company Fuji Keizai Group, the men\u2019s cosmetic market grew from about 600 billion yen ($5.5 billion) to an estimated 623 billion yen ($5.7 billion) from 2018 to 2019.\n\nTezuka said older businessmen tend to spend more money and visit more regularly than those in their 20s and 30s.\n\nOne customer, Yoshihiro Kamichi, 44, recently came to Tezuka\u2019s salon to buy makeup for the first time.\n\nKamichi chose makeup for his eyelids and had foundation applied to his face. A makeup artist carefully trimmed his eyebrows and contoured his nose and face with brown shadow power.\n\n\u201cWho is this person? I was surprised at how different I look,\u201d Kamichi said while looking at himself in the mirror.\n\nShiseido, one of the world\u2019s oldest cosmetics companies, released free online makeup filters last month that let male users look like they are wearing men\u2019s beauty products such as blemish balms and foundation.\n\nThe men\u2019s beauty industry has been expanding in Japan.

(Representative image, source: Getty)\n\nWritten by Amit Chhabra\n\nThe last 12 months have been a game-changer for the health insurance industry as awareness around health insurance increased by multiple folds. The year 2020 saw health insurance become the most valuable segment in terms of premiums collected and lives insured as over 300 million lives were insured under health insurance from April \u2013 September 2020.\n\nThe two key factors that have driven maximum Indians to sign up for health insurance policies are \u2013 high prospects of hospitalisation due to COVID-19 and excessive treatment cost in private hospitals. While there was a sudden drop in the number of COVID-19 positive cases from October 2020 \u2013 March 2021, the situation is worrisome again as India continues to report over 1.70 Lakh COVID-19 positive cases since the last one week.\n\nAmidst the apprehension and uncertainty concerning the present scenario, we must evaluate the risks if the worst happens. Evaluating the risk primarily involves creating an adequate financial blanket to pay off the hospital dues if you or your family members fall prey to the virus.\n\nFor people who bought health insurance during this time last year, it is very important for them to renew the policy before the expiry date and for those who have yet not purchased a health plan, they must not delay the decision any more. Akin to all other types of insurance policies, a health insurance policy also needs to be renewed annually to reap health insurance policy benefits without any hassle. You can easily renew your health insurance policy online within a few clicks from the insurer\u2019s website or any of the online insurance market places.\n\nIt is entirely your prerogative on how and from where you wish to get your health insurance policy renewed but make sure to renew the policy before it expires. Here are some of the prominent disadvantages of missing out on your health insurance renewal date.\n\nInterruption in coverage\n\nUntil your health insurance policy is active, the insurer will continue to provide you adequate coverage and will cover hospitalisation expenses for the treatment of any ailment. However, if you fail to renew your health insurance on the renewal date, the policy becomes inactive.\n\nUnder a health insurance plan, any claim filled while the policy is inactive will not be entertained by the insurer and will be straightway rejected. Though every insurer provides a grace period of 30-days to revive the expired insurance policy, you still cannot make any claim during the grace period or till the time your policy again becomes active.\n\nIf you are hospitalised while your policy is inactive, the insurer will not provide any coverage. And, if you fail to renew the policy even in the grace period, your policy will lapse and the only solution you will be left with is to buy a fresh health insurance cover.\n\nMoreover, given the significant rise in the number of COVID-19 positive cases each day, you must not take the risk of staying uncovered under a health insurance plan as you never know when you may need the coverage.\n\nWaiting period\n\nWhen you buy a new health insurance policy, it comes with a mandatory waiting period that you need to serve before making filing a claim. While there is no waiting period on hospitalisation due to an accident, there is a 15-days waiting period on hospitalisation due to COVID-19 and a 30-days waiting period for all other ailments. For pre-existing ailments and other common conditions like maternity cover, Knee Replacement Surgery, Cataract and many more, there is a waiting period ranging between 2 \u2013 4 years.\n\nNow, if you do not renew your policy on the renewal date or even during the grace period, your health cover will lapse and you will need to buy a fresh health insurance policy. Under a new health insurance policy, you will need to serve the waiting period for different conditions again and in case during that period if you get hospitalised for the treatment of that particular condition, your insurer will not pay for the hospitalisation expenses. You will lose all the benefits earned by serving the waiting period and will need to start the process again.\n\nNo-claim bonus\n\nYet another prominent advantage that you may lose if you fail to renew your health insurance cover with the time period is a no-claim bonus. It is not always important that if you have bought health insurance coverage, you will make a claim every year and for every no-claim or claim-free year, the insurer awards you with a no-claim bonus.\n\nThe bonus can be in the form of an enhanced sum insured of your existing health insurance policy or discount on health insurance premium at the time of renewal. You can only avail the benefits of the no-claim bonus at the time of renewal however if you fail to renew the policy within the given time period, you cannot take advantage of the NCB benefits.\n\nThe author is Head-Health & Travel Insurance at Policybazaar.com.

Its destructive potential should have raised immediate red flags and led to widespread gene surveillance to look for its prevalence and spread.\n\nInstead, the genome sequencing exercise, already running at a snail\u2019s pace, slowed down further between November and January due to lack of funds, absence of clear directives, and, possibly, also disinterest because of the steadily falling Covid curve.\n\nNow, a third mutation in the B.1.167 has been identified and experts are hoping that this time, given the alarm bells ringing all around, the pace of intervention and follow-up picks up.\n\nGenome sequencing, the study of genetic structures of an organism and the changes happening therein, produces a wealth of information that can throw light on the origins of the virus, the routes it has taken to reach a particular geography and the changes, or mutations, that are making the virus stronger or weaker.\n\nAlso Read | Vaccine makers had sought funding help, market access opens up revenue source\n\nLess number of people came for vaccination at a vaccination center during weekend curfew called by Delhi Government (Express photo/Praveen Khanna) Less number of people came for vaccination at a vaccination center during weekend curfew called by Delhi Government (Express photo/Praveen Khanna)\n\nSuch information is crucial not just in designing control measures, but also in the development of drugs and vaccines. In fact, the early availability of gene sequences from China, United States and some other countries is one key reason why a vaccine could be developed in such a record time.\n\nIn India, however, genome sequencing crawled \u2013 in the first six months, India had barely done a few hundred sequences, when countries like China, the UK and US, had done several thousand and submitted these in public global depositories for scientists across the world to study.\n\nIt was only in January this year that the government set up the Indian SARS-CoV2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) to expedite the gene sequencing effort from India through a network of 10 laboratories.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of gene sequencing is to remain ahead of the curve, anticipate what new variants of the virus are likely to emerge, how they are likely to behave, and what can be done to contain their spread in the population. More the sequences, greater is our information about them, and more effective our response can be. Unfortunately, India has been well behind the curve on this front. We have been reacting to the developments, instead of anticipating it,\u201d said a scientist associated with the sequencing effort.\n\nGene sequencing is time-consuming and costly. It can take three to five days to develop one sequence, once the virus sample has been extracted, cultured and sent to the laboratory. Only a few government laboratories have been doing this gene sequencing work, which involves a huge amount of computer processing time. Developing one sequence can cost between Rs 3-5000.\n\n\n\nThe INSACOG was initially allocated Rs 115 crore for a six-month period. The money was to come from the Central government. However, no additional allocation was made and the Department of Biotechnology was asked to find the money from its own resources. The first tranche of money could be released only on March 31, the last day of the financial year. The allocation itself has been reduced to about Rs 80 \u2013 crore because that\u2019s what the DBT could come up with.\n\nIn the meanwhile, laboratories like the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad, and the Institute of Genomics and Integrated Biology (IGIB) in Delhi, have been sequencing the genome using their limited funds.\n\n\u201cLabs have very limited resources. To find money to do something extra is a very difficult proposition. Most labs diverted money from other running projects to work on sequencing, in the hope that they would be compensated sometime later. But funds were just one problem. There has also been lack of clear directives and goals,\u201d said another scientist who is also working on sequencing the virus genome.\n\nThe case of the double mutant variant is a very good example of how policy stumbled. \u201cIt was detected way back. It was found again in November and December. By February, this variant is exploding, almost coinciding with the surge in Maharashtra. The discovery should have been acted upon immediately. But nothing happened. Now we are fire-fighting,\u201d said the scientist quoted earlier.\n\nThere has been some improvement. Since INSACOG began work in February, more than 13,000 sequences have been developed from across the country. This is still not adequate.\n\nThe stated objective of INSACOG is to facilitate genome sequencing of five per cent of all the emerging new cases. That is an ambitious goal, considering that over 2.5 lakh new cases are being detected every day.\n\nTo meet the 5%-goal, more than 12,500 samples would have to be sent for sequencing. In reality, less than 1 per cent samples are currently being sequenced.\n\nBut already some information is emerging that can be red-flagged.\n\nMultiple sources have told The Indian Express that the Health Ministry was last week briefed about the possibility of this double mutant variant developing another significant mutation, and becoming a \u201ctriple-mutant.\u201d And three different varieties have been detected.\n\nTwo of the triple-mutant varieties have the new mutation in the spike protein and have been found in samples collected from Maharashtra, Delhi, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh \u2013 all second surge states. A third version of the strain has the mutation outside the spike protein but is still considered significant and has been observed in 17 samples, again from Maharashtra, Delhi and West Bengal.\n\n\u201cAs you can notice, West Bengal seems to be becoming the hotspot for such mutations. The new triple mutant could make the virus even more capable of evading human immune response,\u201d said a source. \u201cWe need to do a lot more sequencing of a lot many samples.\u201d\n\nGiven India\u2019s Covid curve, its rapidly increasing numbers and these new strains, the world is watching. Reports by the US-based Andersen Lab at Scripps Research, San Diego, as of April 18, show that 298 out of the total 566 sequences in the B.1.617 lineage have been detected in India since this lineage was identified on October 5; followed by UK (133) and United States (52).\n\nData also shows that in West Bengal, the B.1.617 strain was found in 133 out of 1373 samples; it was followed by three other surge states Maharashtra (122/1931), Karnataka (20/539), and Gujarat (16/859).\n\nSaid Karthik Gangavarapu of Scripps Research and part of the 20-member team studying global genome data: \u201cIn India, one thing to keep in mind is that B.1.617, seems to be increasing in prevalence but when you actually look at the number sequenced per day, that number is quite low. For example, in the last 10 days we are seeing under 10 sequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is we don\u2019t know which variant is contributing how much to the second wave,\u201d said Gangavarapu. \u201cWe don\u2019t have evidence either way. It could be B.1.617 or the B.1.1.7 (UK variant) or both. That is why genomic surveillance is very important.\u201d\n\nThe South African and Brazilian strains have added another dimension to the challenge. On April 16, the Health Ministry said that of the 13,614 samples processed, 1,189 samples tested positive for variants of concern. These include 1109 samples with UK variants; 79 samples with South African variant and one sample with the Brazil variant.\n\nIt did not give any figures for the double-mutant saying it was found in several countries and \u201chigher transmissibility of this variant is not established as yet.\u201d\n\n(Tomorrow: Vaccine rollout: the booster dose that went missing)"},

And now users even have the option of external storage that is affordable and functional. Sandisk which has had its iXpand range of storage drives meant to be used for iOS devices, has just upgraded its Luxe range. After the Sandisk Ultra Dual Drive Luxe of last year, we now have the iXpand Flash Drive Luxe this year catering to those who want to take backups of their iOS files or just transfer them easily to Android or other devices.\n\nThe iXpand Flash Drive Luxe has a very sleek design. It has USB-C on one end and a lighting port on the other, protected by a plastic cap. The other end goes inside the swivel cover when not in use.\n\nThe iXpand Flash Drive Luxe comes in an all-metal chassis and features dual lightning.

On my MacBook, I could use the USB-C side as a regular drive and move files there with a simple drag and drop.\n\nOn the iPhone, as soon as I connected the device, the app organised the files for a few seconds and gave me a menu of view, copy, backup and restore as well as store. The view option lets you see the files shared in the drive. The copy option offers the ability to copy files from the iPhone to the Drive and the other way round. When I selected the first option, the app started backing up my 25000-odd photos to the drive, without any intervention from my side.\n\nA look at the options the Drive app gives you to back up or transfer or store data. (Image credit: Nandagopal Rajan/ Express Image) A look at the options the Drive app gives you to back up or transfer or store data. (Image credit: Nandagopal Rajan/ Express Image)\n\nAlso, since this was going to be a process that will take days maybe, I could stop the back up and pick up where I left off after a while too. Every time I plugged the drive back in, it went back to saving more files from the phone. I found the process a bit slow, maybe because I had most photos in the best possible resolution and thus in the heaviest size. So the best way to do this might be to leave it plugged overnight for the first time \u2014 it saved a couple of thousand files in an hour if you leave it alone, that\u2019s about 10GB of data.\n\nOne can use this iXpand Drive app to free up space on an iPhone or to back up photos, videos, documents, and contacts automatically.

I loved how the drive itself saves files into different folders based on the year they were created in.\n\nThis helped me plug the drive later into my MacBook and remove the photos and videos unnecessarily taking up space on the phone over the past few years.\n\nThere is also a \u2018Do more store\u2019 where you can buy apps to use your files better. Most of these are Pro apps that lets you consume the videos or music, but all of these were also quite expensive by Indian standards. The app has dashboards to easily show how much of the space you have used and when the last backup was on.\n\nThe iXpand Flash Drive Luxe has a very sleek design. (Image credit: Nandagopal Rajan/ Express Image) The iXpand Flash Drive Luxe has a very sleek design.

In fact, on Android phones you don\u2019t need a dedicated app and can use the native files folder to access these files.\n\nOn the flip side, the app does hang at times. I am not sure if this was because of the heavy workload my phone was offering, or a quick with the software. It was irritating nonetheless. So expect an update soon.\n\nThe SanDisk iXpand Flash Drive Luxe is available at Rs 4,449 for 64GB, Rs 5,919 for 128GB and Rs 8,999 for 256GB."},

While OTT is one solution, they are also working their hardest to bring films back in theatres once situation improves. Bollywood producer-distributor Anand Pandit accepts, \u201cIt\u2019s a very challenging time to release a movie in theatres, not only business wise, but also in terms of marketing.\u201d Pandit should know, his upcoming project Chehre got delayed a few days before release.\n\nChehre, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Emraan Hashmi, Annu Kapoor, Krystle D\u2019Souza, Dhritiman Chatterjee, Rhea Chakraborty and others, was set to release on April 9. But the makers announced its postponement on March 30.\n\nDuring an exclusive chat with indianexpress.com, Anand Pandit opened up about why Chehre needs to be seen on the big screen and Rhea Chakraborty being a part of its cast. He also got candid about his other recent outing, The Big Bull having a digital premiere, apart from the new business model post the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nExcerpts:\n\nWas postponing Chehre\u2019s release, a tough decision?\n\nChehre is a larger-than-life kind of a product, which we want to release in theatres. That\u2019s our 100 per cent endeavour. But on the other side, we know the situation is going from bad to worse. So, we are keeping a watch. It\u2019s a good film. As a producer, I\u2019m ready to take that risk (of waiting for its theatrical release).\n\nBut then, the team will now have to re-build the buzz around the movie as and when it releases.\n\nFortunately Chehre is in the genre of thriller and suspense which doesn\u2019t really get dated. We\u2019ll plan a new promotional campaign because we have the advantage of people knowing about it. They\u2019ve loved the trailer and the look of Emraan Hashmi and Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nRhea Chakraborty\u2019s name missing from Chehre\u2019s poster raised a lot of eyebrows. How do you see such stepping stones while designing a film\u2019s promotional strategy?\n\nI don\u2019t see any reason for not mentioning her name. She is among the eight artistes in the film. We signed her much earlier and she completed her part satisfactorily. So, we are looking at her as one of the actors who\u2019s done a good job. Also, I don\u2019t want to take undue advantage of her situation for the commercial benefit of my film. That\u2019s why we decided that for the second poster, we won\u2019t mention her name. She\u2019s gone through enough turmoil in her life, and we didn\u2019t want to add more ripples. We got her into the picture, only when she was comfortable.\n\nWould you agree that releasing a film has become a bigger challenge post 2020?\n\nDefinitely. In the last one year, the very strong emergence of OTT brought some solace. But honestly, nobody thought about this kind of arrangement. Decisions about which films going on which medium were being taken on a daily basis. There was no scope of planning.\n\nDoes that mean releasing The Big Bull digitally was also a difficult decision?\n\nYes, because we wanted to give people the experience of theatres. We make films for mainstream cinema. But there was no light at the end of the tunnel. Hence, we decided to experiment with an OTT release. Also this kind of film can be watched alone in your homes. Films like Radhe or Sooryavanshi, or even my own Total Dhamaal are preferably watched with friends and family. The Big Bull suited both theatre and web. Even though a theatrical release is always our first preference, but we were literally compelled by the situation.\n\nWould you agree that there\u2019s no say of the directors and actors in such decisions, but only producers\u2019?\n\nI\u2019m not a dictator. I like to take the opinion of all the stakeholders of my projects \u2013 crew members, actors, directors, departmental heads and others, on what should be done with a film. Then I take the final call. Everybody should be comfortable with the plan.\n\nHow did Abhishek Bachchan react when you told him The Big Bull will release on Disney Plus Hotstar?\n\nWhen we started the dialogue, he was hesitant about the OTT release as he thought situation will improve in a month or two, so we should wait. But when we saw no end to it, he agreed as our money was at stake. He was very cooperative. He\u2019s a producer\u2019s actor.\n\nHow prepared were you for comparisons of The Big Bull with Scam 1992?\n\nEven my previous film Bazaar (2018) had the same subject. But, since we didn\u2019t have many films on this plot then, nothing was said. Also, when we can have 20 films on the share market in Hollywood, why not in Bollywood? I would say Scam 1992 was like a trailer for my film. It informed people about everything that happened. The young generation did not know about this story, and that series prepared them to watch my film. So we got the advantage.\n\nAlso read | Best Hindi films of 2021 so far, and the worst\n\nThe beginning of 2021 brought in some respite with productions and releases getting back on track. But with the second wave of the coronavirus, it\u2019s the same scenario again. What\u2019s going to be the cost of curfew for the industry?\n\n(Earlier) We were in a rush of shooting and releasing. But now, we understand the value of business. We have to take care of the daily wage workers, sanitisation of our crew members. We learned a lot of things in this new phase. A little more expenditure or loss is part of the business. This one year of mandatory pause gave an insight about life.\n\nGoing forward, what\u2019s going to be the impact on the industry and what will change?\n\nAny business is a roller-coaster. For 2-3 months, it\u2019s a wait and watch situation. We aren\u2019t declaring or finalising anything, but in the next two months when we stabilise, we\u2019ll return with bigger projects. Though I don\u2019t think any major change will happen. The south film industry, for instance, has been running continuously. I\u2019m sure in 4-5 months, even Bollywood will bounce back.\n\nAnd how do you see this new dawn of digital medium? At least there\u2019s no race for box office numbers there.\n\nIt\u2019s a new business. More edgy stories are coming up, more not-so-popular people are getting work. Small films are getting a space there. So, I\u2019m very happy with the emergence of OTT. It\u2019s a win-win situation for the industry.\n\nAs a producer, will you now decide which project should go for a theatrical release and which one to the web? What\u2019s going to be the criteria?\n\nSince we are on the threshold, we\u2019ll have to do a pre-judgement of a project. That bifurcation will happen soon. Criteria will depend on budget, storytelling, directors, actors, acceptance of OTT players whether they want that kind of film or not. Just like earlier we decided whether it is for satellite viewing or theatre, single screen or a multiplex, socio-economic Class A or C, it\u2019ll be the same between theatres and OTT channels too."},

In fact, according to a recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology, the use of music during training can stimulate people to undertake different kinds of exercises. In fact, listening to high-tempo music is even better, as it can make working out less challenging and more enjoyable and impactful, the study says.\n\nGet a goodnight\u2019s sleep to ensure you are physically active.\n\nFor more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"},

This section calls for imprisonment of up to five years and steep penalties that may go up to Rs 75,000.\n\nThe department has also proposed amending the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act to hike the penalty for first-time offenders from the paltry \u201cminimum of Rs 10 to maximum of Rs 50\u201d to \u201cnot less than Rs 750 extended up to Rs 3,750 per animal\u201d.\n\nThe Union Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying set the ball rolling for the amendment of the legislation with Joint Commissioner (AH) Dr S K Dutta inviting suggestions from stakeholders at a webinar. The webinar, held Thursday, was attended by more than 350 people including political leaders, chief veterinary officers, animal welfare activists and rescue organisations.\n\nIn its presentation, the department said the new penalty for first-time offences had been calculated as per the inflation rate. There were mixed reactions to this, however, with some seeking a higher penalty between Rs 1,000 and Rs 5,000 as a deterrent.\n\nIts proposed new section, meanwhile, has the following provisions\u2014\n\n11 (A): Gruesome cruelty or life-threatening cruelty against animals, for which the penalty is Rs 50,000 per animal or the cost of the animal as determined by a jurisdictional veterinarian. This carries imprisonment of one year which may extend to three years or both.\n\n11 (B): Killing of an animal for which the penalty is Rs 75,000 per animal or three times the cost of the animal as determined by the jurisdictional veterinarian, whichever is more, with imprisonment of three years which may extend to five years or both.\n\n11 (C): Exceptions (exemption to section 11 (B) killing of an animal): i) accident ii) in defence of self or property (iii) by an act of god or war (iv) any other unforeseen circumstance outside the control of any person in general.\n\nMany stakeholders said proposed Section 11 (C) was ambiguous and could be used to create loopholes that an accused might slip through in a cruelty case.\n\nUnder Section 12\u2014which deals with the practice of doom dev (the process of blowing air into a cow\u2019s vagina to induce production of more milk) or the injection of any substance to improve lactation\u2014the draft proposes Rs 75,000 as the penalty with imprisonment of three years which may be extended to five. The current penalty is Rs 1,000, two years in prison or both.\n\nIt also seeks to increase the limitation of prosecution under the PCA Act from three months to two years, as well as a new chapter for the formation of state animal welfare boards.\n\nThe stakeholders have been asked to email their suggestions latest by April 25 to awd-section@dahd.nic.in.\n\nThose who attended the session included Chairman of Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations (FIAPO) Dr Chinny Krishna, MP from Kendrapara, Odisha, Anubhav Mohanty, MLA from Jayanagar, Bangalore, Sowmya Reddy, animal rights advocate Gauri Maulekhi, animal welfare advocate Alokparna Sengupta and many others.\n\n\u2018MAKE SECTIONS COGNIZABLE\u2019\n\nAmong the most common suggestions from the stakeholders was to make the sections for animal cruelty cognizable, as well as higher penalty and quantum of sentence. Some also demanded provisions to ensure police action according to law, stating that in many cases, police refuse to register FIRs. Many also brought up the issue of speciesism, stating that all animals must have the same rights, including cows and chickens. The need for a \u2018dog bite protocol\u2019 was also brought up, as well as protection for animal feeders. Some stakeholders also emphasised the importance of incorporating feedback from farmers, who use animals in traditional practices.\n\nDr Dutta said that the feedback received would be mulled over by the department, adding that this is not the final proposal, but one that will be passed on by the department to the government, and the final decision will be taken by Parliament."},

Letters will soon go out to the e-commerce players to be more vigilant on this issue and prevent any such sale from their platform,\u201d a senior official said.\n\nThe move comes after all the three major private telecom players \u2014 Reliance Jio, Vi and Bharti Airtel \u2014 had through the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) had once again written to the DoT Secretary Anshu Prakash, apprising him of the sale of these devices which cause spectrum interference, thereby hindering quality services of the telcos.\n\nIn its letter on April 16, the COAI had asked the DoT to intervene in the matter and ensure a complete ban \u201con sale of these illegal repeaters and boosters, offline or online thru e-commerce websites/platforms through an appropriate notification to sellers of illegal repeaters in the country\u201d.\n\nThe industry body had in its letter also suggested that the DoT take up the issue with the commerce ministry to ensure a ban on the import of such equipment and talk to the home ministry as well to take action against the sellers of illegal repeaters and network boosters in the country.\n\nBoosters or mobile signal repeaters are usually installed by telecom companies at certain low connectivity places only after thorough verification of the area\u2019s network status, and at places where it is not easy to install new mobile towers. Such boosters work by drawing in all the available mobile signals in the area with low connectivity. The signal is then redistributed in small and concentrated clusters such as buildings or a small group of buildings.\n\nWhen telecom service providers install such signal boosters or wireless signal repeaters, they ensure that it does not in any way impact the network strength and coverage for people where the signal strength is good. Telcos also ensure that these repeaters do not interfere with their own spectrum and airwaves.\n\nOn the other hand, illegal boosters and mobile signal repeaters, telcos say, deplete the network strength by drawing in more than necessary airwaves and then redistribute it in a haphazard manner.\n\n\u201cThe concern is that, such wide band devices draw in network signals to provide connectivity to a particular building or area in an unregulated manner, thereby depleting the network strength in other surrounding areas and results into call drops and depleted network quality,\u201d the COAI said in its letter to Prakash."},

(PTI Photo)\n\nA week-on-week analysis of the last one month shows the weekly growth rate in new Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra has slowed last week, a possible effect of partial lockdown across the state, though public health professionals said it was too early to see this as a lasting trend.\n\nIn Mumbai, the weekly growth rate of cases between April 11-18 stood at 11 per cent, a drop from 14.9 per cent between April 4-11.\n\nMaharashtra\u2019s growth rate dipped marginally\u2014 from 13.1 per cent between April 4-11 to 12.6 cent between April 11-18. On Monday, the state recorded 58,924 fresh cases, and 351 deaths due to Covid-19. Mumbai recorded 7,381 cases and 58 deaths.\n\nDr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC, said it is still early to predict a trend. \u201cWe need to wait till this weekend to see if new cases continue to drop this week,\u201d she said, adding that the weekend drop in testing also leads to fewer cases every Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe decline in Mumbai cases, even if slight, comes almost a fortnight after partial lockdown was introduced.\n\nOn April 4, the state government introduced a slew of restrictions including shutdown of malls, restaurants, theatres, night curfews, and allowed only construction work, public transport, take-aways from restaurants and deliveries. On April 13, more restrictions were imposed, including weekend lockdowns, closure of all non-essential shops, shutdown of private offices, and only home delivery from restaurants and hotels.\n\nDr Rahul Pandit, member of the state task force, said it takes 10 days for the lockdown impact to be seen on new cases. Mumbai recorded 53,957 cases between March 28 to April 4, which rose to 67,817 between April 4-11 and dipped to 58,988 between April 11-18.\n\nWhile Mumbai has shown a decline in weekly new cases, Maharashtra has shown a rise in absolute numbers although its growth rate has slowed. State recorded 2.96 lakh cases between March 28-April 4, which rose to 3.96 lakh between April 4 to April 11 and further rose to 4.32 lakh in April 11-18 week. Its growth rate in same period rose from 10.9 to 13.1 percent and dipped slightly to 12.6 percent last week.\n\n\u201cThere may be a slight decrease, but we need to wait until April 25 to see if there is a dip in the number of critical patients to see the lockdown\u2019s impact. Generally it takes a few days for symptoms to surface and 7-8 days before ICU is needed. If cases are reducing, the impact on ICU cases will be seen in the next few days,\u201d Pandit said.\n\nHe added that even if the city continues to see a dip, testing must not be reduced. \u201cIf overall cases go down, we should increase testing in areas where there are clusters of cases or more cases are found,\u201d he said."},

Besides, mouth and nose, it has been found that the coronavirus can spread through the eyes too. A study, published in the Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology, determined that conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis can also be a symptom of COVID-19 besides the usual symptoms including fever, dry cough, and tiredness, aches and pains, sore throat, headache and loss of taste or smell.\n\nAccording to Dr Maurya, as per available data, only three per cent of people with COVID-19 will get conjunctivitis. \u201cWhen the virus infects a tissue called the conjunctiva, which covers the white part of our eye, inside of our eyelids, that results in conjunctivitis. Some of the other related symptoms are: the eyes become swollen and itchy. One may even have excessive tearing or increased eye secretion,\u201d said Dr Maurya.\n\nAcademic studies at the outset of the pandemic also identified conjunctivitis as a secondary symptom in about 10 to 15 per cent of Covid-19 cases.\n\nIf possible, we have to protect our eyes with glasses, instead of contact lenses.

We must stay very careful regarding any kind of uneasiness in our eyes, he added.\n\nFew tips for keeping eyes safe during the pandemic\n\n*We must avoid gathering, wear a mask always whenever in public and maintain social distancing\n\n*We need to wash our hands and eyes frequently\n\n*We have to avoid rubbing our eyes or touching our face frequently\n\n*If possible, we have to protect our eyes with glasses instead of contact lenses.\n\n*\u201dAs it is a challenging time for all of us, it\u2019s best not to take any risk and contact the doctor as soon as we start observing any symptoms. Without consulting the doctor, we should not use any eye drops or medicine as sometimes wrong medication may affect us adversely,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"},
