A new video by Facebook shows off wristbands that use EMG (electromyography) to turn subtle neural signals into actions.\n\nThese include actions like typing, swiping, playing games or even an archery simulator. The wrist bands that control all of this, also feature haptic feedback, allowing users to \u2018feel\u2019 their actions, which are now more responsive than simple hand tracking. Check out the video below\n\nA detailed blog post by Facebook Reality Labs offered more information on the new wristbands. The bands can track basic \u2018clicks\u2019 which are essentially touching your thumb and index finger together. The wristband will track your nerve signals via your arms, instead of a visual sensor.\n\nWhile the initial tech was developed for all these years ago by CTRL-Labs, Facebook wants to take the possibilities of the EMG wristbands to the next level by integrating them with day-to-day computing.\n\nFacebook said in the post that it has been implementing various prototypes that provide various kinds of haptic feedback. One of these is the \u2018Bellowband\u2019, with eight pneumatic bellows around each wrist, which inflate/deflate to produce distinct sensations. The \u2018Tasbi\u2019 on the other hand, uses vibrating actuators and a squeezing mechanism to relay signals to you.\n\nNot reading your mind\n\nMark Zuckerberg recently criticised neural implants, suggesting that people shouldn\u2019t have to get their heads opened (to fit a neural transmitter) to use virtual or augmented reality. Hence, the Facebook tech will use devices like the EMG band to collect data from your arms in a much less-intrusive way, unlike Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink.\n\nHowever, the bands will still collect a lot of data. While Facebook does have a neuroethics program to examine the privacy, safety and security implications of such tech, people will still need to trust that a lot of data based on how their body moves is being collected."},

The film is about the time when a heated nuclear race kept the East and West on perpetual edge. One such chapter in those tense times was the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, and the story the film tells is a crucial footnote in it, made up of two heroes \u2014 and their loving, silent wives \u2014 whose own tales remain largely unknown.\n\nThe two are an ordinary British businessman/salesman, Wynne (Cumberbatch), and a decorated Soviet military officer, Penkovsky (Ninidze). Penkovsky reached out to the Americans, worried over Chairman Khrushchev\u2019s increasing eccentricity and itch for war. Wynne was hired by the Americans and MI6 to get around the KGB by meeting Penkovsky in the guise of trade.\n\nDirector Cooke eschews the dramatics of the two superpowers for the drama of these two small men. Cumberbatch, also one of the producers, and Ninidze are excellent as two operatives, and husbands and fathers, who strike up an unusual friendship in unusual circumstances \u2014 with as much said between them as left unsaid. Meeting mostly in Moscow where even the walls have ears, they talk in snatches about their children, their dreams, and of a life beyond all this. There is a moment at the Bolshoi, and dance and drinks at the West End. But, Penkovsky knowingly, and Wynne increasingly, realise the risk of letting their guard slip.\n\nIn keeping it so intimate, the film both wins and loses out. The sense of what is at stake is never immediate, even when Wynne\u2019s American handler Emily (Brosnahan) spells it out rather too dramatically in one scene. The Courier spends too little time on the mechanics of the spy ring, and the ingenuity and difficulties of how Penkovsky got things out to the West through Wynne, and even all that he shared (you have to wait for the end titles to be told he is considered among the West\u2019s most precious Soviet sources ever). Cooke seems uninterested in adding any complexity beyond the large shadow of the n-bomb.\n\nIf that makes the film almost indescribably flat, an inordinate time is later spent to spell out what it means to be lodged in a Soviet prison. Even as The Courier\u2019s empathetic approach towards its Russian counterparts is a welcome relief, this section almost cancels it out towards the end.\n\nHowever, if just for the story of Penkovsky and Wynne, and how the two almost went into history not knowing they had saved a disaster, if just for the acting of Ninidze and Cumberbatch (and Buckley as Wynne\u2019s wife), and if just for a few quiet evenings in the alleyways of Moscow where heroes shine without gunshots and car chases, The Courier is worth a watch."},

We went there and we had to figure out what has happened.\u201d\n\nTendulkar said the IPL has provided the players the opportunity to run shoulders with the top stars and compete against the best.\n\n\u201cWith the help of IPL, I mean, yesterday I was watching the game, and Surya was batting and (Jofra) Archer bowled to him and Ben Stokes and the commentator said that it is nothing new for Surya because he has already played against Rajasthan Royals,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBoth Archer and Stokes play for Rajasthan Royals, so it is nothing different and he (Surya) knows what they do and he has played against them already. So, it wasn\u2019t first time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only reason I am saying that both these guys are ready to play for India and that just shows the bench strength of our team, it is really strong. So that\u2019s the beauty of our cricket now, that there are a number of players, who are ready to go out.\u201d\n\nBack in the field for the Road Safety World Series, Tendulkar said, \u201cIt\u2019s a special feeling to be back (in) the dressing room.\n\n\u201cLike I said that sport unifies everyone, no matter which part of the country you come from, which caste, creed, nothing, your bank balance, sport doesn\u2019t recognise anything, it only recognises the way you play,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is a fair ground for everyone and we have always believed that when we are there in the dressing room, it is one team, we are together. We have always taken pride in representing the nation, it is a huge honour.\u201d\n\nThe Indian Legends have already made it to the summit clash, which will be played on Sunday and according to Tendulkar, all the players are playing for a specific cause.\n\n\u201cIt is fun to be out there in the middle for a cause, and I would like to applaud all six teams that includes India and I am taking India\u2019s name here also. All the players have come here for a cause and they want to go out and give their best and.\n\n\u201cPlayers are diving around and trying to stop the ball, trying to bowl fast. So, we are here for a cause and it is a message that we are trying to give to everyone, create that awareness on road safety, which is sometimes taken for granted.\u201d\n\nTendulkar stressed on wearing helmets while driving.\n\n\u201cThe message is that we lose almost 1.35 million people globally every year because of road accidents and out of which 1.5 lakh lives are lost in India because of road accidents. It could be because of not wearing a helmet.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about not wearing helmet, not just for the rider but also the pillion\u2026 The stats show that from the age of 18-35, that age group 50 per cent of the lives are lost because of not wearing helmets and not taking precautions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe message we are trying to give everyone is when you are riding a scooter/bike/two-wheeler wear a helmet, if there is a pillion travelling with you make sure that the passenger also wears a helmet.\n\n\u201cIf you are driving a car, wear a seat belt, don\u2019t jump signals, don\u2019t drive on the wrong side of the road.\u201d"},

A picture of the dictator\u2019s bloodied face went around the world.\n\nAlso Read | Explained: Untangling the conflict in Libya\n\nHopes for a new beginning\n\nFor many politicians in the West, his death represented an opportunity for a new beginning: \u201cWe hope that after decades of dictatorship the people of Libya can now begin a new, peaceful and democratic chapter for their country,\u201d said German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. \u201cWe stand by the new Libya on its path to a better, peaceful and democratic future.\u201d\n\nThis was not to be. The violence did not stop for long and a civil war raged on for years. In hindsight the NATO intervention was not a complete success, even if it did bring an immediate end to the human rights violations of the Gaddafi regime and saved lives in the short term by curtailing the conflict, Thomas Claes, project director for Libya at the Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Tunisia told DW.\n\n\u201cHowever, it did not succeed in bringing long-term stability and democracy to Libya,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cAt the same time, it must be said that the current destabilization can be traced back to the policies and crimes of the Gaddafi era, to a much larger extent than to the NATO intervention,\u201d he added.\n\nMassive impact on migration\n\nThe war also had a massive impact on the lives of the between 600,000 and 700,000 migrants and refugees, largely from Sub-Saharan Africa, in Libya. Many of them were hoping to stay there. Had there been peace, the country would have offered good employment opportunities thanks to its natural resources. The war forced many of them to attempt the dangerous journey to Europe. Many of those who failed to cross the Mediterranean were captured by the Libyan coastguard and put into camps.\n\n\u201cAccording to many reports, human rights violations are frequent there,\u201d said Claes. Camps run by militias are apparently even worse. \u201cIt is almost impossible for rights organizations to monitor what is happening there,\u201d he explains. He added, \u201cThe situation of the people interned there is particularly difficult. Furthermore, the situation of refugees has got worse because of the pandemic, rising prices and the closure of borders in Europe.\u201d\n\nFragile ceasefire\n\nIn recent months, under the auspices of the United Nations, it has been possible to persuade local actors to come to a ceasefire agreement, possibly also because it has been understood that Libya is the site of an international conflict between external powers such as Turkey and Russia. Without political agreement, Libya could collapse completely, much like Syria. There has also been more pressure from the Libyan population itself.\n\nAt the beginning of February, regional actors reached a breakthrough at a UN conference. Representing the Libyan population, the delegates elected an interim government of national unity whose most important task is to organize elections which have been set for December 2021, as well as to draft a new constitution and introduce new voting rights. The interim government is supposed to step down after the elections. Claes said that the roadmap was largely positive, but there was also a series of problems. Recently, a confidential UN report accused the new prime minister Abdelhamid Al-Dabaiba of corruption and of having bought the votes of certain delegates. If this turned out to be true it would certainly confirm the impression that he plans to stay in power beyond December, said Claes.\n\nHe explained that the prime minister had created a particularly large cabinet, with 30 ministers and secretaries of state, to pacify as many factions as possible. \u201cOf course, this all has to do with money. Each group gets a ministry in order to have access to state funds which they can then distribute to their own clientele. This development seems to be a realistic vision for the coming months if not years,\u201d he predicted.\n\nClaes also speculated that the lawmakers in office since 2014 might also exert pressure to ensure that they kept their mandates beyond December in order to ensure access to state funds. He said that there was a fine line between consensus and corruption: \u201cLibya could develop into a kind of kleptocracy, in which corruption is effectively part of the system.\u201d\n\nThis might be the price to pay for stability and peace. But the uprising against Gaddafi and the NATO intervention 10 years ago had more ambitious political goals."},

(File)\n\nOfficials of the National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (NABARD), while presenting the state focus paper for Gujarat on Thursday, expressed concern regarding the decreasing credit flow in the agriculture sector.\n\nIn the state focus paper unveiled by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, NABARD has projected a target of Rs 2.25 lakh crore for 2021-22 for financing by banks under agriculture, MSMEs and other priority sectors of the state which is 20.32 per cent higher than last year\u2019s Rs 1.87 lakh crore.\n\n\u201cWhatever potential we asses each year usually comes close to the actual credit flow in the state. Banks need to work more in the agricultural sector, because there is a gap between the potential we asses and the achievement,\u201d said DK Mishra, chief general manager of NABARD, while addressing a gathering.\n\nThe state focus paper for the year 2021-22 states that as on March 31, 2020, against a target of Rs 78,434 crore under total agriculture loan in Gujarat, the disbursement was Rs 69,325 crore, which was 88 per cent of the target. In comparison, disbursements to other priority areas like MSMEs and Housing saw achievements of 164 per cent and 121 per cent respectively.\n\n\u201cIf I talk of KCC (Kisan Credit Card) which is a tool for disbursements of crop loans, then Government of India is worried about Gujarat along with other states. Under PM-Kisan Yojana, Gujarat has about 57 lakh beneficiaries, there are only 26-27 lakh KCC holders,\u201d Mishra said adding that the gap can be reduced if state government steps in.\n\n\u201cWhen the distribution of land happens in the family, the ownership does. To get transferred. They become beneficiaries for PM Kisan, but do not become eligible for KCC as per the norms of the banks,\u201d he added.\n\nC Saraswathi, general manger of NABARD, spoke about the Ground level Credit (GLC) flow in priority sector for Gujarat and said, \u201cThere is a matter of concern. Despite the GLC of MSMEs increasing 47 per cent to 51 per cent (during 2018-19 and 2019-20), GLC for agriculture has been decreasing for the past 2-3 years. The share of GLC has declined from 42 per cent to 38 per cent. This can become a serious problem in the coming future. So, agricultural loans, especially term loans, have to be increased.\u201d\n\n\u201cGujarat is the country\u2019s fifth largest economy and contributes 8 per cent to the country\u2019s GDP,\u201d said the official of NABARD which is the apex bank for all matters related to agriculture and rural development and for credit disbursement.\n\nWith more than 68 per cent farmers in the small and marginal holding categories, NABARD intends to promote more FPOs or Farmers Producer Organisations.\n\nIncubation centre\n\nNABARD also announced setting up of the first incubation centre at Sardarkrushinagar Dantewada Agricultural University in Banaskantha. The project cost is about Rs 10.5 crore of which NABARD will provide grant assistance of Rs 7.81 crore. \u201cIn next five years, 145 startups will be incubated in the agriculture and rural sector,\u201d Mishra added.

If you don\u2019t want that to happen, you can\u2019t expand them,\u201d Maas said when he sat down with DW\u2019s Chief International Editor Richard Walker in Berlin.\n\nDW then asked the foreign minister what he thought of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement this Tuesday that his government would lift the cap on the number of Trident warheads in the United Kingdom\u2019s nuclear stockpiles for the first time in more than 30 years.\n\nMaas replied that the German government: \u201cis of the opinion that there are already too many nuclear warheads in the world, not too few. That is also why we don\u2019t want nuclear arsenals to grow.\u201d\n\nThe Social Democrat added: \u201cThe past has shown that if one side has more nuclear weapons, the other side will try to catch up. And that is the disastrous arms race we have been in for decades.\u201d\n\nThe UK deploys its Trident missiles in four submarines, one of which continuously cruises the seas in order to maintain the ability to counterstrike in the event of nuclear attack. The decision will increase the number of missiles in the UK\u2019s nuclear stockpile by more than 40% \u2014 from 180 to 260 warheads.\n\nMaas says binding international treaties are key\n\nWhen asked directly if he considered the UK\u2019s decision to be a mistake, Maas reiterated that Germany wants to see arsenals shrink, replying: \u201cIf that is what you want, then you can\u2019t expand them.\u201d\n\nMaas stressed the importance of international treaties in that regard, saying people must be able to count on them limiting arsenals and prohibiting their expansion.\n\nStill, he acknowledged that such a situation could only works if all sides followed the rules.\n\nWithout international rules, \u201cwe\u2019ll always see that individual countries feel as if they need to acquire new weapons systems to maintain deterrence. Unfortunately, that is the situation we currently find ourselves in,\u201d he said.\n\nUS using \u2018clear language\u2019 towards Russia\n\nMaas was also asked about US President Joe Biden\u2019s recent comments that appeared to imply Biden believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is \u201ca killer.\u201d\n\nHe refrained from addressing that specific comment but noted, \u201cthere is very clear language in the United States with regard to Russian activities, for example in Syria, but also when it comes to influencing elections in third countries.\u201d\n\nThe German diplomat stressed the pragmatism tied to that direct approach: \u201cI believe it\u2019s an important signal that American foreign policy is clear on the one hand when it comes to human rights and freedoms, but also that it wants to be in a position to keep the window for dialogue with Moscow open when it comes to major challenges such as disarmament and climate change,\u201d Maas said.\n\nCrimea annexation \u2018clear violation of international law\u2019\n\nSpeaking almost exactly seven years after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine, Maas said the act \u201cwas and is a clear violation of international law,\u201d saying that Germany and many allies\u2019 position remained that this should be undone. He said it was \u201cnot an issue that can be solved militarily, but we will continue to make this expectation clear to Russia.\u201d\n\nHe said that Russia itself might had an interest in normalizing ties with Europe once again, years after its exclusion from what now is once again the G7. An important step towards improving ties would be \u201cfinding a solution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he truly believed Crimea would ever become part of Ukraine again, Maas said: \u201cThat is our position. I am aware that it could prove an extraordinarily difficult path.\u201d\n\nLukashenko \u2018trampling on our democratic values\u2019\n\nMaas also discussed the EU sanctions against Belarus after last year\u2019s highly contested elections and the subsequent crackdown against opposition protests and politicians. Despite the EU struggling to react as swiftly as individual nations like the US when imposing sanctions, Maas defended acting on a European rather than a unilateral level.\n\n\u201cWe also have to make sure that sanctions affect the right people in cases like these and do not hit civil society as a whole,\u201d Maas said. \u201cSo we must keep the economic consequences of such steps in mind. And that\u2019s why in the case of Belarus we decided to target those responsible. Not just [President Alexander] Lukashenko, but his entire apparatus.\u201d\n\nAsked how he viewed the man often dubbed \u2018Europe\u2019s last dictator\u2019, Maas said: \u201cHe is clinging on to power by dictatorial means and is trampling our democratic values underfoot.\u201d"},

But if your stress goes on for a long period of time or if you are dealing with a major upheaval, then your ovulation might get thrown out of sequence. (Photo: Getty/Thinkstock)\n\nBy Dr Prakash Kini\n\nRicha, a 36-year-old successful IT professional, walked into my consultation room with problems of conceiving after five years of trying. A little probe into her lifestyle revealed her enormous work pressure with frequent late nights with early wakeup calls and a constant lack of sleep. With my over 42 years of experience, I always tell people \u201cYour body is smart, it knows that (periods of stress) aren\u2019t good times to have a baby\u201d. At the same time, stressed out women probably also often have less sex and are more likely to smoke or drink too much alcohol or caffeine, habits that can hardly improve their performances.\n\nFacts about sleep\n\nSleep defined as short, less than 6 hours and as long, more than 9 hours was associated with a \u201creduced probability\u201d of pregnancy. https://images.indianexpress.com/2020/08/1x1.png\n\nWomen reporting sleep problems \u2013 other than sleep apnea \u2013 were 3.7 times more likely to be at risk for infertility than women with normal sleep patterns.\n\nMen who slept too little or too long had a 42 per cent reduction in probability of conception in any given month, using 8 hours as a reference point.\n\nMen who self-reported trouble with sleep half the time also had the greatest problems getting their partner pregnant.\n\nALSO READ | What is varicocele and how can it affect male fertility?\n\nEveryone gets stressed out once in a while. So if you are hassled for a few weeks at work or anxious about a big move, it most likely won\u2019t hurt your baby-making abilities. Did you know there\u2019s a long list of \u201clifestyle\u201d factors that we know can affect the fertility of both women and men? From obesity to smoking to stress, you can now add problems with sleep to the list. Sleep disorders likely increase the risk of fertility related issues for both sexes. But if your stress goes on for a long period of time or if you are dealing with a major upheaval, then your ovulation might get thrown out of sequence. So as months go by without conception, stress kicks in and women struggling with infertility have the same level of anxiety, depression and sleeplessness as women diagnosed with other related issues. As a result, a vicious cycle begins.\n\nResearch has shown that people who get less than 5 hours of sleep are more likely to suffer from obesity which can further lead to problems with fertility. Disturbed sleep can lead to infertility in 30 percent of females and also causing decreased ovarian reserve in 30 percent. Also male infertility can upsurge with sleep and stress causing low and poor quality sperms. Some studies show that women working night shift around their ovulation phase have 15-20 percent increased chances of miscarriage. CDC says that 10 percent women of childbearing age have trouble conceiving or finishing their pregnancy. I have come across a lot of my patients who are angry at their bodies, so they stop taking care of it and I tell them to challenge their negative thoughts like \u201cI will never get pregnant\u201d or blaming themselves for their malady.\n\nALSO READ | Late night use of electronic media devices causes male infertility, claims study\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nExercise for the \u201cjust right\u201d amount. Physical activity both lowers stress and boosts fertility. Working out moderately raised the odds of conception, but women who worked out more vigorously were less likely to get pregnant. Endorphins and catecholamines surge post exercise & physical fitness regimes and these are proven stress busters. Watch your weight. Even being slightly overweight may affect fertility and it is not just women that need to watch the scale. Obesity can also negatively impact male fertility leading to lower sperm counts. Just as eating too much can cause fertility issues, weighing too little or extreme dieting can lead to anorexia and end your menstrual cycles. A balanced diet is a must. Enjoy your coffee, but within limits. Drinking 4 or more cups can reduce a couples fertility chances by 26 percent. You might want to limit alcohol. Who doesn\u2019t know someone who\u2019s answer to a stressful day is a drink? A study showed that drinking three or more alcoholic drinks a week, significantly lowers a woman\u2019s chances of pregnancy. When stress gets in the way of sex and fertility, you need to be proactive in finding time for sex. Some general advice, creating a bedtime routine and sticking to it, avoiding work or checking emails just before sleep, keeping your bedroom work and Wi-Fi free. Meditation, music, sport of one\u2019s choice can stir up your exuberance. An enjoyable couple activity can be rejuvenating to have a positive effect in conceiving.\n\nALSO READ | Is lack of sleep disrupting your fertility?\n\nThe pandemic indeed disrupted our lifestyles. But seeing the silver lining, many couples did conceive during this lockdown. Thanks to work from home, zero travelling, healthy eating at home, having hassle-free sex and avoiding junk food may have turned the tables! Finally, deciding to have a baby is one of the most exciting times of your life, but when yet another month passes without a positive result, the excitement inevitably starts to fade. It is difficult to stay calm and be in a positive headspace month after month. But reducing stress is important for all couples trying to fall pregnant, regardless of whether you have just started trying or dealing with long-standing infertility issues. Sleep, stress and infertility are interlinked. Break the chain and results will be evident.\n\n(The writer is Group Medical Director, Senior Obstetrician & Gynecologist, Cloudnine Group of Hospitals, Bengaluru, Jayanagar)"},

This is only the second time the JD(U) has given a key post to any leader from outside. Last time, it was poll strategist Prashant Kishore who was made the party\u2019s national vice-president.\n\nWith Kushwaha as an MLC, the JD(U) has now the option to make him a minister. The special treatment being given to Kushwaha is not without reason.\n\nNewsletter | Click to get the day\u2019s best explainers in your inbox\n\nBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has turned 70, has been carefully nurturing his successor between party\u2019s national president RCP Singh and Upendra Kushwaha. The Bihar CM will tread cautiously on balancing power between his two undeclared number two leaders.\n\nWhile former bureaucrat RCP Singh has been a trusted Nitish lieutenant for years now, Kushwaha brings in greater leadership value to the party as the most important Kushwaha leader of the state.\n\nAfter former Union minister Lalu Prasad and former Bihar deputy CM and sitting Rajya Sabha MP Sushil Kumar Modi, Kushwaha is the only leader to represent all Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, state Assembly and Council. With Kushwaha returning to the JD(U), the party has a national face other than Nitish Kumar.\n\nKushwaha\u2019s return means consolidation of Nitish Kumar\u2019s core constituency of OBCs Kurmi-Koeri, known as Luv-Kush in political lexicon. As the RLSP chief, Kushwaha may not have been able to win any seat in the last Assembly elections, but he did play a spoiler for the JD(U) by getting 5,000 to 39,000 votes in 30 seats. The JD(U) clearly suffered in at least a dozen seats in Magadh (Gaya, Aurangabad and Jehanabad) and Shahabad (Bhojpur, Buxar, Kaimur and Rohtas) and some North Bihar seats. As Nitish and Kushwaha share the same political constituency, Kushwaha taking away even a minuscule percentage of votes is damaging to the JD(U) in a tight battle.\n\nThe fact that JD(U) was relegated to 43 seats in 2020 polls from 71 seats in 2015 at the third slot behind RJD (75) and BJP (74), Nitish Kumar is forced to explore all options to strengthen his party. This is where Kushwaha\u2019s return can bring him greater electoral value. With the Luv-Kush combination constituting about 10 per cent of the state\u2019s population, Nitish looks to consolidate it and keep cultiving the EBC and scheduled caste constituency.\n\nNitish has been dropping clear hints of utilising Kushwaha for next year\u2019s UP polls. It is quite possible the JD(U) would contest in some seats in Uttar Pradesh with a sizeable Koeri-Kurmi population. Kushwaha\u2019s services would also be used to further expand JD(U) base within and outside Bihar.\n\nThough it is too early to predict if Kushwaha could be the JD(U) CM face for the 2025 Assembly polls, it would all depend on how he conducts himself and curbs his off-the-cuff remarks. He also needs to refrain from making controversial statements. Kushwaha very well knows that the return to JD(U) is his last political gambit. He understands Nitish needs him as much he needs Nitish. He also knows that it is always tough for Nitish to make a choice between him and RCP Singh when it comes to succession. Kushwaha clearly has an edge in terms of leadership quotient over RCP. But there would always be a thin line between the two number twos of Nitish.\n\nKushwaha, who had started his political career under former CM Karpoori Thakur, had become Nitish Kumar\u2019s blue-eyed boy when he was made leader of Opposition in Bihar Legislative Assembly in 2004 replacing BJP\u2019s Sushil Kumar Modi. Kushwaha had fallen out with Nitish in 2007 but had returned to the JD(U) in 2009 only to quit it in 2013. Kushwaha had floated RLSP in 2013 and contested and won all three seats as an NDA ally in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. In 2015 Assembly polls, RLSP won only two seats and somehow lost its political bargaining. He drew a blank in the 2019 Lok Sabha as a Grand Alliance constituent and exited it for 2020 polls. Again, he didn\u2019t win any seat."},

REUTERS/Issei Kato\n\nHiromi Kawamura, who oversees the relay at the Tokyo 2020 organisers, apologised for delays, but said they were juggling vast amounts of fast-changing information, a shifting pandemic situation and negotiations with national and local governments.\n\n\u201cWe had to make a comprehensive plan as the first wave, the second wave, the third wave came,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cThat took a lot of time, we can\u2019t deny it, and I do believe that it made people in the local areas concerned.\u201d\n\nThe relay will run for four months, taking the torch across all of Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures, including far-flung islands, and will involve about 10,000 runners.\n\nCOME WHAT MAY\n\nThe government pledged to carry out the Games come what may, but officials on the ground said there were lingering fears it could be cancelled anyway. The Games were postponed last year two days before the torch relay began.\n\n\u201cWe knew everything would depend on the infection risk, so cancellation again was a possibility,\u201d said Kosei Shoji, an official in Fukushima, where the relay begins.\n\nThe starting ceremony and the first section of the relay will not be open to fans. Elsewhere, spectators need to wear masks, socially distance, and the relay could be halted if the course area becomes too crowded.\n\nThe governor of the western prefecture of Shimane has threatened to cancel the relay altogether, saying he would decide only a month before the event arrives there on May 15.\n\n\u201cThe sense is it will probably be called off, but we\u2019re preparing,\u201d said a Shimane official, declining to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. \u201cIf it comes off, we\u2019ll only have a month to do it, so that probably means working through the night a lot of times. And we\u2019ll have to pull in people from other offices to help.\u201d\n\nTokyo 2020\u2019s Kawamura acknowledged that it was hard to balance the celebrations usually accompanying a torch relay with the tough circumstances of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI think there is a feeling about whether it\u2019s all right to be having fun, when there are people who are suffering,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, this isn\u2019t the kind of fun you have riding a rollercoaster. It\u2019s having people who have contributed to the local areas as torch runners,\u201d she added.\n\nKawamura pledged to \u201cdo it safely, and the fun will be appropriate to having it take place during the coronavirus.\u201d"},

The Public Interest Litigation also seeks framing of guidelines to protect the privacy and data of users being collected by various social media sites and messaging apps.\n\nThe impugned privacy policy violates the 2011 IT Rules, the government said in a written reply to the court. It added that the privacy policy fails to specify the types of sensitive data being collected, provide an option to review or amend information or to withdraw consent retrospectively and guarantee further non-disclosure by third parties.\n\nThe Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology, in its reply, also told the court that the Centre has introduced the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, in the Lok Sabha and upon its enactment, the law \u201cwill limit the ability of entities such as WhatsApp issuing privacy policies which do not align with appropriate standards of security and data protection\u201d.\n\n\u201cPending the passage of this Bill, the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Rules made thereunder forms the extant regime on data protection, any privacy policy issued by a body corporate such as Respondent No. 2 must comply with the requirements specified in the Act and the accompanying Rules,\u201d the Centre wrote.\n\nIn the petition filed by a Noida-resident Dr Seema Singh along with Delhi residents Meghan and Vikram Singh, it has been argued that the fissures in law with regard to the data are \u201cquite conspicuous\u201d and a framework to regulate the same is the need of the hour.\n\n\u201cSocial media in recent years has been used by billions of people around the world and millions of Indians today are dependent on WhatsApp. Therefore, information, which is generally personal, is shared at an enormous level.

Being a part of the larger neighbourhood of Baithakkhana makes it one of the oldest streets to have developed in the city of Calcutta, but its rapidly changing face makes it easy to overlook that. This approximately 950-meter road starts at the crossing of Calcutta University and the Medical College and Hospital, and runs all the way down to Jagat Talkies cinema hall, ending where the neighbourhood of Sealdah begins.\n\nIn his telling of the story of the origins of Baithakkhana, H.E.A Cotton, who documented the city of Calcutta and its history during the 19th century in his book \u2018Calcutta: Old and New\u2019, writes that sometime in 1690, when the British first occupied the village of Sutanuti, Job Charnock of the East India Company was so inspired by the environs, that he went on to make the area a permanent settlement for the Company. He refers to a well-known tale of how Charnock conceived the idea of \u201cCalcutta\u201d when the village was only partially occupied by foriegn merchants.\n\n\u201cHe was wont to sit and smoke a meditative hookah under the shade of a spreading peepul tree, which stood at the junction of what is now Bow Bazar Street and Lower Circular Road. The spot went by the name of Boytaconnah (boitak-khana) or resting place, and for years it continued to be a favourite rendezvous,\u201d writes Cotton. This tree finds mention in A.Upjohn\u2019s map of Calcutta in 1794, on grounds that are now part of the Sealdah Railway Station, just a short distance from modern-day Surya Sen Street.\n\nThis image is a part of the collection of James Baillie Fraser\u2019s \u2018Views of Calcutta and its Environs\u2019. Fraser (1783-1856) arrived in Calcutta in 1814 and in six years in the city, produced this collection of sketches of the city, later published as a collection of 24 plates. In this plate, the view of the neighbourhood of Lall Bazaar is visible along with the Portuguese Church. At the east end of Lall Bazaar was the Bow Bazaar, sometimes called Boytaconnah Street. The accompanying text to this plate reads: \u201cAt its eastern end, where it joined the Circular Road stood a Catholic Church with its northern facade on Bow Bazaar. The Circular Road runs across the picture, while the tracks sweeping round from the left are those of carts heading eastwards to the Salt Water Lake. This is the church of Our Lady of Doris, begun in June 1809 and consecrated a year later, built by the munificence of Mrs Gracia Elizabeth.\u201d (Photo credit: British Library) This image is a part of the collection of James Baillie Fraser\u2019s \u2018Views of Calcutta and its Environs\u2019.

Kolkata\u2019s \u2018boipara\u2019, the book market, for which the official address is College Street, can be seen tapering down this street like tertiary roots, with book sellers who may have missed out on leasing space in the prime stretch making do with the remnants available here, in the greater College Street area.\n\nJust as the book shops begin to dwindle in number down the length of Surya Sen Street, there is another institution of immense historical and cultural value, so nondescript that it is possible to miss it if one isn\u2019t paying attention. On the ground floor of a decrepit one-storey building is the 102-year-old Favourite Cabin, one of the last remaining cabin restaurants in Kolkata still in operation. Set up in 1918 as an eatery for tea and toast by two brothers, Nutan Chandra Barua and Gaur Chandra Barua, this establishment is still run by the founders\u2019 descendants with little having changed in the menu or the layout since it was first opened. Only the prices on the menu have changed, having only slightly increased.\n\nOn the ground floor of a decrepit one-storey building is the 102-year-old Favourite Cabin, one of the last remaining cabin restaurants in Kolkata still in operation.

(Photo- Neha Banka)\n\nA small wooden board painted red spells out the establishment\u2019s name in Bengali and English, its simplicity belying its contributions in India\u2019s freedom struggle and Calcutta\u2019s socio-cultural and culinary history. Like many other cafes and restaurants in the larger College Street area, Favourite Cabin was frequented by revolutionaries as well as literary icons who spearheaded the Kallol Movement of 1923-35, like Kazi Nazrul Islam, Bengali writer Premendra Mitra and author Shibram Chakraborty.\n\nToday, a framed photograph of Nazrul Islam hangs over what was once his regular table, along with a black-and-white image of Rabindranath Tagore. Just beyond the seating area is a mid-sized kitchen that has its own story. One section in the wall in this kitchen, now boarded, is from where the revolutionaries would escape to avoid arrest by British police officials, says owner Saikat Barua, 54.\n\nAlso read | Tipu Sultan Road \u2014 One of the many legacies of Mysore ruler in a city he never saw\n\nThe establishment was a frequent meeting place for revolutionaries, many of whom were students in the nearby colleges and universities, where they would gather to plot against the British government. The owners of the establishment would alert the revolutionaries if they spotted British police out on the hunt for them, and the group would disperse through the concealed exit in the kitchen, climbing over walls and the adjoining network of terraces.\n\nThe establishment was a frequent meeting place for revolutionaries, many of whom were students in the nearby colleges and universities, where they would gather to plot against the British government.

(Photo- Shashi Ghosh)\n\nBefore it came to be known by its present name, Surya Sen Street was called Mirzapore Street, writes historian P. Thankappan Nair in his book \u2018A History of Calcutta\u2019s Streets\u2019 (1987), but not much is known about the story behind its former name. In December 1955, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation brought forth the proposal to rename the street that was implemented during a meeting held the next year in July. An entry in the Calcutta Municipal Gazette of October 1956 mentions that the new name was sanctioned in September 1956.\n\nSurya Sen, a revolutionary from Bengal, affectionately known as \u2018Master da\u2019, did not have any particular connection with the street that was named after him, says Arup Ray, joint secretary of the Sahid Surya Sen Bhaban, a research center and museum in Kolkata, that has extensive records on the life and work of Master da. Perhaps it was the municipal corporations\u2019 attempts to acknowledge the many contributions of a fearless son of Bengal who is most well-known for heading the Chittagong armoury raid of 1930.\n\nSen was arrested in April 1933 and subjected to brutal torture by British police for his sustained work in the freedom movement. He was tried and later hanged in January 1934. The street named after him does not have any statues dedicated to Sen, but there are a few across Kolkata. One of the most prominent is the one outside the Calcutta High Court, with Sen\u2019s name etched in Bengali, below the towering statue.\n\nOne of the most prominent is the one outside the Calcutta High Court, with Sen\u2019s name etched in Bengali, below the towering statue.

(Photo- Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe less well-known institutions on Surya Sen Street include the 142-year-old City College School founded by the Sadharan Brahmo Samaj. The address for the original building of this institution could not be ascertained, but the building on Surya Sen Street appears to be the second address to where it was shifted sometime in 1897. Over the years, the institution developed other branches across north Calcutta and expanded its curriculum.\n\nBefore it came to be known by its present name, Surya Sen Street was called Mirzapore Street. (Photo- Neha Banka) Before it came to be known by its present name, Surya Sen Street was called Mirzapore Street. (Photo- Neha Banka)\n\nThe street also appears to have once been the place from where Sri Gouranga Press, one of the city\u2019s most prominent Bengali printing and publishing houses, operated from its office at 71/1 Mirzapur Street, when the street was still so named, in the 1920s. That business doesn\u2019t exist anymore and it is not clear when it shut down."},

The civic chief has directed that their list should be put up at prominent spots in zonal offices as well.\n\nThe PCMC action stems from the fact it is falling way short of the year\u2019s target of tax collection. So far, the tax department has collected Rs 495 crore in property tax. It is still falling short by Rs 375 crore of the annual target of Rs 870 crore.

Therefore, we are expecting to fullfill the target by March 31.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the PCMC has decided to give relief to property tax defaulters.

Fad sparks body-shaming concerns", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/fashion/women-posing-in-childrens-clothing-fad-sparks-body-shaming-concerns-7235450/", "content": "The trend has ignited heated a debate about whether it promotes body shaming, with experts raising concerns that it reinforces the country\u2019s unhealthy standards of beauty.(Representational Photo)\n\nWritten by Yan Zhuang\n\nThe children\u2019s clothing section at Uniqlo in China has gained an unexpected new clientele: adult women.\n\nIn the latest viral challenge to sweep Chinese social media, women pose for dressing-room selfies in children\u2019s T-shirts from the Japanese fashion giant. The trend has ignited heated a debate about whether it promotes body shaming, with experts raising concerns that it reinforces the country\u2019s unhealthy standards of beauty.\n\n\u201cThis is a dangerous trend, not just in terms of a drive for thinness and the pressure this puts on women and girls, but also in terms of the overt sexualization of women,\u201d said Tina Rochelle, an associate professor in social and behavioural sciences at the City University of Hong Kong who researches the influence of gender and culture on health. She said that the small clothes are likely to be tighter and more form-fitting on a woman\u2019s body.\n\nALSO READ | Sameera Reddy pens powerful note on loving oneself\n\nOn Weibo, a microblogging platform, where the hashtag \u201cAdult tries on Uniqlo children\u2019s clothing\u201d has been viewed 680 million times, criticism is split between those who object to the unrealistic beauty standards the challenge promotes and those who express the more practical concern that women are stretching out the clothes and rendering them unsaleable.\n\nOne user called it \u201canother way of showing off the \u2018white, young, thin\u2019 aesthetic,\u201d referring to a phrase commonly used to describe the country\u2019s dominant beauty standard. The person added: \u201cIt emphasizes unhealthy body shaming and should be firmly resisted.\u201d\n\nAnother commentator wrote: \u201cAlthough I am envious of those women\u2019s figures, they should buy the clothes after trying them! The clothes are all stretched out, how can children wear them!\u201d Uniqlo did not respond to emails Thursday seeking comment.\n\nThe challenge has been labeled the latest iteration of \u201cBM style,\u201d a type of fashion recently popularised by the cult Italian brand Brandy Melville, which is youthful, casual and, above all, thin (its stores carry only one size: extra small).\n\nSince the brand opened its first Chinese store in Shanghai in 2019, it has become an aspirational symbol for young women desperate to squeeze into its clothes. An unofficial sizing chart circulated on Weibo showed how much women at various heights would need to weigh to fit \u2014 a 5-foot-3 woman would need to weigh 95 pounds.\n\nALSO READ | Jonah Hill has a message on accepting and loving your body; read it here\n\nBrandy Melville did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Jia Tan, an assistant professor in cultural studies from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said that the apparel industry is a prominent driver of what is considered \u201cstandard\u201d sizing. The same sizes are usually smaller in Asia than they are in the West, she said, and \u201cstandard\u201d sizes exclude a significant part of the population.\n\n\u201cI think we need to first question the tremendous social pressure on women, and why the apparel industries can have so much power in standardising how we look, before we point our fingers on those adult women who show off in children\u2019s sizes,\u201d Tan said in an email.\n\nSimilar online challenges have gone viral on Chinese social media before. In 2016, women \u2014 and some men \u2014 posed with their waists behind a vertical sheet of A4 paper to show they were \u201cpaper thin.\u201d\n\nThat challenge was so popular that celebrities took part and Chinese state media covered it, prompting one feminist campaigner, Zheng Churan, to write in a riposte, \u201cI love my fat waist\u201d on a piece of paper held horizontally over her waist.\n\nIn 2015, for the \u201cbellybutton challenge,\u201d people reached one arm behind their back and around their waist to touch their bellybutton \u2014 ostensibly to brag about how thin they were.\n\nThere seems to be some growing awareness of body positivity in China. A few months ago, a store faced a backlash for labeling larger women\u2019s clothing sizes as \u201crotten,\u201d prompting it to apologize.\n\nBut Rochelle, the City University of Hong Kong professor, noted that while there was an increasing willingness among women to call out body shaming and share their experiences of it online, there were few indications that society at large was changing.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to have hit home over here that fat-shaming and publicly discussing a woman\u2019s weight can have a major impact on a person\u2019s well-being,\u201d she said.\n\nFor more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"},

(AP File)\n\nThe coughing among the western lowland gorillas at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in January was the first warning sign. Soon the fears were confirmed: A troop of gorillas became the first apes known to test positive for the coronavirus.\n\nAround the world, many scientists and veterinarians are now racing to protect animals from the coronavirus, often using the same playbook for minimizing disease spread among people: That includes social distancing, health checks and, for some zoo animals, a vaccine.\n\nKaren, a 28-year-old orangutan, became the first ape in the world to get a coronavirus vaccine on Jan. 26 at the San Diego Zoo.\n\nKaren has received two shots of a vaccine from Zoetis, a veterinary pharmaceutical company in New Jersey, and has shown no adverse reactions. Since then, nine other primates at the San Diego Zoo have been fully vaccinated: five bonobos and four orangutans. Four more animals, one bonobo and three gorillas, got their first shot this month and will get a second one in April.\n\n\u201cI was really convinced that we wanted to get that to protect our other great apes,\u201d said the zoo\u2019s wildlife health officer Nadine Lamberski, who explained she felt urgency to act after the eight gorillas fell sick.\n\nGorillas rest in their enclosure before the reopening of the San Diego Zoo. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) Gorillas rest in their enclosure before the reopening of the San Diego Zoo. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File)\n\nThat virus outbreak was linked to a zookeeper who was infected but had no symptoms. Seven gorillas recovered after a mild cases of sniffles, but one elderly silverback had pneumonia, likely caused by the virus, as well as heart disease. He was put on antibiotics and heart medication, and received an antibody treatment to block the virus from infecting cells.\n\nAbout three dozen zoos across the United States and abroad have put in orders for the Zoetis vaccine, which is formulated to elicit a strong immune response in particular animal species.\n\n\u201cWe will jump at the opportunity to get the Zoetis vaccine for our own great apes,\u201d said Oakland Zoo\u2019s veterinary director Alex Herman, who is ordering 100 doses.\n\nZoetis got a permit from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide the doses on an experimental basis to the San Diego Zoo. The company will need to apply for the same permission to provide vaccine to additional zoos.\n\nScientists believe the coronavirus likely originated in wild horseshoe bats, before jumping, perhaps through an intermediary species, to humans. Now many researchers worry that humans may unwittingly infect other susceptible species.\n\nRight now, humans are the main vectors of SARS-CoV-2, with consequences for many animal species,\" said Arinjay Banerjee, a disease researcher at McMaster University in Canada.\n\nGreat apes such as gorillas, which share 98% of their DNA with humans, are especially susceptible, as are felines. So far, confirmed coronavirus cases include gorillas, tigers and lions at zoos; domestic cats and dogs; farmed mink, and at least one wild mink in Utah.\n\nScientists have also experimentally shown that ferrets, racoon dogs and white-tailed deer are susceptible, although pigs and cattle are not.\n\nThis could be a conservation concern, especially if the virus began to spread in a wild species with extremely reduced populations, like the black-footed ferret,\" which is endangered, said Kate Langwig, an infectious disease ecologist at Virginia Tech.\n\nAnother worry is that virus spread among other species could produce new variants, complicating health authorities efforts to curb the pandemic.\n\nIn Denmark, workers at a mink farm accidentally infected the animals. As the coronavirus spread among the mink, it mutated, and human handlers contracted the new variant. In response, the government ordered millions of mink to be killed.\n\nMutations happen when there\u2019s a lot of disease transfer going on between animals,\" said Scott Weese, a veterinary microbiologist at the Ontario Veterinary College.\n\nWestern lowland gorillas feed on vegetables at the zoo in Prague, Czech Republic. Western lowland gorillas feed on vegetables at the zoo in Prague, Czech Republic.\n\nMany recommended steps to minimize disease spread to animals are familiar: wearing masks and sanitizing shared equipment, regular health checks, and maintaining physical distance.\n\nSince the outbreak, the San Diego Zoo and its safari park north of San Diego have installed more fans at its indoor primate areas to increase air circulation. The staff wears double masks and face shields and limits their time indoors with animals.\n\nScientists and conservationists who monitor wild primates have also adapted their daily routines.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 has been a wake-up call for the world about the fact that these viruses can go from wild animals to people, and from people to great apes,\u201d said Kirsten Gilardi, executive director of Gorilla Doctors, a conservation group that includes field veterinarians who treat wild gorillas in Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThere are only about 1,000 wild mountain gorillas, so the threat of coronavirus infection \u201chas changed the way we do our work,\u201d said Felix Ndagijimana, the Rwanda country director for Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, a conservation group.\n\nFor the past year, field trackers who check on gorillas daily in the rainforest first get a coronavirus test, then stay with other trackers in an encampment for work stints of several weeks. This is to ensure that they don\u2019t pick up the bug by returning to their villages at night.\n\n\u201cIt was really a big ask of our team, especially during the pandemic. People want to be close to their families, but also keep the gorillas safe,\u201d said Ndagijimana. To date, he said, there have been no coronavirus cases among wild gorillas."},

(REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/File Photo)\n\nThe country\u2019s largest lender State Bank of India has seen a perceptible increase in the number transactions happening at its multiple digital channels, with the percentage moving from 60 per cent in the pre-pandemic period to 67 per cent currently, Chairman Dinesh Khara said.\n\nThe rise in the number of digital transactions at the bank was largely driven by pick up in e-commerce during the pandemic-induced lockdown, which restricted movement, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen e-commerce picked up, it was actually the digital channels we are offering that got wider currency and acceptability. That is one of the reasons our digital transactions have gone as high as 67 per cent now.\n\n\u201cI think it is a phenomenal number, considering the fact that we are a bank which is serving all kinds of customers \u2013 digitally savvy and not digitally savvy,\u201d Khara told PTI in an interaction.\n\nHe said the ecosystem such as round the clock availability of Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS) and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT), which got created recently, also helped the bank in scaling up its digital transactions.\n\n\u201cI think part of it (higher digital transactions) is coming from the ecosystem and a part of it has come from the bank\u2019s own effort,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe lender\u2019s digital lending platform \u2013 Yono (You Only Need One App) \u2013 has achieved significant growth during the current financial year.\n\nAt present, there are 35 million registered users of Yono and the bank is opening over 35,000-40,000 savings accounts per day with the help of the mobile app, he said.\n\nDuring the current financial year, around Rs 16,000 crore worth of pre-approved personal loans (PAPL) have been disbursed to 12.82 lakh customers through Yono, Khara said.\n\nWhile 59,000 crore car loans aggregating to around Rs 4,000 crore were sanctioned, the bank could generate 15,000 home loan leads worth Rs 4,000 crore with the help of Yono, he added.\n\nThe platform also helps in distributing products of the bank\u2019s subsidiaries including SBI Life Insurance, SBI General Insurance and SBI Card and SBI Mutual Fund.\n\nSo far in this fiscal, close to 25 lakh personal accident policies and seven lakh life insurance policies have been issued using the Yono platform, Khara said.\n\n\u201cAs more and more users are coming and using it (Yono), we are only ensuring that it becomes all the more robust so that it is in a position to handle and generate more volumes and create value for the bank, while also improving the experience of our customers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe bank is constantly augmenting the infrastructure required to support an increasing number of transactions through all its digital channels, he said.\n\nKhara said the bank\u2019s topmost priority is to provide safety to customers using its digital channels and has significantly scaled up capabilities to deal with any kind of cyber frauds.\n\n\u201cWe have ensured that the firewalls are strong enough and there should be adequate protection both at the end point as well as the server level,\u201d he said adding that the bank continuously keeps reviewing protection levels to ensure that all channels and networks stay protected.\n\nAccording to Kiran Shetty, CEO and Regional Head, India and South Asia for SWIFT, who was also part of the interaction, while the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated digital transactions and payments, it also necessitated remote working conditions, resulting in banks and financial institutions further ramping up their security infrastructure as cyber threats continued to grow. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) is a network that enables financial institutions to send and receive information about financial transactions in a secure environment.\n\n\u201cAt SWIFT, we actively support the global financial community in the fight against cyber-attacks by fostering a more secure financial ecosystem,\u201d Shetty said.\n\nHe said SWIFT\u2019s solutions such as Payment Controls System allows banks to mitigate fraudulent attacks by monitoring transactions on a real-time basis and detecting these potentially high risk transactions, alerting the teams and combined with the ability to block payments and transactions, prevents cybercrimes.\n\nShetty said SWIFT also runs a customer security program which its members need to follow. There are 31 principles to protect the environment in which SWIFT infrastructure operates.\n\nKhara said products from SWIFT have added to the transparency for customers, both in terms of tracking the status of various payments and the transaction costs.\n\nHe said going forward, digitisation is more likely a default option as the bank serves a variety of customers in different geographies but physical branches will remain.\n\n\u201cIt is not an \u2018either-or\u2019 situation. Physical and digital will co-exist. Our strategy is going to be phygital,\u201d Khara concluded."},

(Alexi McCammond/Twitter)\n\n(Written by Katie Robertson)\n\nAlexi McCammond, who made her name as a politics reporter at the Washington news site Axios, had planned to start as the editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue next Wednesday. Now, after Teen Vogue staff members publicly condemned racist and homophobic tweets McCammond had posted a decade ago, she has resigned from the job.\n\nCond\u00e9 Nast, Teen Vogue\u2019s publisher, announced the abrupt turn on Thursday in an internal email that was sent amid pressure from the publication\u2019s staff, readers and at least two advertisers, just two weeks after the company had appointed her to the position.\n\n\u201cAfter speaking with Alexi this morning, we agreed that it was best to part ways, so as to not overshadow the important work happening at Teen Vogue,\u201d Stan Duncan, the chief people officer at Cond\u00e9 Nast, said in the email, which was obtained by The New York Times.\n\nIn a statement included in the email, McCammond said her \u201cpast tweets have overshadowed the work I\u2019ve done to highlight the people and issues that I care about.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI wish the talented team at Teen Vogue the absolute best moving forward,\u201d she said.\n\nMcCammond, 27, established herself as a prominent political reporter last year. She covered President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign for Axios and was a contributor to MSNBC and NBC. In 2019, she was named the emerging journalist of the year by the National Association of Black Journalists. She would have been the third Black woman to serve as Teen Vogue\u2019s top editor, after Lindsay Peoples Wagner and Elaine Welteroth.\n\nHer job status became shaky days after Cond\u00e9 Nast named her to the position, when the offensive tweets she had posted as a teenager in 2011 resurfaced. They included comments on the appearance of Asian features, derogatory stereotypes about Asians and slurs for gay people. McCammond had apologized for the tweets in 2019 and deleted them. Screenshots of the tweets were recirculated on social media after her hiring at Teen Vogue was announced on March 5.\n\nWithin days, more than 20 staff members at Teen Vogue posted a note on social media saying they had made a complaint to company leaders about the tweets, and McCammond apologized for them again both publicly and in meetings with Cond\u00e9 Nast staff. \u201cI\u2019ve apologized for my past racist and homophobic tweets and will reiterate that there\u2019s no excuse for perpetuating those awful stereotypes in any way,\u201d she wrote in a March 10 letter posted on her Twitter account. \u201cI am so sorry to have used such hurtful and inexcusable language.\u201d\n\nAs the criticism of her hiring mounted, Ulta Beauty and Burt\u2019s Bees, major advertisers with Teen Vogue, suspended their campaigns with the publication.\n\nThe scrutiny of her tweets has come at a time of heightened concern about violence and harassment directed against Asian Americans. On Wednesday, after eight people were killed in shootings in Atlanta, including six women of Asian descent, Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s chief executive, Roger Lynch, sent a memo to the company\u2019s staff that said 1 in 10 of its employees identified as Asian.\n\n\u201cOur teams, our families and our friends have all been affected by the rise in hate crimes toward Asian people and it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d Lynch wrote in the memo, which was reviewed by The Times.\n\nMcCammond had been vetted before Cond\u00e9 Nast hired her, and top executives including Lynch and Anna Wintour, the chief content officer and the global editorial director of Vogue, were aware of the decade-old racist tweets, Duncan said in his note on Thursday, and McCammond acknowledged them in interviews with the company.\n\nWintour discussed the tweets with leaders of color at Cond\u00e9 Nast before the job was offered, according to a company executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel issue. McCammond struck Cond\u00e9 Nast leaders as an impressive candidate, the executive said, and they felt her 2019 apology showed that she had learned from her mistakes.\n\nAlthough the company was aware of the racist tweets, it did not know about the homophobic tweets or a photo, also from 2011, that was recently published by a right-wing website showing her in Native American costume at a Halloween party, the executive said. The vetting process did not turn up the additional material because it had been deleted, the executive added.\n\nCond\u00e9 Nast has reckoned with complaints of racism in its workplace and content over the past year. In June, amid the Black Lives Matter protests, Wintour sent a note to the Vogue staff, writing that, under her leadership, the magazine had not given enough space to \u201cBlack editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators\u201d and acknowledging that it had published \u201cimages or stories that have been hurtful or intolerant.\u201d\n\nAdam Rapoport, the editor-in-chief of another Cond\u00e9 Nast publication, Bon App\u00e9tit, resigned in June after a photo of him resurfaced on social media, drawing condemnations from the staff for an offensive depiction of Puerto Ricans.\n\nIn the last two weeks, as complaints mounted, Wintour tried to build support for the would-be Teen Vogue editor. McCammond also participated in meetings with Cond\u00e9 Nast staff members and other groups to apologize further and listen to their concerns, including one-on-one talks with journalists at Teen Vogue, according to six people with knowledge of the meetings.\n\nCond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s human resources department also met with the Teen Vogue staff, three of the people said. The publication\u2019s employees were reminded of a company policy requiring them to check with the communications team before making public statements. The staff members were also told they should keep their criticisms \u201cin the family,\u201d and they were left feeling they had little guidance on how to interact with their readers, one of the people said. The Cond\u00e9 Nast executive who shared details of the process that went into McCammond\u2019s hiring disputed that characterization of the meeting.\n\nIt became clear that her job was in jeopardy on Monday, when Wintour abruptly canceled a meeting scheduled for Wednesday for top Cond\u00e9 Nast editors, McCammond and the new editor-in-chief of Vogue China, Margaret Zhang, according to two people with knowledge of the plan. The cancellation was accompanied by a note saying the meeting would not be rescheduled."},

One Black minister or political figure after another rose to offer praise for Cuomo, with the leader of the state\u2019s chapter of the NAACP, Hazel N Dukes, even referring to the governor as her son, insisting that \u201che ain\u2019t white.\u201d\n\nThen Charles B Rangel, the former longtime congressman and New York political icon, heralded the importance of due process, telling people to \u201cback off until you get some facts.\u201d\n\nWhen opposition starts \u201cpiling up,\u201d said Rangel, now 90, \u201cYou go to your family, you go to your friends because you know they will be with you.\u201d\n\nAs Cuomo navigates a deepening scandal over allegations of sexual harassment, he has leaned on his deep well of support in the Black community, which has reliably backed him and twice helped him win re-election. The governor and his associates have been working the phones, seeking the support of Black leaders and elected officials who could serve as a firewall against the barrage of calls for his resignation or impeachment.\n\nThe phone calls have been supplemented by the governor\u2019s recent visits to vaccination sites, often flanked by Black and Latino members of the clergy. The Rev. Al Cockfield, who joined Cuomo at the Javits Center in Manhattan for one of the events, said he attended to send a purposeful message: \u201cI\u2019m standing with the governor.\u201d\n\nOf course, some of the governor\u2019s most prominent critics have also been Black officials, such as Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the State Senate majority leader, who was one of the earliest leaders to call on Cuomo to resign.\n\nYet a number of other Black leaders have helped Cuomo, a Democrat, blunt some of the blowback, with many saying they support investigations into the harassment claims instead of the governor\u2019s immediate resignation.\n\nAlso Read | The imperious rise and accelerating fall of Andrew Cuomo\n\nRepresentatives Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks, two high-ranking Black Democrats from New York, are among the few members of the state\u2019s congressional delegation who have not called on Cuomo to immediately resign.

Other Black women, such as Assemblywomen Crystal D Peoples-Stokes and Inez E Dickens, as well as Laurie Cumbo, a Brooklyn councilwoman, have been among his most vocal defenders.\n\n\u201cIt strikes a nerve for African-Americans at a lot of levels,\u201d said Charlie King, a longtime ally of Cuomo who was his running mate during his failed bid for governor in 2002. \u201cI think for African-Americans, in general, we believe for a lot of reasons that this rush to judgment never works out well for people of color and we believe deeply in seeing how it plays out before you convict somebody.\u201d\n\nA number of women, including former and current aides, have accused Cuomo of inappropriate remarks and behavior, including unwanted touching and unwelcome sexual advances.\n\nCuomo has defiantly rejected calls for him to resign, while denying that he has touched anyone inappropriately and apologizing for comments he said may have been interpreted as unintentional flirtation.\n\nA poll by Siena College released this week suggested that the governor had some support: Fifty percent of voters believed he shouldn\u2019t step down, compared to 35 percent who said he should.\n\nAlso Read | Andrew Cuomo accuser speaks with investigators for 4 hours\n\nThe poll suggested that the governor\u2019s support was stronger among the Black electorate.

The governor\u2019s favorability rating was also higher among Black voters, 61 percent, than white voters, 37 percent.\n\nMany of Cuomo\u2019s achievements, like raising the minimum wage and passing paid family leave, for example, have made him popular among Black voters.\n\nThe governor\u2019s team is now eager to reach an agreement with the State Legislature to legalize recreational marijuana, a long-stalled initiative with strong appeal among Black and Latino communities that have suffered from the disparate enforcement of drug laws. A deal could be announced this week, far sooner than originally anticipated, according to lawmakers familiar with the matter.\n\nTo many, Cuomo\u2019s attempts to rally support among Black influencers was just the latest example of the Democratic Party\u2019s reliance on its Black base in moments of political peril.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton employed a similar strategy during his impeachment battle in the late 1990s to weather the allegations related to his conduct with an intern, Monica Lewinsky, in the Oval Office. Cuomo was Clinton\u2019s federal housing secretary at the time.\n\nCuomo may also be taking cues from Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia, a Democrat who survived widespread calls for his resignation over a racist photograph in his medical school yearbook. Although the politics in New York and Virginia are different, Northam retained the support of Black voters throughout the controversy, with polls showing most of them favored him remaining in office.\n\nRace has already been thrust into the debate over Cuomo\u2019s fate, with some of his defenders drawing on problematic comparisons between the allegations against the governor and the wrongful persecution of African-Americans.\n\nIn a Facebook post, George Latimer, the Westchester County executive, compared those calling on Cuomo to resign to the mob that lynched Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Black boy who was wrongfully accused of offending a white woman in Mississippi more than 60 years ago. (Latimer, who is white, has since edited the post, noting that the comparison was \u201coffensive to some.\u201d)\n\nSome lawmakers, such as Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte, a Democrat from Brooklyn, have invoked the Central Park Five \u2014 the group of Black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of assaulting a white female jogger in 1989 \u2014 in arguing for a thorough investigation into the claims against Cuomo.\n\nThe Rev. Al Sharpton, an influential Black power broker, said there are concerns among members of his National Action Network of setting a \u201cprecedent of calling for someone\u2019s resignation before the investigation was completed,\u201d because it could be used against Black officials in the future.\n\nSome Black supporters have forcefully defended Cuomo\u2019s right to due process, with many saying it is a reflection of deep-seated skepticism among members in their communities who have not received fair trials or have been wrongfully convicted on false charges.\n\nProgressive Democrats like Jumaane Williams, the New York City public advocate, have emphasized that they, too, support due process. They said, however, that the debate over the governor\u2019s fate now centered on a question of his political judgment, one that also involved his past transgressions.\n\n\u201cFor me this is the last straw in a long line of wrongdoings for which the governor shouldn\u2019t be governor,\u201d said Williams, citing Cuomo\u2019s attempt to hide the full extent of nursing home deaths during the pandemic and his abrupt disbandment of an anti-corruption panel known as the Moreland Commission.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo, presents Hazel Dukes, president of the New York State chapter of the NAACP, with a cake to celebrate her birthday in the Harlem section of New York City amid the COVID-19 pandemic, New York.

(Photo: Reuters)\n\nCuomo angered Black voters and stakeholders in 2002, when he ran a bruising campaign in a Democratic primary against Carl McCall, damaging McCall\u2019s bid to become the state\u2019s first African-American governor. But Cuomo has regained the support of many of them since then.\n\nWilliams has pushed for Cuomo to resign, but he acknowledged the governor\u2019s ties to Black voters.\n\n\u201cI think the Cuomo name has particular meaning in the Black community,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey\u2019re also sensitive of being accused of things and not being able to defend yourself.\u201d\n\nLike Williams, some of Cuomo\u2019s most prominent foils throughout this crisis have been Black elected officials.\n\nStewart-Cousins, a Democrat from Westchester County, was, at the time, the most powerful Democratic politician to call on Cuomo to step down earlier this month.\n\nCarl E Heastie, the Assembly speaker, directed the Assembly\u2019s judiciary committee to begin a broad investigation into Cuomo that could potentially lead to the state\u2019s first impeachment in more than a century.\n\nThe investigation, which could take months, gave Cuomo some breathing room, leading some critics to speculate it was actually a mechanism to delay impeachment. Even so, it could fuel Cuomo\u2019s eventual departure.\n\nAnd Akeem Browder, a criminal justice reform advocate, said that seeing Cuomo getting vaccinated Wednesday at a Black church in Harlem reminded him of why he began distancing himself from the governor three years ago \u2014 because he felt as if he were being used.\n\nBrowder, whose brother, Kalief Browder, killed himself in 2015 after facing abuse at Rikers Island during the three years he was held there for allegedly stealing a backpack, went from being a guest at the governor\u2019s State of the State address to endorsing Cuomo\u2019s primary challenger, Cynthia Nixon, in 2018.\n\nBrowder felt the governor was not pushing hard enough for bail reform while benefiting politically from his presence at events.\n\n\u201cI thought how indicative it was of how willing he is to use and leverage his position,\u201d Browder said of Cuomo\u2019s appearance at the Black church this week. \u201cHe was literally pandering to the Black community to get his name out from under fire.\u201d\n\nAnd then there is Letitia James, the state attorney general, who is overseeing a separate investigation into the sexual harassment claims.\n\nJames, the first woman and first Black woman to be elected to the position, presents a dual threat to Cuomo: She has been talked about as a potential candidate to challenge him next year.\n\n\u201cIt has been the Black community that has kept up the governor\u2019s numbers,\u201d said Williams, the public advocate. \u201cI think there will be erosion if the governor tried to run again and there was a credible person who ran against the governor.\u201d"},

Coming a few months after Hansal Mehta covered the same subject in his critically-acclaimed show, 1992 Scam The Harshad Mehta Story, the trailer drew immediate comparisons between the two.\n\nThe Big Bull trailer takes us on the same journey, inspired by the life of Harshad Mehta, starting from his humble beginnings, his designs on Dalal Street, his relentless hustle of which insider trading and outright corruption were an intrinsic part, his superstardom in a slowly liberalising India and his sad end. However, unlike Scam 1992, the film is \u2018inspired\u2019 by his life and hides reality behind a veneer of \u2018Bollywood creativity\u2019.\n\nThere are a few things that are new, cars racing down Mumbai\u2019s streets, men being made to take off their clothes to check who is \u2018the informant\u2019, songs and what feels like patently Hindi cinema dialogues.\n\nWith Abhishek as the \u2018Big Bull\u2019, Ileana D\u2019Cruz plays the journalist out to unmask Abhishek Bachchan\u2019s character and his behind-the-scenes shenanigans.

In an earlier teaser, the film\u2019s producer Ajay Devgn\u2019s voiceover could be heard as he speaks about people born in humble homes being taught to keep their dreams in check. \u201cBut one man decided to change the game and remake the world,\u201d he said about the protagonist.\n\nAmid comparisons, both director Hansal Mehta and Pratik Gandhi, who played the lead in the SonyLiv show, sent their best wishes to The Big Bull team. \u201cCongratulations @juniorbachchan and the whole team of #TheBigBull.

Aluminium-air batteries utilise oxygen in the air which reacts with an aluminium hydroxide solution to oxidise the aluminium and produce electricity. One of the key downsides of aluminium-air batteries is that they cannot be recharged like lithium-ion batteries. Therefore, large scale use of aluminium-air battery based vehicles would require the wide availability of battery swapping stations.\n\nAluminium-air battery-based electric vehicles are, however, expected to offer much greater range of 400 km or more per battery compared to lithium-ion batteries which currently offer a range of 150-200 kilometres per full charge.\n\nExperts have noted that the aluminium plate in an aluminium-air battery is converted into aluminium trihydroxide over time and that aluminium can be reclaimed from aluminium trihydroxide or even traded directly for industrial uses.\n\nWhy is this technology important for India\u2019s EV push?\n\nCurrently, India is largely dependent on imports of lithium-ion batteries from China for electric vehicles. While some Indian companies have started manufacturing lithium-ion batteries in the country, metal-air battery solutions including aluminium-air batteries could offer a viable alternative to lithium-ion batteries and boost the domestic manufacture of batteries to meet India\u2019s growing demand for energy storage.\n\nAluminium-air based batteries are also expected to be significantly cheaper than lithium-ion batteries, thereby reducing the cost of electric vehicle usage and boosting electric vehicle adoption in the country."},

Param Bir Singh was removed as Mumbai police commissioner and senior officer Hemant Nagrale was appointed in his place. These are not routine transfers,\u201d the Sena said in an editorial in party mouthpiece \u2018Saamana\u2019.\n\nThe explosives-laden SUV found near Ambani\u2019s house and the suspicious death of Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of the vehicle, are worrisome. The opposition BJP has raised some questions over it, but while the state Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) was probing the Hiran death case, the NIA took over the investigation (into the vehicle found near Ambani\u2019s house), it said.\n\nHope its motive is not to malign the state government, it added.\n\n\u201cThe NIA generally probes terrorism-related cases. But there is no terror angle involved in this case and still it stepped in. However, the outcome of the agency\u2019s probe into the terror attacks of Uri, Pathankot and Pulwama is still a mystery. The 20 gelatin sticks found in Mumbai appears to be a big challenge for the NIA,\u201d the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.\n\nIt said that Param Bir Singh had taken over as Mumbai police chief during the difficult time of coronavirus pandemic and boosted the morale of the police force.\n\n\u201cDuring his tenure, the television rating points (TRP) scam came to light. A particular lobby in Delhi was upset with him over that,\u201d it said.\n\nNow, Singh has been transferred, but it does not make him a criminal, the party added. It also accused the opposition of politicising the death of Hiran and lowering the morale of the state police.\n\n\u201cAt least considering the prevailing situation, no one should commit such a sin. If the opposition feels it can gain power through such means, it is wrong,\u201d the Sena said.\n\nThe opposition seeks to know the political bosses in the Hiran case, it said, adding that they should themselves find it out. \u201cThere are no political bosses in such cases. This is not the culture of Maharashtra,\u201d it said."},

The Beatles, the company\u2019s top act, were defunct. Hits were scarce among its remaining roster. That year, the company lost $8 million.\n\nIt needed a saviour, and it found one in Bhaskar Menon, an Indian-born, Oxford-educated executive at EMI, the British conglomerate that was Capitol\u2019s majority owner. He became the label\u2019s new chief in 1971 and quickly turned its finances around, driving a gargantuan hit in 1973 with Pink Floyd\u2019s album \u201cThe Dark Side of the Moon.\u201d He later ran EMI\u2019s vast worldwide music operations.\n\nMenon, who was also the first Asian man to run a major Western record label, died March 4 at his home in Beverly Hills, California. He was 86.\n\nRest in peace #bhaskarmenon and for your achievements in the music business. We have barely people we can count as Indians who went onto make such a mark. Hopefully you\u2019re story inspires more. \u2014 Bratman (@Bratistotle) March 17, 2021\n\nThe death was confirmed by his wife, Sumitra Menon.\n\n\u201cDetermined to achieve excellence, Bhaskar Menon built EMI into a music powerhouse and one of our most iconic global institutions,\u201d Lucian Grainge, the chief executive of Universal Music Group, which owns the Capitol label and EMI\u2019s recorded music business, said in a statement after Menon\u2019s death.\n\nVijaya Bhaskar Menon was born May 29, 1934, to a prominent family in Trivandrum, in south India (now Thiruvananthapuram). His father, K.R.K. Menon, was the finance secretary under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru; the first one-rupee notes issued after India\u2019s independence from Britain bore his signature. Menon\u2019s mother, Saraswathi, knew many of India\u2019s leading classical musicians personally.\n\nMenon studied at the Doon School and St. Stephen\u2019s College in India before earning a master\u2019s degree from Christ Church, Oxford. His tutor at Oxford recommended him to Joseph Lockwood, the chairman of EMI, and Menon began working there in 1956.\n\nRIP Bhaskar Menon the first Indian to head a global company (EMI in the 1970s), a legend in the music business and a very classy guy.\n\nHe was one of my heroes & in 1979 when he offered me a job in the music biz I very nearly took it.\n\nHe will be missed. pic.twitter.com/8XEUvCQuuW \u2014 vir sanghvi (@virsanghvi) March 6, 2021\n\nA proud British institution, EMI controlled a wide musical empire, with divisions throughout Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America. While there, Menon assisted the producer George Martin, who later became the Beatles\u2019 chief collaborator.\n\nIn 1957, Menon joined the Gramophone Co. of India, an EMI subsidiary; he became managing director in 1965 and chairman in 1969. Later in 1969, he was named managing director of EMI International.\n\nCapitol, the Los Angeles label that had been home to Nat King Cole, Frank Sinatra and Peggy Lee, was reeling from business missteps and declining sales, and EMI installed Menon as its president and chief executive. He slashed Capitol\u2019s artist roster, tightened budgets and pushed for more aggressive promotion of the label\u2019s artists.\n\nIn 1972, Menon learned that Capitol was at risk of losing the next album by Pink Floyd, which blamed the company for the poor sales of its previous albums in the United States. Menon flew to the South of France, where Pink Floyd was performing and, after an all-night negotiating session, they agreed on a deal. Menon commemorated the terms on a cocktail napkin and brought it back to Capitol\u2019s legal department in Los Angeles, said Rupert Perry, a longtime executive at EMI and Capitol.\n\n@StevieVanZandt Hey Stevie just rediscovered a photo of you and my dad Bhaskar Menon who passed on the 4th pic.twitter.com/xHhvkYjpN0 \u2014 Sal Meloni (@sidharthamenon) March 14, 2021\n\n\u201cThe Dark Side of the Moon,\u201d released by Capitol with a huge promotional campaign, was one of the biggest blockbusters in music history; it stayed on Billboard\u2019s album chart for 741 consecutive weeks and has sold more than 15 million copies in the United States alone.\n\nLed by Menon, Capitol continued to have success in the 1970s with Bob Seger, Helen Reddy, Steve Miller, Linda Ronstadt, Grand Funk Railroad and others.\n\nIn 1978, EMI put its music divisions under unified management as EMI Music Worldwide and named Menon chairman and chief executive. He remained in that position until retiring from the music industry in 1990. From 2005-16, he served on the board of directors of NDTV, a news television channel in India. In 2011, an ailing EMI was sold to Sony, which bought its music publishing business, and Universal Music.\n\nIn some ways, Menon was an outsider in the Southern California music scene.\n\nMOURNING: BHASKAR MENON, ICONIC INDIAN IN THE GLOBAL MUSIC INDUSTRY \u201cFrom producing almost 30% of the world\u2019s recorded music at his prime to close relationships with The Beatles and Freddie Mercury..\u201d Read @BhuvanLall\u2019s tribute to the friend we lost\u2026https://t.co/ZoRsaTH1jz \u2014 KABIR BEDI (@iKabirBedi) March 5, 2021\n\n\u201cI was a very unusual and unlikely sort of person to be sent here under those circumstances to take overall executive command of Capitol,\u201d Menon was quoted as saying in \u201cHistory of the Music Biz: The Mike Sigman Interviews,\u201d a 2016 collection published by the industry magazine Hits.\n\nMenon\u2019s wife recalled in a phone interview that when they married, in 1972, Menon told her, \u201cThere are only two Indians in LA: Ravi Shankar and me.\u201d She recounted stories of the two men \u2014 old friends from India \u2014 scouring the city\u2019s exclusive west side in vain for good Indian food.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Menon is survived by two sons, Siddhartha and Vishnu, and a sister, Vasantha Menon.\n\nAlthough Menon was primarily known as a manager of the business side of the labels he ran, he had the respect of many musicians.

From the Bell Bajao campaign, which encouraged people to intervene in cases of domestic violence by taking simple actions like ringing the bell to its most recent Ignore No More and Dakhal Do campaigns, bystander action has been at the centre of their work.\n\nBreakthrough realised that, for it to be able to achieve this goal, it is essential that they better understand the factors which motivate bystanders to intervene or prevents them from doing so, especially in the context of violence against women. The lack of existing literature on the issue, especially in the Indian context, further confirmed their rationale for undertaking the study.\n\nBreakthrough launched the Ignore No More campaign in partnership with Uber India in March 2020 and concluded it in March 2021 with a comprehensive study on Bystander Behaviour.\n\nWhat is bystander intervention?\n\nBystander intervention is a critical tool for preventing violence against women in public and private spaces. Bystander refers to individuals around a survivor when an act of violence against a woman is committed and has the potential or capability to act. Intervention represents any positive non-violent action (sans morally prescriptive codes) taken by a bystander to immediately stop an act of VAW.\n\nSpeaking up and its ramifications Speaking up and its ramifications\n\nWhy do people intervene?\n\nPeople who intervened provided a number of reasons for their actions:\n\nThe urge to do the \u2018right\u2019 thing attesting to the presence of a strong moral component in speaking up.\n\nSome of the participants who were victims of child sexual abuse and domestic violence referred to unresolved rage at their own helplessness at the time of the incidents and how this pent up anger was triggered whenever they encountered abuse or sexual violence either themselves or witnessed others going through it.\n\nSome (both male and female) also talked about their own journey towards better gender sensitisation. Often it took them years to recognise certain kinds of violence and how it was symptomatic of skewed gender dynamics and patriarchal power.\n\nSome attributed it to their association with gender rights organisations either as volunteers, full time employees or general exposure to such spaces and issues.\n\nOnil, a Mumbai-based participant and social worker spoke about how the processes towards setting up a sexual harassment cell in office and conversations with one of his female colleagues helped him first think about the notion of \u2018consent\u2019. This turned out to be instrumental as it propelled him to read extensively around the concept and how it was key to gender rights.\n\nHow have people intervened?\n\nFrom an \u2018active\u2019 bystander perspective, intervention strategies and methods were influenced by multiple factors such as gender, age, socio-economic standing, gender rights awareness etc. Participants who had experience of intervention shared interesting methods of helping survivors. Often, speaking up and reprimanding the perpetrator had a huge impact in terms of stopping the incident. Other immediate kinds of intervention included:\n\nSwapping seats with survivors/victims: The importance of quietly dealing with a situation of gender violence was important, particularly from the perspective of the survivor. Giving one\u2019s mobile number to connect later (particularly involving cases of intimate partner violence wherein the woman might need time to reflect on her next step) Taking the survivor for medical help. Physically escorting someone home when she is being harassed. Resorting to violence or employing patriarchal scripts like \u201cDon\u2019t you have a mother, sister at home?\u201d\n\nA few of the participants were also drawn to some other methods adopted as redressal mechanisms for the long haul. A long-term intervention strategy shared by 30-year-old teacher Shakeel in Delhi involved community mobilisation. On being told by his female students about their difficulty of getting to school owing to eve-teasing on the streets around the institution, he and some of his colleagues came together to patrol the streets around peak hours. They also roped in the help of the cops and ensured regular patrolling. He says that it helped the girls get to school with a feeling of security.\n\nThe role of bystander action in enabling a survivor to speak up\n\nSocial norms at play: Numerous participants who had experiences of intervention expressed their exasperation at the \u2018silence\u2019 of most victims of abuse and sexual violence. A few of the participants did acknowledge the critical role played by structural and social conditioning in influencing female behaviour and \u2018choices\u2019. Participants of the study pointed out how girls were taught from childhood to be submissive and not challenge their surroundings, at least not overtly. Yet it is important to unequivocally state here that though she is a product of larger processes she is not merely a hapless \u2018victim\u2019 but a complex being who negotiates these hurdles in multiple subtle and covert ways.\n\nIntersection of violence against women and violence against children: As stated above, some of the participants who were victims of child sexual abuse and domestic violence referred to unresolved rage at their own helplessness at the time of the incidents and how this rage got triggered and pushed them to intervene in cases of violence against women. However, some participants also expressed deep distress even now if and when they faced abusive situations. One of the participants, who is a survivor of child sexual abuse, painfully narrated how every time somebody tried to inappropriately touch her she \u2018froze\u2019 being unable to react in any manner.\n\nRespondents (female and others) were offered three possible reasons in the survey, Respondents (female and others) were offered three possible reasons in the survey,\n\nMale and female bystanders: Is there a difference in approach?\n\nThere is also an interesting difference in the way men and women responded and intervened. Most men spoken to talked about the perils of being a \u2018stranger\u2019 while intervening for women unknown to them. Other passive bystanders questioned, often aggressively, the intervening man\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to speak up for a girl who was clearly not related to him. Some men also discussed concerns over their safety as an important factor. This reality motivated some male bystanders to assume kinship or romantic relationships with the survivor to gain the \u2018credibility\u2019 to intervene.\n\nSome men also talked about the difficulty of dealing with survivors who weren\u2019t vocal about what was happening to them. A few highlighted how the situation turned messy when, despite their intervention, some women failed to acknowledge abuse had happened. A male bystander talked about how such an experience had prompted him to think of ways to quietly deal with a situation without bringing attention to a victim, hence the rationale for his strategy. This is in contrast with a similar scenario in which a female bystander intervened a lot more overtly. On witnessing a girl being harassed by her male co-passenger in a shared auto 22-year-old Aruna directly confronted the perpetrator.\n\nReasons for intervention Reasons for intervention\n\nIn terms of women themselves dealing with sexual violence in public transportation they talked about using everyday objects such as safety pins as armour. Women travellers also demonstrated camaraderie with other fellow female co-passengers by strategically and quietly asking victims to move forward or aside without bringing attention to them. Avoiding potentially dangerous or violent situations is a common survival strategy employed by women while travelling.\n\nA male bystander related how such an experience had prompted him to think of ways to quietly deal with a situation without bringing attention to a victim hence the rationale for his strategy. This is in contrast with a similar scenario in which a female bystander intervened a lot more overtly.\n\nReasons for intervention in public transport Reasons for intervention in public transport\n\nSurvey results:\n\n78.4% respondents who identified as female or other said that they have experienced violence in public spaces (does not include public transport).\n\n68.0% respondents who identified as female or other said that they have experienced violence while taking public transport.\n\n70.0% of respondents said that they would ideally like to help in scenarios of gender based violence by intervening/speaking out (individually or in a group).\n\nThose who intervened* and why? Those who didn\u2019t intervene and why? 54.6% of respondents said that they had intervened in an incident of violence against women in a public space.\n\n5.3% respondents observed the discomfort of the woman/girl facing violence.\n\n67.7% respondents said that their intervention resulted in the violence stopping. 45.4 % respondents said that they have not intervened in an incident of violence against women.\n\n38.5% respondents said that they did not intervene because they did not know what to do.\n\n31% of them said that they were worried about their own safety.\n\n11.5% of them feel that they would be dragged into police/legal matters.\n\nWhat can we do to promote bystander intervention?\n\nShift from the protection approach to investing in agency of women and girls. Government should launch initiatives to promote individual action and behaviour against violence against women. e.g. Farishte Dilli Ke scheme\n\nBuilding accessible reporting systems, wide dissemination of reporting information, ensuring safety of the survivor and the bystander and setting up reporting tools in the transports, or other public spots. This will enable a conducive environment for preventing violence in public spaces.\n\nGender Sensitisation for police personnel, citizen- police interfaces for better community action.\n\nGender sensitive curriculums at the school level education system. Introducing gender equal practices among parents.\n\nNeed to bring in systemic and policy level shifts for prevention of violence against women and girls.\n\nShift from the protection approach to investing in agency of women and girls. Government should launch initiatives to promote individual action and behavior against violence against women. e.g. Farishte Delhi ke\n\nThe study was conducted with support from Uber India and IKEA Foundation.\n\nRead the full report findings here: https://inbreakthrough.org/bystander-report/"},

(AP)\n\nSuryakumar Yadav from Chembur hit his first ball in international cricket for a six, a one-leg pull that was all grace and timing. With wickets falling at the other end, his bold and elegant half-century gave India\u2019s innings the required momentum. Then came Shreyas Iyer from Lower Parel, taking care of the middle and death overs. In a win-or-bust game, India\u2019s batting royalty, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, fell cheaply and the innings desperately needed some spice. The duo provided the Mumbai masala, as India clung onto the match by eight runs.\n\nAnother player who plays for Mumbai, Shardul Thakur, who is from Palghar, then dismissed Ben Stokes and Eoin Morgan, besides holding his nerves in a nervy last over. Stokes was turning the game around with the bat. But Thakur\u2019s off-cutter did the trick, as he mistimed the ball to long-off. Another cutter \u2013 slower deliveries worked well for the Indian pacers at the death \u2013 terminated Eoin Morgan. The game changed on its head. Jofra Archer\u2019s late freewheeling could only delay the inevitable.\n\nThere was adequate support from Hardik Pandya and Co, too. Pandya was thrifty, his four overs costing just 16 runs, besides two wickets. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was crafty while Rahul Chahar, in for Yuzvendra Chahal, braved the heavy dew and snared two wickets. Jonny Bairstow\u2019s scalp, after conceding a four and a six, spoke volumes for the leggie\u2019s inner steel.\n\nBut the night belonged to Yadav\u2014his 57 off 31 balls, before being out to a controversial decision, set up the match. Iyer made 37 off 18 deliveries. Together they took the hosts to 185/8, a par score on a benign surface. England were eventually done in by the scoreboard pressure, Jofra Archer\u2019s late blast notwithstanding.\n\nIntent from outset\n\nMuch to their captain\u2019s delight, India showed intent from the outset. A team that has Washington Sundar batting at No. 9, should throw caution to the wind for fun in this format. India usually prefer slow burn. On Thursday, however, Rohit started with a six off Adil Rashid. But a leg-cutter from Archer had him out caught and bowled. Then strode in Yadav for his moment of reckoning.\n\nCredit to the Chetan Sharma-led selection committee to finally consider the 30-year-old for international cricket. When the team was announced for the series against England, Yadav had shed a tear. He was Mumbai Indians\u2019 batting x-factor in the last year\u2019s IPL \u2013 480 runs at a strike-rate of 145. The previous year saw him score 424 runs at a strike-rate of 130-plus. The India call-up came a little late, but better late than never.\n\nArcher welcomed him with a short delivery. Yadav went deep into the crease and inside the line to hit it over fine leg for a six. Kapil Dev\u2019s \u2018Nataraja\u2019 pull was served in a millennial package and the great man would have enjoyed it if he were at the ground. This match was played on the same pitch that had hosted the T20I series opener, with a little less grass cover but with added firmness. England\u2019s pace duo, Archer and Mark Wood, had softened up India\u2019s batting with brute pace in the first match. They did it in the last game as well. Yadav stood tall to imperiously hit a 149kph delivery from Wood through covers for a four. That was some way to announce himself in international cricket.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav leaves after his dismissal during the fourth Twenty20 match between India and England (Source: PTI) Suryakumar Yadav leaves after his dismissal during the fourth Twenty20 match between India and England (Source: PTI)\n\nStrokes flew in a flurry from his bat. After taking a boundary off Chris Jordan, Yadav turned his attention to Rashid. A sweep for a four followed by an inside-out six over extra cover; the batsman, in fact, was dictating the leg-spinner. KL Rahul unnecessarily tried to force the pace when he had the chance to play himself in. Kohli was stumped off a perfect googly from Rashid and Yadav needed to embrace pragmatism for the next few overs, which he did.\n\nHis dismissal, though, had a touch of controversy. A top edge off Sam Curran went to Dawid Malan in the deep who took the catch diving forward. From certain angles, it felt like the ball had kissed the floor, but the soft signal from on-field umpire KN Ananthapadmanabhan was out, and without any conclusive evidence, TV umpire Virender Sharma could not overturn the decision.\n\nSpare a thought for Iyer, probably batting a little too deep at No. 6 despite being in excellent nick. The responsibility fell on him after Yadav left. Rishabh Pant, too, got out when he looked set for back-end fireworks. Iyer\u2019s blitz turned out to be the difference. His ability to pick the gaps was exceptional, while His inside-out six over deep cover off a Jordan delivery was gorgeous. Iyer\u2019s presence makes the Indian middle-order meaty while Yadav in this form would bolster the top order."},

The state government claims Rs 12,110 crore worth of loans have already been waived, with around 16 lakh farmers benefiting.\n\nG Ajithan, general secretary of the Tamil Nadu Banana Growers\u2019 Federation, who took a Rs 1 lakh loan, says, \u201cThere are many farmers who haven\u2019t been able to repay loans for months and the interest was mounting.

Along with Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman, Chasten Buttigieg is now part of a growing club of Washington newcomers married to people who have broken barriers surrounding gender, race and sexual orientation in politics.\n\nPete Buttigieg made history as the first openly gay Cabinet member confirmed by the Senate. His husband, Chasten Buttigieg, made the arrangements: He hunted for a home in Washington, organized the move and transported their dogs, Truman and Buddy, across the country in a rental car.\n\nAs Pete Buttigieg settled in as the secretary of transportation in the Biden administration, the other Buttigieg sourced items from Facebook Marketplace to furnish their one-bedroom Capitol Hill apartment. The accouterments included a lamp since the couple had been eating Chinese food on the floor in the dark. The lamp seller kept marveling over how \u201cnormal\u201d the newcomer seemed to be, which made Buttigieg wonder what, exactly, passed for normal in Washington.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m humbled that you think I\u2019m a normal dude,\u201d Buttigieg said, reflecting on the interaction in a recent interview. \u201cBut I\u2019m also scared that you think I might not be.\u201d\n\nThe word \u201cnormal\u201d is overused in the Biden era, most often to illustrate the relief many people feel to return to politics as usual after four incendiary years of President Donald Trump. But President Joe Biden\u2019s ascent also cleared the way for a new class of boundary-breaking politician, starting with Kamala Harris, the first female vice president. In turn, a new class of political spouse is challenging ideas of who should serve as a supporting actor.\n\nAlong with Doug Emhoff, the second gentleman, Chasten Buttigieg is now part of a growing club of Washington newcomers married to people who have broken barriers surrounding gender, race and sexual orientation in politics. Dan Mulhern, who is married to Jennifer Granholm, Biden\u2019s new secretary of energy and the first woman to be elected governor of Michigan, is another member.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really pretty simple,\u201d Mulhern said. \u201cMen are doing what women have always done, just as women are doing what men have always done.\u201d\n\nBoth Emhoff and Buttigieg, who became friends and traded supportive texts while their spouses campaigned for the presidency, have both begun the post-campaign process of defining themselves in Washington.\n\nButtigieg, 31, was a middle school teacher before he put his career aside to support his husband\u2019s presidential campaign, which began in earnest less than a year after the couple married in 2018. He said that he knew he was privileged to have time to think about what he would do next but that he felt the responsibility of being one-half of the highest-profile gay couple in U.S. government. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s necessarily available for me to just disappear,\u201d he said.\n\nFrom the rental car on down, little about Buttigieg\u2019s move to Washington has been typical. The coronavirus pandemic has paused the traditional welcome-to-Washington cocktail parties and the celebrity politicians\u2019 pilgrimages to Cafe Milano. Buttigieg said he had in any case avoided the flood of introduction emails in his inbox.\n\nAlthough the transportation secretary makes $221,400, according to government salary data released in January, the Buttigiegs\u2019 life as a Cabinet family contrasts with some of their most notable predecessors who lived in suites in the high-end Jefferson Hotel, like Robert Rubin, the Clinton-era Treasury secretary, or in multimillion-dollar homes in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, like several members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet and inner circle. Nor is Buttigieg familiar with Washington\u2019s customs and unspoken rules. It is unclear what kind of pointers and tips he will get from his direct predecessor in the transportation spouse department, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader and husband of Elaine Chao.\n\n\u201cIt feels like this is maybe a place where innocence goes to die,\u201d Buttigieg said of the parts of Washington he is now privy to.\n\nIn a much-photographed interaction, he recently got coffee with Emhoff to talk about finding new projects and adjusting to life in the capital, where the Buttigiegs moved from South Bend, Indiana.\n\n\u201cSometimes you just need to get out of the house,\u201d he said, \u201cand check in with somebody.\u201d\n\nSome days, while his husband is at work or fielding Zoom calls from the bedroom, Buttigieg, who is adapting his memoir, \u201cI Have Something to Tell You,\u201d for younger readers, takes the dogs out. Buddy and Truman have expansive social media profiles, and Buttigieg is often mistaken as the dog walker by fans.\n\n(\u201c\u2018What\u2019s it like to walk Pete\u2019s dogs?\u2019\u201d he said he is asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a living,\u201d is his response.)\n\nBalancing his life as a political spouse with his own identity has been trickier than he had imagined.\n\n\u201cPete is getting up in the morning, going to work and doing the thing that makes him really happy,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThat thing for me was getting up and going to school every day. Now I have to figure out if that is something I can return to.\u201d\n\nHe could learn from several of the women in his orbit. Jill Biden, the first lady, is the first person in her role to work full time, as an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College.\n\nConnie Schultz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer who is married to Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said she still fielded questions about whether she would continue to work. One of her husband\u2019s Senate colleagues, whom she refused to name, told her that her job was \u201ccute.\u201d\n\nSchultz is sensitive to the idea that people believe a political wife should be the one solely responsible for showing the public that her husband has a family-focused side and notices that, in Emhoff\u2019s case, \u201cnobody\u2019s accusing him of trying to humanize his wife,\u201d the vice president.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having these conversations now because men are becoming recognized in their spouse role,\u201d Schultz added. \u201cWhich is also frustrating when you\u2019re a woman and have been doing this for quite some time.\u201d\n\nIn November, Emhoff was praised for leaving his law firm, where he had been a corporate lawyer, to support Harris\u2019 transition to the vice presidency. There was little coverage when he took a job on the faculty of Georgetown Law one month later.\n\nAs part of his official duties, Emhoff has posed for selfies against murals of his wife and handed out cookies with her at a Washington veterans hospital. This week, he traveled with her to Las Vegas and Denver to help sell the particulars of a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. At public appearances, he often looks like he is just about the only person having any fun in Washington.\n\nKelly Dittmar, a political science professor at Rutgers University who has written about gender representation in politics, praised Emhoff and Buttigieg for speaking openly about their roles supporting a partner in power.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve both been really willing to talk about it in ways that help us progress forward and push us to think differently,\u201d Dittmar said.\n\nButtigieg said he kept that in mind when he had interactions that felt foreign to him. While he figures out what is next, he is trying to treat each conversation as a call \u201cto remember that you\u2019re here for a certain reason,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are accustomed to politics looking a different way, and you\u2019re here to make sure that, you know, it can look a different way.\u201d"},

However, in both cases of beneficiaries testing positive after dose 2, the window period of 14 days, which is required after dose 2, for antibodies to develop, wasn\u2019t completed yet.\n\nDr Rajesh Bhaskar, nodal officer, Covid-19, Punjab, said that of the six persons testing positive after getting dose 1 of the vaccine, two were reported from Mohali and one each from Patiala, Tarn Taran, Ludhiana and Sangrur. The two cases of beneficiaries testing positive after dose 2 were from Ludhiana and Mohali. All of them were vaccinated with Covishield, he added.\n\nDr Bhaskar, who himself tested positive after getting dose 2, said, \u201cIt had just been a week since I had received dose 2. A period of minimum 14 days is required for antibodies to develop after taking dose 2. No such case has been reported yet where a person tested positive after 14 days of getting dose 2.\u201d\n\nAs per the state\u2019s Covid bulletin released Thursday, 4.65 lakh doses of the vaccine have been administered in Punjab till now. A total of 2.27 lakh beneficiaries (frontline and healthcare workers) have been vaccinated with dose 1 in phase 1 and 78,439 with dose 2. In the phase 2 for 60+ population and 45+ with comorbidities, 1.59 lakh beneficiaries have been vaccinated with dose 1 in this category.\n\nExperts say that eight persons testing positive after vaccine is a \u2018miniscule and negligible\u2019 number and in fact encouraging, considering that Punjab has administered more than 4.50 lakh total doses of the vaccine.\n\nDr Madhu Gupta, professor of community medicine, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, and principal investigator for Covishield vaccine, says that the purpose of the vaccine is to decrease the severity of the disease and reduce fatalities.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it is very good news that just a miniscule number of persons have tested positive after vaccine seeing the total number of people who have been vaccinated. The efficacy of Covishield is 62 per cent. Also, it is only after 28-42 days of taking the dose 2 that antibodies are fully developed in the body, though they start generating after 14 days of dose 2. After taking dose 1, no one is immune. This miniscule number of persons testing positive after vaccine should not stop anyone from getting vaccinated. The main purpose of the vaccine is not to stop people from testing positive but to reduce deaths and hospitalisation. However, it boosts immunity and after getting dose 2, it is a possibility that majority will get immune as well.\u201d"},

Despite its length, the film has received mostly positive critical reception with a score of 76 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. The fan reception is off the charts, and this was expected since we got this only due to the fans.\n\nThe Snyder Cut, as it is referred to in the fandom, is undoubtedly better than the Joss Whedon film we got back in 2017. At more than double the runtime, it also includes footage that was left on the cutting room floor. So apart from the length, how different are the two versions?\n\nVery different, as it turns out. Even many of those scenes which are in both the versions look different as many of them were reshot under the supervision of Joss Whedon to make them more comedic and winking to the audiences.\n\nIf you are yet to see the movie, be warned. Spoilers ahead.\n\nHere are the notable differences:\n\nKnightmare scene\n\nSuperman does not look happy in the Knightmare scene. (Photo: HBO Max) Superman does not look happy in the Knightmare scene. (Photo: HBO Max)\n\nZack Snyder\u2019s Justice League features a new Knightmare scene in which the world is a wasteland subjugated by Darkseid and Superman. He rules the earth as a tyrant after Lois Lane died. Batman leads a few rebels that remain, but Superman is pursuing them. It is in this scene, which occurs at the end of the movie, we see Batman in conversation with Jared Leto\u2019s Joker. dare we say it, a great scene.\n\nNo CGI removal of Henry Cavill moustache and black suit\n\nThis is how Henry Cavill looked in Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League. (Photo: Warner Bros) This is how Henry Cavill looked in Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League. (Photo: Warner Bros)\n\nWhen Henry Cavill came back for Justice League reshoots, he was in the middle of filming Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout. In Fallout, he played the role of a moustachioed character and had grown one. To give him the clean-shaven look of Superman, VFX artists had to digitally remove the moustache and they did not have time to do it properly as the release date was close. The result was a horrifying upper lip that has spawned memes, jokes and even hashtags like #JusticeForHenryCavillsMoustache. In the Snyder Cut, we get the original footage. Superman also wears a black costume in place of the classic blue-red.\n\nLess comedic dialogue\n\nWhen it comes to banter and team chemistry, the Snyder Cut felt more lifeless than the original version. (Photo: Warner Bros) When it comes to banter and team chemistry, the Snyder Cut felt more lifeless than the original version. (Photo: Warner Bros)\n\nWhedon was brought to the project primarily due to his impeccable track record of making superhero team-up movies. Since Warner Bros thought the Snyder Cut was too dark, Whedon also had the pressure of making the film funnier. And he did his best. That is why the theatrical version felt like a collision of two visions, with the dark aesthetic and dialogue of the original, and one-liners that come out of nowhere. And it must be said, when it comes to banter and team chemistry, the Snyder Cut felt more lifeless. Whedon\u2019s version had more, and better, jokes, even if some of them did not land.\n\nNew score\n\nThomas Holkenborg or Junkie XL was originally scoring Justice League before Danny Elfman was brought in. His score was actually good. Snyder Cut brings back Junkie XL, and the results are amazing, with rock, orchestra synthesizers and wailing vocals, the latter accompanying Wonder Woman and Amazons. There is also sparing but good use of Hans Zimmer\u2019s iconic theme for Superman from Man of Steel.\n\nBetter CGI\n\nThe CGI as a whole is better in Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League, thought it is certainly not perfect. At times, you can see the imperfections, but for the most part it works. Steppenwolf\u2019s look is one thing that is actually worse this time round. Though the invader was not a perfect specimen of VFX done right in the original, he at least looked like a thinking being than somebody who fused together thousands of spikes to make up for an actual armour.\n\nFleshed-out backstories for Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman\n\nApart from the DC trinity, rest of the Justice League members felt like cardboard cut-outs, who had manifested only to complete the team in a hurry. Here, we see much more of their footage, which was left on the cutting room floor earlier. And none of it feels superfluous, though it does swell the runtime. Perhaps standalone movies on their characters would have helped matter a lot.\n\nNew characters\n\nMartian Manhunter, Darkseid, Vulko, Iris West are only a few of the characters that were removed from the theatrical version. Here, their presence helps make the world of Justice League feel bigger. The appearances may be brief, but they augment the character depth of Justice League members.\n\nDarkseid in Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League. (Photo: Warner Bros) Darkseid in Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League. (Photo: Warner Bros)\n\nMore footage, different climax and other scenes\n\nThe climactic battle in Zack Snyder\u2019s Justice League is totally different from the bland CGI-fest we saw in the theatrical version. Here, it makes much more sense and the action feels more cohesive. This film is worth watching just for that final battle. There are other scenes as well, which may have been present in Whedon version, but feel new and different this time round. There is, of course, more footage, around 2 hours worth of deleted scenes."},

Preethi Parkavi, Tiruvallur Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) and the officer of the election in Poonamalle constituency, is doing her best to achieve 100 per cent voter turnout.\n\nA few weeks ago, she visited the Adhigathur village in Tiruvallur taluk and helped the Irula, Narikurava and Arunthathiyar communities get voter IDs in a span of 10-12 days. Along with her team, Preethi set up a camp to register around a 100 people who had never voted before.\n\n\u201cI came to know of their plight when they submitted a petition seeking a Patta two months ago. They were residing in a poromboke land, and when I interacted with them I learned they don\u2019t have any government ID cards, like a ration or Aadhaar card. So, I visited the area with an E-Seva operator and issued the necessary documents. After that, I thought why can\u2019t we issue them a voter ID as well, because with Aadhaar and ration, you can apply for it. When I asked them, I was shocked to know that none from their community had exercised their right to vote. They thought they needed to submit several documents, pay money to the government and pass many procedures to attain a voter\u2019s ID. They even had apprehensions whether authorities in polling booths would allow them to vote,\u201d Preethi said.\n\n\u201cI made the EPIC operator work day and night to upload their documents within four days, before the EC website closed for applications for this year\u2019s elections. As voter ID colour cards are only printed by the Election Commission, I spoke to senior officials and got a special link to get the card downloaded in our taluk office. This happens only in special cases; I convinced them about the situation of this community and authorities were very helpful in getting the job done,\u201d she added.\n\nPreethi provides tree saplings to the Irula, Narikurava and Arunthathiyar communities after they received their voter ID cards. Preethi provides tree saplings to the Irula, Narikurava and Arunthathiyar communities after they received their voter ID cards.\n\nPreethi further said she was delighted to see the joy in the eyes of the community members. She said some of them, including a 60-year-old man was happy to be able to vote for the first time. \u201cThey were so happy to see the cards with their photographs on it. We provided them tree saplings, and asked them to plant them in front of their huts to remember that they too have an identity and rights like everyone else,\u201d she said.\n\nOn the occasion of Women\u2019s Day on March 8, a pink booth was set up at the Aringar Anna Government Higher Secondary School in the Poonamalle constituency. The school has 18 booths to accommodate 18,000 voters in their area. Preethi came to know that the polling percentage of women in the area was much lesser than men, and decided to come up with a concept of a \u2018Pink Booth\u2019, one exclusively for women voters.\n\n\u201cThis process existed even before, but not many people implemented it. I went through the previous elections and gathered data about polling percentages. I noticed that the voting percentage of women in this constituency was less. Many women think nothing is going to change by their vote and hence they avoid visiting the poll booth and sit at home to enjoy their day off. The thought process has to change. So I decided to do something to make the women voters step out and exercise their voting rights. We converted room no 312 into a women-only booth. We chose that room because it was visible from all parts of the school. We wanted to open this to the public on women\u2019s day, so two days before we started with the painting work. I was very particular that the entire room should be decked up in pink. Right from the fans, walls, tables, and even small items like pins, ribbons, everything is in pink. Five women officers were appointed exclusively for this booth; they were gifted pink sarees,\u201d added Preethi.\n\nThe pink booth at Aringar Anna Government Higher Secondary School in the Poonamalle constituency which was set up on Women\u2019s Day on March 8.

A mock voting exercise was conducted at the Pink Booth to teach women how the VPAT machines work.\n\nShe said that as per the latest guidelines issued by the government, a polling booth should have only 1,050 voters and booth number 312 had more than that and hence, it was made exclusively for women with 650 voters. On the opening day, close to 100 local women were asked to come with their voting ID and the officers conducted a mock voting exercise, thereby teaching them how VVPAT machines work. The RDO says as many as 50 women are taking part in this awareness drive.\n\nApart from this, all the hotels in her limits have been provided with voting awareness tags. The hotels have been instructed to tie these tags to the food parcels which are delivered through online food delivery aggregators. The tags will carry awareness messages like \u2018Voting is your right\u2019, \u2018Don\u2019t sell your votes\u2019, \u2018If you can\u2019t vote, you can\u2019t complain\u2019, etc.\n\n\u201cEarlier there were stickers attached to food parcels, but I thought it is of no use because people won\u2019t have time to have a look at the sticker. They will tear it and throw it away but that\u2019s not the case with the tags. I know it will annoy people because they need to make some effort to cut off the tag, and at least in those few minutes they might have a look at it. That solves our purpose.\n\n\u201cI sat for a couple of nights and came up with catchy slogans in English and Tamil. I even made the slogans in 10 different colours. A special team of officers has been formed to keep a tab on whether the hotels are adhering to the order. If any of the restaurants are found giving our parcels without tags, they will be penalized. But so far the initiative is working well, many big chain restaurants like KFC, Dominos, or Thalappakatti have been coming forward and asking us to provide more tags, they are also showing great interest,\u201d Preethi said.\n\nHotels in her limits have been provided with voting awareness tags for food parcels.

Through their dance and drama, a team of transgenders from Kovilpatti explained the importance of voting. At Nasarathpet, Preethi was involved in street campaigning. She pasted voting awareness messages on motorbikes to encourage 100 per cent voting. She also released a giant gas balloon carrying awareness messages. She is also visiting a couple of colleges to raise awareness among students.\n\nMembers of the transgender community carry out an awareness drive on the importance of voting in Poonamalle.

They think whether it is important for officers like us to take this much effort for the elections. I am doing these many things with the hope that the public will take notice of any one of these awareness campaigns and it will make them visit the polling booth to exercise their voting rights. I am confident that we will achieve 100 per cent voter turnout this time,\u201d she says."},

(Getty Images/File)\n\nFive powerful Democratic senators on Thursday urged President Joe Biden to rescind his predecessor Donald Trump\u2019s ban on some non-immigrant visas, including the H-1B visa which is popular among Indian IT professionals, saying this creates uncertainties for US employers, their foreign-born professional workers and their families.\n\nIn June 2020, Trump instituted Proclamation 10052, halting the processing of non-immigrant H-1B, L-1, H-2B, and J-1 visas, based on the alleged potential risk to the labour market.\n\nAlthough Proclamation 10052 is set to expire on March 31, 2021, businesses have indicated that inaction will further harm their businesses and economic recovery.\n\nThe senators said that because the visas that Proclamation 10052 halted either target low-unemployment professions or require that the visa holder does not displace an American worker, businesses that rely on foreign workers have struggled to fill jobs despite increased unemployment.\n\nReports have suggested that jobs in fields such as information technology \u2014 which H-1B visa holders would have filled \u2014 have remained open or were moved overseas, said senators Michael Bennet, Jeanne Shaheen, Angus King, Cory Booker, and Bob Menendez.\n\nThe H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.\n\nTechnology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.\n\n\u201cThe continuation of this ban creates delays and uncertainties for US employers, their foreign-born professional workers, and their families,\u201d wrote the senators in a letter to President Biden.\n\n\u201cRather than attracting talented individuals to the United States, allowing these bans to remain in effect makes the immigration system harder to navigate and drives foreign talent to other countries,\u201d they wrote.\n\nAdditionally, many businesses in seasonal communities that Proclamation 10052 has affected rely on foreign workers to meet the demand of the high-visitation summer months.\n\nFailing to revoke the visa ban immediately threatens both workers and employers in these communities who cannot adequately and safely prepare for the surge season, they said.\n\n\u201cEvery day these visa bans remain in place undermines our collective vision for a new, more prosperous and welcoming nation. We urge you to follow through on your promise to rescind Proclamation 10052 without delay, resume timely processing of nonimmigrant visas, and direct US Embassies and Consulates to open up visa appointments for nonimmigrant visas as soon as possible,\u201d the senators wrote.\n\nDespite the increased unemployment due to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), businesses that rely on foreign workers struggled to fill jobs as the nonimmigrant categories affected by PP10052 either target low-unemployment professions (e.g., H-1B and L-1 visas) or require that the nonimmigrant will not displace an American worker (e.g., H-2B, J-1), the senators wrote.\n\nThe H-2B programme allows US employers or agents \u201cto bring foreign nationals to the United States to fill temporary nonagricultural jobs.\u201d\n\nSeveral of these categories (H-2B and J-1 Summer Work Travel and Camp Counselor) by regulation are seasonal and heavily used during the summer months when seasonal communities across the country welcome an influx of visitors.\n\nThe J-1 visa is an exchange visitor visa for individuals approved to participate in work-and-study-based exchange visitor programmes in the United States.\n\nThe L-1 Visa is reserved for managerial or executive professionals transferring to the US from within the same company, or a subsidiary of it.\n\n\u201cFailing to revoke the Proclamation immediately places these programmes at risk because both workers and employers cannot adequately prepare for the surge season,\u201d they wrote.\n\nLooking ahead to long-term economic recovery, the deficit of foreign workers to fill available American tech jobs will worsen through any further lack of access to foreign talent, they said.\n\nReports also suggest that many jobs in fields such as information technology that would have been filled by H-1B nonimmigrants have remained open or were moved permanently overseas.\n\n\u201cMoreover, these same businesses have also noted that Proclamation 10052, coupled with defunct executive orders, has kept U.S. citizens and permanent residents separated from their parents, adult children, and siblings,\u201d the senators wrote.\n\n\u201cWe believe that it\u2019s possible to continue processing these visas while also preventing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Admittedly, Yamaguchi runs into Sindhu on the back of a long layoff dating back to last All England.\n\nThe one exception to be seriously considered though, is Japan\u2019s National championship, where she lost 22-20 in the third to Nozomi Okuhara. The senior Japanese has spent most of 2020 training in lockdown at Olympics\u2019 Ground Zero improving her footwork to deal with Yamaguchi\u2019s tricky returns.\n\nSo Sindhu might want to remember that opponents from powerhouses like Japan, have no dearth of competitive domestic sparring. So Yamaguchi\u2019s relative rustiness might not be the comfort to lean on.\n\nSindhu leads Yamaguchi 10-7. She\u2019s become a World Champion since that particular statistic froze. But the tricky returns that Okuhara is fixated on, are bubbling like always in Yamaguchi\u2019s repertoire.\n\nSindhu\u2019s reach can torment Yamaguchi. Her aggression, not as much as it works against the relatively shorter players like Okuhara, Chen Yufei and Tai Tzu Ying. For Yamaguchi brings her own attack into the mix. She has a respectable smash kill and a defense that may leak points initially when Sindhu powers her cross-court deep smashes along the lines. But Yamaguchi likes her back and forths: a string of deflated errors is not exactly what she concedes. There will be resistance even if Sindhu takes off in one of her rampaging starts.\n\nPlaying her first match, Yamaguchi had frowned about the air-conditioning and drift irritating her, till the end of the match she won 14, 17. No audience means the winds blow \u201chere and there\u201d like Sindhu herself pointed out.\n\nIt will be an exciting pitting of wits between the two women, who\u2019ve never won All England, and are being guided by Korean coaches. Both are fresh relatively, not really stretched in their outings the last two days. Both believe in sweetly conveying that there will be no quarter given.\n\nBig Mark Caljouw stands in Sen\u2019s way to semis\n\nLakshya Sen ought to start as favourite against World No 36 Mark Caljouw. (File) Lakshya Sen ought to start as favourite against World No 36 Mark Caljouw. (File)\n\nA hulking Dutchman Mark Caljouw stands in the way of Lakshya Sen making the All England semis in only his second outing at Birmingham.\n\n\u201cHe should mentally be prepared for a long match.The Dutch guy is big and has a good defense. Lakshya should not get desperate and should attack at the right time,\u201d Sen\u2019s coach Vimal Kumar said.\n\nSen\u2019s last match at 2020\u2019s All England was against Viktor Axelsen, who posed a similar problem to the Indian. \u201cHe has a good defense and has been playing well. He got the better of Prannoy in the Swiss Open last week,\u201d he added.\n\nLakshya tends to get a bit frustrated against retrievers. \u201cHe is very tall and has a good hit as well. He has beaten Lakshya in one of the PBL games,\u201d the coach added.\n\nIt\u2019s been a torrid 6 months for Lakshya, starting with Germany where his father would test positive, and Lakshya wasbarred from playing. \u201cLakshya has nothing to lose and a win can give him a lot of confidence considering the misery he went through last 6 months. Back injury, COVID,\u201d Vimal said.\n\nBut at Birmingham, he\u2019s looked in good touch. \u201cHe has no issues last 3 weeks and when he played in the Swiss he just did not have the confidence. Hope a few wins and more matches can help him play at a similar level like early last year,\u201d the coach said.\n\nSen ought to start as favourite against World No 36 Caljouw, four years his senior. Ranked at No 28, Sen will back himself to make the semis, given the confident manner in which he has strided forward against Kantaphon Wangcharoen and Thomas Rouxel on two consecutive days.\n\nHistorically prone to fading off as the match progressed, Sen has shown massive improvements in grabbing the initiative and finishing the job with his mix of aggression and a solid end-game.\n\nWhat he will need to guard against when taking on the Dutch shuttler, is the relative ease with which Caljouw can tackle Indian players.\n\nHe is on 8-3 wins against Indians in the last four years, and tends to play a disarming, harmless game, chipping away before shifting gears to bring in the bulk.\n\nSen, who\u2019s looked solid, minus any hiccups, will relish the opportunity to make his maiden semis and is capable of playing the composed game. And break the chain of Indians who seem to end up on the losing side against Caljouw."},

Many viewed the shooting rampage in Atlanta that left eight people dead as the culmination of a racialized misogyny that they say has long been directed at them. (Shuran Huang/The New York Times)\n\nWritten by Shaila Dewan\n\nAfter eight people, six of them Asian women, were fatally shot this week in a rampage near Atlanta, a law enforcement official said that in the gunman\u2019s own words, his actions were \u201cnot racially motivated,\u201d but caused by \u201csexual addiction.\u201d\n\nThe official, Capt. Jay Baker of the Sheriff\u2019s Office in Cherokee County, where one of the three massage businesses targeted by the gunman was located, cautioned that the investigation of the shootings at three massage businesses was in its early stages. But the implication was clear: It had to be one motive or the other, not both.\n\nThat suggestion was met with incredulity by many Asian American women, for whom racism and sexism have always been inextricably intertwined. For them, racism often takes the form of unwanted sexual come-ons, and sexual harassment is often overtly racist.\n\nWith reports of anti-Asian attacks surging after the Trump administration repeatedly empasized China\u2019s connection to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is evidence that most of the hate, unlike other types of bias crime, has been directed at women.\n\nFlowers and signs are displayed at a makeshift memorial outside of the Gold Spa in Atlanta, Wednesday, March 17, 2021. (Photo: Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP) Flowers and signs are displayed at a makeshift memorial outside of the Gold Spa in Atlanta, Wednesday, March 17, 2021. (Photo: Alyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\n\u201cPeople on here literally debating if this was a misogynistic attack against women or a racist attack against Asians,\u201d Jenn Fang, founder of a long-running Asian American feminist blog, Reappropriate, wrote in a scathing Twitter thread. \u201cWhat if \u2014 wait for it \u2014 it was both.\u201d\n\nBaker\u2019s briefing on Wednesday included an assertion that the accused gunman, who is white, had been having \u201ca really bad day,\u201d which many women took as yet another way of excusing violence against them. His comments were widely criticized, and he was found to have promoted sales of an anti-Asian T-shirt.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement and society in general tends to really not understand how racism and hate and prejudice is directed toward Asian Americans, and certainly not understand how it\u2019s directed toward Asian American women,\u201d said Helen Zia, an activist and author who has tracked anti-Asian violence. \u201cSo the instant reaction is generally to discount and dismiss it.\u201d\n\nSung Yeon Choimorrow, executive director of the National Asian Pacific American Women\u2019s Forum, an advocacy group, said that when she first came to the United States to attend college in 2000, she was \u201cstunned, dumbfounded, horrified\u201d by the way she was frequently approached by male strangers who professed to love Korean women.\n\n\u201cIt is the \u2018Me so horny, I love you long time,\u2019 in like weird accents, and \u2018Oh, are you Korean? I love Korea,\u2019\u201d she said, adding that she began to wonder if American men were crazy. They would \u201cgo into this whole thing about how they served in the military in Korea and how they had this amazing Korean girlfriend that was just like me. And will I be their girlfriend?\u201d\n\nThe men, she said, ranged in age from the very young to the very old, and seemed never to understand that their attention was not flattering. \u201cI\u2019ve experienced racism. I\u2019ve experienced sexism. But I never experienced the two like that as I have when I came to the United States.\u201d\n\nShe said many Asian American women viewed Tuesday\u2019s shooting rampage as the culmination of this racialized misogyny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m telling you, most of us didn\u2019t sleep well last night,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause this was what we had feared all along \u2014 we were afraid that the objectification and the hypersexualization of our bodies was going to lead to death.\u201d\n\nFederal data suggest that across the country, the victims of most violent hate crimes are men. Yet a recent analysis by a group called Stop AAPI Hate, which collects reports of hate incidents against Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, said that out of nearly 3,800 incidents recorded in 2020 and 2021, more than two-thirds of the reports came from women.\n\nHate crimes against Asian women are almost certainly undercounted, and Zia said one reason is that those with a sexual dimension tend to be classified as sex offenses, in effect erasing the racial aspect. Stereotypes of Asian women as submissive may embolden aggressors, she said. \u201cWe\u2019re seen as vulnerable,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know \u2014 the object that won\u2019t fight back.\u201d\n\nVery little is known about the motives of the Atlanta gunman, but organizations that track hate crimes have paid increasing attention to misogyny as a \u201cgateway drug\u201d to other types of extremism, such as violent racism, in the wake of mass shootings at yoga and fitness studios frequented by women and the slaughter of 10 people in Toronto in 2018 by a self-described \u201cincel,\u201d or involuntary celibate.\n\nKyeyoung Park, a professor of anthropology and Asian American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, said Asian immigrants have historically been viewed exclusively through the lens of their labor or businesses.\n\nIn the case of the spas in Georgia, she said capitalism based on racial exploitation has been intertwined with the sexualization of Asian women, and particularly Korean women, over many decades. The police have not said whether any of the three spas had ties to sex work.\n\n\u201cI think the origin of these massage parlors can be traced back to Korean War brides and military wives,\u201d Park said.\n\nOverseas, poverty and the privations of war gave rise to a prostitution industry that provided inexpensive sex to U.S. servicemen in Korea, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam, compounding stereotypes of Asian women as exotic sex objects or manipulators trying to entrap American husbands.\n\nSexual imperialism was not limited to Americans; the Japanese also forced Chinese, Filipino and Korean women into prostitution as so-called \u201ccomfort women\u201d in the 1930s and \u201940s.\n\nMany women who were in the sex trade were brought to the United States as brides, and some of them who were later separated or divorced from their husbands started massage parlors, a history that likely helped shape a perception of all Asian-run spas as illicit and the women who work in them as sex workers, Park said.\n\nThe fetishization of Asian women was reinforced in popular culture, most notably with the lines spoken by a sex worker in a scene in \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d a Vietnam War movie, as two soldiers try to bargain down her price: \u201cMe so horny. Me love you long time.\u201d\n\nDivorced from their origin, those lines have become a come-on used in what Ellen Wu, a historian at Indiana University Bloomington and author of \u201cThe Color of Success: Asian-Americans and the Origins of the Model Minority,\u201d called a \u201cracially specific type of catcalling.\u201d\n\n\u201cA few words pack an entire history into a sentence,\u201d she said."},

A number of tests have been developed to confirm the cause of such deaths with the diatom test emerging as one of the most important tests. The test entails findings if there are diatoms in the body being tested. Diatoms are photosynthesizing algae which are found in almost every aquatic environment including fresh and marine waters, soils, in fact, almost anywhere moist.\n\nWhat is the science behind the diatom test\n\nA body recovered from a water body does not necessarily imply that the death was due to drowning. If the person is alive when he enters the water, the diatoms will enter the lungs when the person inhales water while drowning. These diatoms then get carried to various parts of the body, including the brain, kidneys, lungs and bone marrow by blood circulation. If a person is dead when is thrown in the water, then there is no circulation and there is no transport of diatom cells to various organs.\n\nDiatom analysis is considered positive only when the number of diatoms recovered from the body is more than a minimal established limit. Forensic experts also correlate the diatoms extracted from the body and the samples obtained from the water body where the drowning took place to ascertain the place of drowning. \u201cThe result of a diatom test will be different if a person is thrown in the water after he is dead,\u201d Dr S C Mohite, Professor and Head of the Department of Forensic Medicine, told The Indian Express.\n\nAlso in Explained | How Mumbai Police reinstated Sachin Waze after 16 years despite a court order\n\nIs the Diatom test reliable?\n\n\u201cYes. It is reliable unless and until the deceased person has been drinking water from the same source of water before his death. For example, a person is drinking water from a well, then the diatoms from the well will be found in the body and so if he has drowned in the same well, then the diatom test will not be reliable.\n\nAlso, the test will be negative if the person died instantly after falling into the water,\u201d said Mohite. He added that the diatom test need not be done if classical signs of drowning \u2014 like froth at mouth and nostrils, cadaveric spasm, presence of water from drowning medium is seen in stomach and oedema of lungs \u2014 are present.\n\nWhat have the ATS found so far in Mansukh Hiran\u2019s case?\n\nThe body of Hiran, who knew how to swim, was found with a cloth mask around his mouth, and the mouth was stuffed with pieces of cloth.

A diatom test was done at JJ Hospital\u2019s forensic laboratory, which has remained inconclusive.

Now, author Dr Sheetal Nair is back with his latest offering \u2014 The Monk\u2019s Secret \u2014 which is a summation of techniques used by various psychologists, management gurus, spiritual gurus and entrepreneurs to successfully manage one\u2019s life in the best possible manner, especially reflecting on life in a pandemic.\n\nIn an interview with indianexpress.com, the 34-year-old \u2014 for whom \u201cit is the value of everyday experiences and how we as a race should change our perspectives to deal with life\u201d is what truly counts \u2014 explains more about his thought process, the self-help literature genre, and how all of us can learn to \u201cenjoy life\u201d.\n\nCan you describe your journey to becoming an author?\n\nI\u2019ve always loved reading. Being a single child, books were the perfect companion for me. Growing up, Charles Dickens and O\u2019 Henry had a huge impact on me, the way they showed the protagonist\u2019s struggle and their relationships helped me understand how to navigate life. The impact these books, which were published years before my birth, had on me made me realise the power of words. I started off small by contributing to children\u2019s magazines and then later onto reputed publications for my research work. And finally, I struck gold with my first bestseller.\n\nWhat is the idea behind your new book?\n\nI can say day-to-day experiences. I usually channelise what is happening around me or affecting people in general. Like my first book, The Midas Touch, was written when I realised trainers today had lost the meaning of real leadership, and they kept harping on concepts that had become outdated. My second book was a result of the pandemic and the mental impact it had on people; the negativity which had engulfed us as a race was beyond imagination. I felt that we as a race should focus on the positives and change our perspective. I\u2019m inspired by the people around me and the situations they find themselves in.\n\nThe best part about them is that even though it\u2019s a non-fiction work you shall feel that it\u2019s like a story being narrated in first person with live examples for you to read, understand and implement.\n\nWhy did you decide to pursue the self-help book genre?\n\nWe are going through a time wherein so many changes are happening around us. It\u2019s a volatile and uncertain world or as behavioural scientists call it a \u201cVUCA\u201d (volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity) world. With so many changes, the feeling that we all are lost is something that our entire race feels at some point or the other and I can vouch for a fact that you can ask any adult point-blank and they would affirm that they must have gone through at least one self-help book in their lifetime. This made me realise that the impact which I yearned to have will be magnified if I start addressing this genre of books. And hence the choice was clear.\n\nThere are a lot of self-help books available. How is your book different from the rest?\n\nFirst and foremost, let me make a controversial declaration: my books are exactly similar to every self-help book you find around the corner. I don\u2019t claim to be a stand-out in content. But, where my books differ is in delivery. Being a trainer and a coach, I have been able to simplify and explain the complicated concepts in a very simple language that can be comprehended by a layman. This is the lesson I learn from my first book which was very content heavy and I ended up curating a book that is both enjoyable as a read while also teaching you concepts that you can hold close to your heart.\n\nALSO READ | Twenty-one of our top picks to read in 2021\n\nDo \u2018monk\u2019 and self-help book titles go hand-in-hand?\n\nThe idea was to showcase whatever I have learned from my mentors and peers in the book. And I always have felt that these mentors are like my spiritual gurus whose thoughts and ideas have guided me through the thick and thin of life per se, and not too many people were able to acquire the same since their perspectives weren\u2019t the same as ours. These ideas led me to the title The Monk\u2019s Secret.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nI\u2019ve started my research on two topics, one which focuses on the impact spirituality has on our businesses, and the other on how our old architectural systems have survived the test of the times.\n\nFor more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"},

Just a day earlier, BJP national president J P Nadda had announced at a poll rally that if the party came to power in West Bengal, it would provide reservation in the OBC category for these communities.\n\nThe OBC vote\n\nThe 2019 Lok Sabha results indicated major gains by the BJP in areas dominated by SCs, STs and OBCs, specifically in south Bengal, where this helped the party crack the stronghold of the Trinamool. If the transfer of SC/ST votes helped the BJP get better results in Jangalmahal and North 24 Parganas and Nadia districts, the shift of OBC votes helped the party win seats in districts like East and West Midnapore, Hooghly and Howrah.\n\nIf the BJP is now trying to consolidate this hold, the Trinamool is hoping the promise of reservation will return the OBCs to it.\n\nMamata govt\u2019s OBC policy\n\nOne year after assuming power for the first time, the Trinamool government in 2012 passed the West Bengal Backward Classes (other than SC and ST) (Reservation of Vacancies in Services and Posts) Bill, 2012, paving the way for reservation for some OBC castes. All Muslim communities except Siddiquis and Sayads are included as OBC A or OBC B in the list. In case of Hindus, Kansaris, Kahars, Middes, Kapalis, Karmakars, Kumbhakars, Kurmis, Majhis, Modaks, Napits, Sutradhars, Swarnakars, Telis and Kolus were included in the OBC list.\n\nAccording to the Backward Classes Welfare Department of the West Bengal government, it has issued almost 38 lakh OBC certificates. Recently, the government claimed to have enrolled thousands more under the Duare Sarkar (doorstep government) programme.\n\nAt the time, groups like Mahisyas (a dominant community), Tomars, Tilis and Sahas were excluded from the OBC category as it was believed that these communities are privileged and already part of the mainstream.\n\nWest Bengal minister Firhad Hakim said the Trinamool\u2019s manifesto promise was not aimed at gaining a vote bank. \u201cMamata Banerjee is always eager to do something for the downtrodden. She assured food, home and health security for them. Now, many new groups are demanding the same as they are \u2018pichhra\u2019. We have decided to consider this and our government will decide whether they are eligible to be included in the OBC list or not.\u201d\n\nBJP spokeperson Samik Bhattacharya said their promise couldn\u2019t be equated with \u201cthe divisive politics of the Trinamool\u201d. \u201cWe had already announced that those who are eligible to get reservation as per the Mandal Commission, we will give it.

Birendranath Sashmal, Sushil Dhara and Satish Samanta are leaders belonging to these groups who led the freedom movement against the British in the area, even forming a \u2018Tamralipta Jatiya Sarkar\u2019, an \u201cindependent parallel government\u201d, during the Quit India Movement. It functioned from December 17, 1942, to August 8, 1944, setting up police stations and even a system for revenue collection.\n\nMidnapore, which is part of this pocket, includes Nandigram from where Mamata Banerjee is herself contesting this time. Her rival from the seat and former close aide Suvendu Adhikari also counts the East and West Midnapore region among his strongholds.\n\nFrom the beginning of his campaign, Adhikari has been harping on his Midnapore identity and paying homage to leaders like Dhara, Samanta, Sashmal \u2014 in line with the BJP\u2019s successful invocation of local, little-known leaders across the country."},

He referred to \u201cmassive new measures\u201d to \u201cslow down (the virus) without locking down people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI also know the deep wish of many of you to enjoy the outdoors, since the crisis has gone on for one year and Spring is coming,\u201d Castex said.\n\nHe also announced that the French would be able to get inoculated with the AstraZeneca vaccine starting Friday afternoon, and that he himself will be getting a shot \u201cto show we can have complete confidence.\u201d\n\nCastex is making for himself an exception to the age rule, moving to the front of the line of those awaiting vaccinations, currently reserved for people 75 and older or with serious health concerns.\n\nFrance and some other countries briefly suspended use of the vaccine over fears of blood clots, and are resuming it after the European Medicines Agency gave its green light earlier Thursday.\n\nCastex said France faces a \u201cthird wave\u201d of the pandemic, with three-quarters of new cases from the more contagious variant that originated in Britain, and more patients who are younger and in better health.\n\n\u201cThe situation is deteriorating,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Paris region has an infection rate of 446 out of 100,000 inhabitants, up more than 23 per cent in a week, Castex said, and intensive care units are close to saturation. Northern France has an incidence rate of 381 in 100,000. France\u2019s nationwide infection rate is about 250 per 100,000.\n\nBut the prime minister insisted that France was sticking to its \u201cthird way\u201d of dealing with the virus: \u201cPragmatic, proportional and regional,\u201d targeting problematic areas.\n\nThe Nice area and, in the north, the Pas de Calais and Dunkirk region, have been in full weekend lockdowns. The north, the Paris region and several others are now being targeted, but with a mix of carrot and stick measures.\n\nPeople all over France have been under a 6 pm to 6 am nationwide curfew for two months. The curfew will now begin an hour later.\n\nIn addition, restaurants, bars, cinemas, gyms, museums, theaters and concert halls have been shut down for almost five months, and will remain closed.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government had hoped the measures already in place would spare the country of 67 million from the economic, social and psychological impact of another lockdown.\n\nYet confirmed infections and demand for ICU beds have both risen steadily in recent weeks. The UK virus variant accounts for most infections, and around 250 people are dying each day from the virus.\n\n\u201cWe see people dying, we see people suffering\u2026.There\u2019s a difficult situation.. and we don\u2019t feel an appropriate response,\u201d Enrique Casalino, head of the emergency service at Bichat hospital, Paris, told French broadcaster LCI.\n\nGovernment spokesperson Gabriel Attal had warned Wednesday that the new measures to be announced Thursday could include lockdowns in the Paris region, which is home to 12 million people, and in Hauts-de-France, the region bordering Belgium in northern France.\n\n\u201cA localized strategy remains a good strategy. It enables (us) to limit precisely and proportionally the spread of the virus,\u201d he said."},

Holding a 12-0 record, the WBO Asia-Pacific Super Middleweight champion will take on Russian pro Artysh Lopsan in an eight-round bout in Goa, on a casino ship, at 8 pm Friday. The fight will not be telecast on any television channel and will instead be cast on BookMyShow for a pay-per-view cost of Rs 99. Vijender Singh\u2019s promoter confirmed that there will be a delayed broadcast of the three-hour event on Sony a week later.\n\nNewsletter | Click to get the day\u2019s best explainers in your inbox\n\nWhat is the pay-per-view model?\n\nThis will be the first time in India a major sport event is opting for the globally popular pay-per-view model. Usually, a consumer pays the network to watch events that the network holds the rights for. Most professional sports or events in India involve stakeholders \u2014 like BCCI, in the case of cricket \u2014 selling rights to networks/broadcasters. The onus to promote, market and sell advertisement slots is on the network. From a fan\u2019s point of view, pay-per-view means paying for just that one event and not for all the shows on the channel. This practice is very popular around the world, especially for combat sports like boxing and mixed martial arts.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 JOIN NOW \ud83d\udce3: The Express Explained Telegram Channel\n\nHow popular are pay-per-view sports events in India?\n\nIt\u2019s an unchartered territory. During lockdown with movie halls shut, BookMyShow started to stream movies and other entertainment content on a pay-per-view model. While they have a catalogue of movies and content to choose from, a live boxing event will be their first foray into sports.\n\nVijender Singh along with Russia\u2019s Artysh Lopsan during a press conference in New Delhi on Friday, March 12, 2021. (PTI Photo/Kamal Singh) Vijender Singh along with Russia\u2019s Artysh Lopsan during a press conference in New Delhi on Friday, March 12, 2021. (PTI Photo/Kamal Singh)\n\nWhy is Vijender Singh\u2019s fight on pay-per-view?\n\nThe lockdown\u2019s impact on live sports is well-documented. Vijender, who is also signed to Bob Arum\u2019s Top Rank Boxing, was unable to find a fight in the United States, United Kingdom or Dubai. Even in India most sports events were being held without spectators behind closed doors. In the ongoing India-England cricket series, the BCCI had to roll back their decision to allow fans inside the stadium after a surge in COVID-19 cases in Ahmedabad.\n\nA \u201cpay-per-view online event\u201d is a perfect pandemic-time business model for live sports. Looking ahead, his promoters IOS Sports and Entertainment have plans to slot his fight outside India this year. Following a 15-month layoff (pandemic-related), the boxer donned his gloves again in January to start preparing for the fight in March. The Indian boxer is expected to bag a fight outside the country around June-July.\n\nAlso in Explained | Would long jumper Sreeshankar have won an Olympic medal with his 8.26 metre jump?\n\nWhat numbers are expected for the pay-per-view fight?\n\nVijender\u2019s Indian fights are being promoted by IOS. CEO Neerav Tomar said there was an element of unpredictability because nothing like this has been done before in India. \u201cThe fight business is completely dependent on the stardom of the fighter. We are fortunate to have a big star in Vijender. We have a Mary Kom, we have a Sushil Kumar, but Vijender is the only pro fighter who is a big name. It all starts from how many consumers a fighter can draw. Then you convert that into sponsors, gate revenue and television revenue,\u201d Tomar said.\n\nTomar also said that the pay-per-view numbers will be revealed after the fight. \u201cWe are expecting people to purchase the pay-per-view on the 19th itself. The Indian consumer market is very time-to-the-event oriented. They never buy an event or a ticket in advance like the European or American market. As for the price it\u2019s not a big amount, but a respectable amount. There are 8 crore people in the country who are on Bookmyshow so it\u2019s accessible to everyone.\u201d\n\nWhat are the chances of success for the pay-per-view model in India?\n\nNot everyone shares the same optimism as Tomar. Percept\u2019s Shailendra Singh, Vijender\u2019s manager for his previous professional fights believes that forcing an Indian audience to buy into the concept of a pay-per-view is one that will not work.\n\n\u201cThe entertainment sector survives on freebies. When I did my first Fight Night and second Fight Night with Vijender in Pune and Delhi, most of the guests were stars and the model was based on sponsorships. It\u2019s a mindset issue. The Indian audience is very weird. They could replace a boxing match with a cricket match and a cricket match with a Salman Khan movie at 9pm \u2013 there is no loyalty and they treat sport as entertainment,\u201d Shailendra said.\n\nCiting the example of telecom companies trying to get into the business of live content in India, he added, \u201cI would rather do a deal for this particular bout with Airtel or Jio and say that everyone on Airtel or Jio can watch this match for free and take my pay-per-view revenue from Airtel and Jio because they are looking for content. Why would I individually and conceptually put pressure on an audience to understand the idea of pay-per-views and risk it?\u201d"},

(Representational/Pixabay)\n\nSouth Africa has been ranked as the world\u2019s most dangerous country to drive in while India came in at fourth place, according to a research study undertaken by international driver education company Zutobi.\n\nAmong the list of 56 countries in the study, Thailand came in second position and the US took up third spot.\n\nThe safest roads in the world can be found in Norway, with its Scandinavian neighbour Sweden having the third safest roads while Japan took second place, according to the study.\n\n\u201cWe analysed each country on five factors, giving each one a normalised score out of ten for each factor, before taking an average final score across all five factors,\u201d Zutobi said.\n\nThese factors included estimates on the number of road traffic deaths per 100,000 population; the percentage of car occupants who use a seat-belt when travelling in the front of a vehicle; and the proportion of road traffic deaths which have been attributed to alcohol consumption over the national legal limit.\n\nThese estimates were based on the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Health Observatory data repository.\n\nThe maximum speed limit on motorway and blood alcohol content restrictions in the various countries were also taken into account.\n\nBut Zutobi\u2019s findings have been challenged by the Justice Project SA (JPSA), an NGO that aims to improve road traffic laws and their enforcement in South Africa.\n\nJPSA Chairperson Howard Dembovsky, while agreeing that South Africans tended to be poor drivers, said that Zutobi had used outdated figures in its study.\n\nDembovsky also queried why South Africa was the only African country in its list.\n\n\u201cSo to accuse us of being the worst in the world is a little bit unfair. If you are going to talk about the worst countries in the world, then you need to adopt a balanced approach,\u201d Dembovsky said as he commented on poor driving in his country in an interview with radio station Cape Talk.\n\n\u201c(South African drivers) do have a shocking road safety record. As much as I would not place much reliance on that so-called study, there is still plenty of evidence to show that South Africans are dangerous drivers and inconsiderate drivers and have very little regard for the safety of others on our roads,\u201d he said."},

(Archive)\n\nShops selling meat in areas under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) will remain closed on Tuesdays, with a proposal to this effect being passed by the civic body during its house meeting on Thursday. The MCG also approved proposals to double the licence fee for meat shops from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000, and to increase the penalty for running such shops illegally to 10 times what it was earlier \u2013 from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000.\n\nAlthough the matter on the agenda in the context of meat shops was only regarding an increase in licence fee and clamping down on illegal meat shops, the decision to prohibit sale of meat on Tuesdays was made after some councillors put forth suggestions to this effect citing \u201cHindu sentiments\u201d. The suggestion also found the support of Mayor Madhu Azad, who said, \u201cThey are completely right, we are all agreed that meat shops remain closed on Tuesdays.\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite MCG Commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh pointing out that \u201cfood is an independent choice\u201d, the proposal was passed by the House. \u201cIn my opinion, this is an individual choice. I eat, my wife doesn\u2019t eat, it is independent. I cannot force her and she cannot force me\u2026 When we cannot decide on this at home itself, the House should think before making any decision regarding the entire city,\u201d said Singh during the meeting.\n\nThe decision to double the licence fee for meat shops and increase penalty for illegal shops was made after a heated discussion that saw some councillors demanding that the license fee be set as high as Rs 50,000.\n\nThe MCG Commissioner suggested that while a \u201creasonable\u201d increase may be made in the licence fee, instead of increasing it to an extent \u201cthat everything closes\u201d, the fine should be increased from Rs 500 to Rs 5,000.\n\nSpeaking after the meeting, Singh said, \u201cIn the meeting, along with increasing the fees for sale of meat licence, the penalty imposed on those selling meat illegally was also increased. Along with this, shops that are penalised three times will be sealed. If the owners are found to have broken the seal, an FIR will be filed against them.\u201d\n\nAt the meeting, Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of the MCG, Ashish Singla, stated that the civic body had started granting licences to meat shops in 2017: \u201cIn that year, we had issued 129 licences, most in commercial areas\u2026 After March 2018, we have not issued any new licences.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Indian Express earlier this week, an official from the MCG had stated that the proposal to double licence fee for meat shops had been made purely to \u201cadd to the revenue\u201d of the MCG.\n\nMeat shops owners, meanwhile, fear the decisions will leave them in a lurch at a time when \u201cthere is not so much work to begin with\u201d.\n\n\u201cRs 10,000 is a lot, considering it has to be given annually to renew the licence. At the same time, they have also decided to further reduce our business. Members of one community may not consume meat on Tuesdays, but we still get business from other communities, it\u2019s a big loss for us\u2026 We will have to follow the rules and manage somehow,\u201d said Pritam Bhagat of the Jacobpura Meat Market Association."},

In Mumbai, petrol is retailing at Rs 97.57, while diesel costs Rs 88.60, data available on Indian Oil Corporation\u2019s website showed.\n\nIn the first two months of 2021, petrol price went up by Rs 4.87 per litre while diesel rates increased by Rs 4.99.\n\nFuel prices differ from state to state as taxes get levied on them by both central as well as state governments along with the freight charges.\n\nThe central and state taxes make up for 60 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and over 54 per cent of diesel. Centre levies Rs 32.90 per litre of excise duty on petrol and Rs 31.80 a litre on diesel.\n\nThe fuel prices are generally revised on a daily basis in line with benchmark international price and foreign exchange rates.\n\nIn the global market, oil prices edged up on Friday, but were still down more than 8 per cent for the week as a new wave of COVID-19 infections across Europe spurred fresh lockdowns and dampened hopes that an anticipated recovery in fuel demand would come soon, Reuters reported.\n\nPrices plunged 7 per cent on Thursday, falling for a fifth day in a row amid concerns about slowing vaccination programmes in Europe, even if infections have plummeted in the United States, the worst-hit country and biggest crude consumer, the news agency said.\n\nUS crude was up 10 cents (0.2 per cent) at $60.10 a barrel by 0233 GMT. Brent crude was up 18 cents (0.3 per cent) at $63.46 a barrel, the report said."},

How often do you hear a story about a talented storyteller, who got famous on TV before he or she went on to make it big in the movies in India? The Tamil film industry owes a great deal to Naalaya Iyakunar, a popular talent show on Kalaignar TV. The platform identified fresh talents who defined the last decade of Tamil cinema.\n\nFilmmaker-writer Karthik Subbaraj, who is celebrating his 38th birthday today, was discovered on the show. His transition from a software engineer to Tamil movie\u2019s top filmmaker is the stuff stories are made of. He quit his high-paying job and passed up an opportunity to settle down in France to pursue his passion for cinema. It was a great leap of faith, which paid off handsomely.\n\nKarthik quit his job after he was selected as a participant of Naalaya Iyakunar. And he never failed to impress the judges and audience week after week with his short films. He made his first feature film titled Pizza in 2012. And today \u2018A Karthik Subbaraj Film\u2019 is a brand in itself that draws the audience to the box office, irrespective of which star is playing the lead role. If the star headlining his movie is Rajinikanth or Vikram, it is a bonus.\n\nOn his birthday here\u2019s every film by him, ranked. Karthik has made five feature movies so far, excluding the short segments he helmed for anthologies Bench Talkies and Putham Pudhu Kaalai. And his latest movie Jagame Thandhiram is yet to release, so it is not taken into account.\n\n5. Mercury\n\nMercury is a silent thriller directed by Karthik Subbaraj Mercury is a silent thriller directed by Karthik Subbaraj\n\nWith no dialogues and a heavy subject, Mercury highlights the plight of the less privileged who have to pay the price for development. Set in a picturesque background, the horror film revolves around environmental destruction by corporate greed and its lifelong consequences that innocents suffer.\n\nYou can watch this film on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n4. Iraivi\n\nOn the surface, it is a story about a group of men who dig their own grave because of momentary lapses in their judgements. But, look closer, it is mainly a commentary on masculinity and how it has come to define every aspect of our life. In this film, Karthik also shows how society has accepted the institutionalised oppression of women for over many generations. And how families normalise inequality between men and women. Stereotyping gender roles, demanding women to show superhuman tolerance to all the indiscretions of men, rescuer syndrome, and regret of old age, Karthik probes into all the tenets of a male-centric society in this film. And the film is further elevated by performances of a high-calibre star cast.\n\n3. Petta\n\nRajinikanth in Petta. Rajinikanth in Petta.\n\nThis film was a fresh breath of air in the cluster of Rajinikanth films that we got in the last decade. Karthik achieved a breakthrough of sorts in bringing \u2018vintage Rajini\u2019 back on the screen. And redefined how modern Rajinikanth films are made. Petta was the filmmaker taking a nostalgic trip down memory lane dotted with old Rajinikanth films. The actor\u2019s nostalgia is now a genre in itself. In this film, Rajinikanth played a character who was gentle, villainous, funny and very pragmatic. His character was larger-than-life, yet human.\n\nYou can watch this film on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n2. Pizza\n\nThis is the film that put Karthik on the map. It came at a time when small-budget movies were making big gains at the box office in Tamil Nadu. It was also the time, the industry was awakening to the fact that the primary requirement to make a good film is to have a good script. And this film reinforced that belief once again. It is a triumph of Karthik as a writer. This film also became a calling card for Vijay Sethupathi.\n\nYou can watch this film on Sun NXT.\n\n1. Jigarthanda:\n\nBobby Simhaa in Jigarthanda. Bobby Simhaa in Jigarthanda.\n\nThis is the film that announced the arrival of Karthik Subbaraj in the Tamil film industry. It showed that he was not a one-time wonder and was here to stay. The film follows the efforts of an aspiring filmmaker Karthik Subramani, who spies on a dangerous criminal \u201cAssault\u201d Sethu, as part of the research for his mob movie. What happens when Karthik is caught spying while Sethu was committing a double murder? Drama. This film is a compelling instance of the power of art in bringing a change in people.\n\nYou can watch this film on Disney plus Hotstar."},

This will only supplement what is available in the country because what is now available is not sufficient,\u201d Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the House.\n\nResponding to the opposition\u2019s criticism against the amendment, Sitharaman said the law has \u201cenough safeguards\u201d built in.\n\n\u201cUnder the new structure, the majority of directors on the board and key management persons would have to be resident Indians, which will make them accountable under the Indian law.

(Frederic J. Brown/Pool via AP)\n\nTop US and Chinese officials offered sharply different views of each other and the world on Thursday as the two sides met face-to-face for the first time since President Joe Biden took office.\n\nIn unusually pointed remarks for a staid diplomatic meeting, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese Communist Party foreign affairs chief Yang Jiechi took aim at each other\u2019s country\u2019s policies at the start of two days of talks in Alaska. The contentious tone of their public comments suggested the private discussions would be even more rocky.\n\nThe meetings in Anchorage were a new test in increasingly troubled relations between the two countries, which are at odds over a range of issues from trade to human rights in Tibet, Hong Kong and China\u2019s western Xinjiang region, as well as over Taiwan, China\u2019s assertiveness in the South China Sea and the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBlinken said the Biden administration is united with its allies in pushing back against China\u2019s increasing authoritarianism and assertiveness at home and abroad.\n\nYang then unloaded a list of Chinese complaints about the US and accused Washington of hypocrisy for criticising Beijing on human rights and other issues.\n\n\u201cEach of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability,\u201d Blinken said of China\u2019s actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and of cyber attacks on the United States and economic coercion against US allies. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re not merely internal matters, and why we feel an obligation to raise these issues here today.\u201d\n\nYang responded by demanding the US stop pushing its own version of democracy at a time when the United States itself has been roiled by domestic discontent. He also accused the US of failing to deal with its own human rights problems and took issue with what he said was \u201ccondescension\u201d from Blinken, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and other US officials.\n\n\u201cWe believe that it is important for the United States to change its own image and to stop advancing its own democracy in the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people within the United States actually have little confidence in the democracy of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina will not accept unwarranted accusations from the US side,\u201d he said, adding that recent developments had plunged relations \u201cinto a period of unprecedented difficulty\u201d that \u201chas damaged the interests of our two peoples.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no way to strangle China,\u201d he said.\n\nBlinken seemed taken aback by the tenor and length of the comments, which went on for more than 10 minutes. He said his impressions from speaking with world leaders and on his just-concluded trip to Japan and South Korea were entirely different from the Chinese position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing deep satisfaction that the United States is back, that we\u2019re reengaged,\u201d Blinken retorted. \u201cI\u2019m also hearing deep concern about some of the actions your government is taking.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | As Biden and Xi begin a careful dance, a new American policy takes shape\n\nUnderscoring the animosity, the State Department blasted the Chinese delegation for violating an agreed upon two-minute time limit for opening statements and suggested it \u201cseem(ed) to have arrived intent on grandstanding, focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s approach will be undergirded by confidence in our dealing with Beijing, which we are doing from a position of strength, even as we have the humility to know that we are a country eternally striving to become a more perfect union,\u201d it said.\n\nUS-China ties have been torn for years, and the Biden administration has yet to signal whether it\u2019s ready or willing to back away from the hard-line stances taken under Donald Trump.\n\nJust a day before the meeting, Blinken had announced new sanctions over Beijing\u2019s crackdown on pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong. In response, China stepped up its rhetoric opposing US interference in domestic affairs and complained directly about it.\n\n\u201cIs this a decision made by the United States to try to gain some advantage in dealing with China?\u201d Yang asked. \u201cCertainly, this is miscalculated and only reflects the vulnerability and weakness inside the United States and it will not shake China\u2019s position or resolve on those issues.\u201d\n\nTrump had taken pride in forging what he saw as a strong relationship with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. But the relationship disintegrated after the coronavirus pandemic spread from the Wuhan province across the globe and unleashed a public health and economic disaster."},

(Express File/Abhinav Saha)\n\nObserving that it is for the people and the Government of India to determine the path forward on its recently enacted farm laws, two top Democratic senators have urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to raise the issue of treatment of peaceful farmer protesters and journalists.\n\nIn a letter to Blinken, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday urged the Biden administration to further engage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government over its treatment of farmers in India who have been peacefully demonstrating against the passage of new farm laws.\n\n\u201cIndia is a long-term strategic partner with deep ties to the United States thanks to our many shared values and our large and valued Indian American community. In light of these shared values and strong connections, we write with serious concern regarding the response of the Indian government to the farmer protests,\u201d Menendez and Schumer wrote in their joint letter to Blinken.\n\nIn their letter, released to the press, the two senators urged Blinken to raise the importance of freedom of speech and the right to peaceful protest in conversations with his Indian counterparts and to ensure that State Department officials at all levels do so as well.\n\nAfter becoming the Secretary of State, Blinken has spoken with External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar multiple times. The readouts of the phone calls do not indicate that Blinken raised this issue, under pressure from his party men, with Jaishankar. The Biden administration has insisted that the two countries share democratic values.\n\nSchumer and Menendez said the months-long demonstrations have been met with orders from the central government and local authorities to shut off internet access in protest areas, cut off water and electricity supplies for the tens of thousands living in protest camps, and impede the work of journalists reporting on the protests.\n\n\u201cIndia\u2019s people and government will determine the path forward on these laws, and peaceful dialogue and respect for the viewpoints of all peaceful actors should drive that decision.

This is the first in-person meriting that the Biden administration is having with the Chinese leadership.\n\nIn the past, both Schumer and Menendez have spoken about the important role that India has in their China policy. They have both called for a strong relationship with India. Both have been sponsors of some key legislations in this regard. Prominent among them include, Democracy Technology Partnership Act which says that the world\u2019s major liberal-democratic nations must work together in a technology partnership to ensure that these technologies advance democratic institutions, norms, and values, contributing to global peace and prosperity.\n\nThe Democracy Technology Partnership Act establishes an inter-agency office at the US Department of State to lead in the creation of a new partnership among the world\u2019s tech-leading democracies.\n\nIn their letter, Menendez and Schumer said following the passage of new farm laws last fall, the farmers have engaged in over 100 days of peaceful demonstrations to express their opposition to certain policies.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not take a position on internal Indian policy matters, we recognize and condemn that on January 26, a small faction of protesters engaged in unacceptable violence at the Red Fort in New Delhi, but protest leaders quickly condemned the violence and the vast majority of protesters remained peaceful.\n\nHowever, Indian authorities at different levels of government have used that day\u2019s events as a pretext to undertake a broader and sustained crackdown on peaceful protesters, journalists, and government critics,\u201d they wrote.\n\nNoting that they are alarmed by the sedition charges against a leading opposition politician and a 22-year-old climate activist related to the protests, the two senators said that the central government has repeatedly ordered Twitter to shut down accounts that relate to or report on the protests, including those of media organisations and journalists, and threatened to arrest Indian Twitter employees if the microblogging site fails to comply, as reported by CNN.\n\n\u201cAt the same time, Indian authorities have also sought to hinder the work of journalists reporting on the protests. Indian authorities have filed criminal complaints against at least 10 journalists for their reporting on the protests, including charges of sedition. Reporters without Borders said the accusations represent ?a headlong assault on press freedom,? and Indian press freedom groups have characterized them as an intimidation tactic to stifle the media,\u201d they wrote."},

The graph rose slowly between October 2020 and January 2021, but has again seen an upward trajectory from January-end onwards.\n\nThe rise\n\nThe cause for concern is the increasing number of cases in March \u2014 23,242 cases were reported between March 1 and March 18 \u2014 with 372 deaths during the same period, while in all of February, 8,900 new cases had been reported alongwith 217 deaths. In January, 6,754 new cases had been added to the case tally, with 274 new deaths.\n\nOn March 18 itself, a total of 2,387 cases were reported with 32 deaths. This took the total state tally to 2,05,418 and overall toll to 6,204. The case fatality rate (CFR) of the state stands at 3.02 per cent, which is highest in the country.\n\nA study of case counts every month-end shows that on March 31 last year, 41 cases were recorded, of which 4 patients died, and thus CFR was high at 9.75 per cent. The first Covid death was recorded in Punjab on March 19 last year, a Nawashahr-based senior citizen who had returned from Italy. The number of patients grew to 480 by April 30 in Punjab, with deaths increasing to 10. With this, the CFR reduced to 2.08 per cent. By May 31, this number grew to 2,263 with 45 deaths, though CFR had fallen to 1.98 per centby May 31 although number of deaths had grown by 350 per cent from April 30 to May 31.\n\nWith 1,783 new cases testing positive in a month, this percentage increase was 371.4 per cent. From April-end till the first week of May, Punjab residents stuck in Nanded and different parts of Rajasthan had come back. A number of them had tested positive. The number of patients by June 30 had increased to 5,568 and the number of deaths too increased to 144 with CFR again rising to 2.5 per cent while 3,305 new cases including 99 deaths had been reported from May 31 to June 30.\n\nA surge in cases started from June-end onwards. Cases by July-end increased to 16,119, with 10,551 new cases and 242 new deaths being recorded between June 30 and July 31. The numbers rose further when the figures by August 31 were 53,992 patients and 1,453 deaths. The CFR was 2.69 per cent at the time. In this period (July 31 \u2013 August 31), 37,873 new cases including 1,067 Covid deaths had been reported.\n\nBy August end, level 3 beds in ICUs were full to capacity in Ludhiana while in many other districts, there were only a few beds left. A number of patients had to struggle hard to get beds in September first week when finally, more private hospitals were added to the list of providing critical care to sick patients. The gaps in medical facilities were highlighted when Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu himself had admitted that most civil hospitals did not have ICU facilities in Punjab and hence for critical care, they were largely dependent on private medical colleges and hospitals and three government colleges of Punjab.\n\nBy September 30, the cases had grown to 1,13,886 with total deaths at 3,406, CFR was 2.99 per cent at that time. The maximum cases were added between August 31 and September 30 time \u2014 59,894 with 1,953 deaths.\n\nThe dip\n\nThe cases started decreasing after that. Only 19,772 new cases including 797 deaths were reported between September 30 and October 31. The percentage increase of cases, which was 110.9 per cent between August 31 and September 30, fell to only 17.3 per cent between September 30 and October 31. While percentage increase in deaths was 134.4 per cent between August 31 and September 30, it fell sharply to only 23.39 per cent from September 30 to October 31. However, high CFR was a problem which increased to 3.14 per cent by October 31, last year.\n\nFurthermore, between October 31 and November 30, 18,433 new cases were added with 604 deaths. Between November 30 and December 31, 14,431 new cases were added with 534 deaths. Another 6,754 new cases were added between December 31 and January 31 with 274 deaths. The overall Covid count became 1,73,276 with deaths at 5,615 by January 31.\n\n\n\nThe second wave\n\nHowever, in the next 28 days, a total of 8,900 new cases were reported with 217 deaths, thus taking the total number of cases and deaths to 1,82,176 and 5,832 respectively by February 28.\n\nThe situation became alarming in March, when in 18 days (till March 18), 23,260 new cases were reported with 372 deaths."},

(Photo: Karan Singh Grover/Instagram)\n\nKaran Singh Grover is overwhelmed with the audience love he is getting for going back to playing the fan favourite character of Asad Ahmed Khan in his latest web series \u2013 Qubool Hai 2.0. The television show, which first aired in 2012, got a sequel which is currently streaming on ZEE5.\n\nIn an Instagram live session with indianexpress.com, KSG got candid about the audience reaction on seeing him reprising his character in a completely new set-up and world, quality he\u2019d like to inculcate from wife Bipasha Basu, and his painting exhibition that got postponed due to the lockdown in 2020.\n\nHere are excerpts from the interaction:\n\nHow has the audience been to Qubool Hai 2.0?\n\nFans don\u2019t shy away from showing their love. Qubool Hai 2.0 got appreciated by so many people. You don\u2019t realise that sometimes, you put in so much of you in a project because you love it so much. And then getting the same love from the people watching it, is heavenly.\n\nI\u2019m not a good actor. I have to actually become the character. And Asad is somebody I\u2019ve worked really hard on. He\u2019s at opposite end of the spectrum. So when I did it for more than a year (in TV show), he stayed with me. As soon as I got to know about Qubool Hai 2.0, Asad was out, and said \u201cokay you (Karan) sit now, I\u2019ll take care.\u201d Asad has evolved, because the audience themselves have evolved. We\u2019re all kind of growing and evolving together.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by karan singh grover (@iamksgofficial)\n\nWhat\u2019s been the best compliment you received for the show?\n\nSomebody told me that they loved my micro expressions. Asad has layers. So, if somebody\u2019s catching that, it\u2019s good. Whenever I do any character, they break it down because they know I broke it down. I do it because it\u2019s my job. But if they do it, it means they put a lot of effort and attention into it.\n\nYou play an action avatar, a shooter\u2019s role. Did your aim improve post the show?\n\nI remember in school, I played Arjun on stage. That time my aim was not very good at all, because the arrow went far away. But for Qubool Hai, somehow the training was meditative because every movement is related to breath. So, you have to be very careful when you\u2019re breathing and your stance. I realised even though we think we\u2019re still, we\u2019re actually moving. The time between the inhalation and exhalation, that\u2019s the time to aim.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by Indian Express Entertainment (@ieentertainment)\n\nAlso read | Qubool Hai 2.0: Surbhi Jyoti reveals one thing that has changed in Karan Singh Grover in last 8 years\n\nWhat\u2019s you favourite scene from Qubool Hai 2.0?\n\nThe one in the car, where I come out of it and shoot, and also the Asad and Zoya meeting.\n\nWhat was Bipasha\u2019s reaction to the show?\n\nShe said it\u2019s good, you\u2019re good. It\u2019s looking good and it\u2019s been shot well.\n\nDo you guys talk work at home? Or does Bipasha give you any work related advice?\n\nWe do talk about work. Everyone should have somebody like her in their lives. We all have filters, so that we don\u2019t really say something that would hurt the other person. She doesn\u2019t have that. She will just say it the way it is. It\u2019s very important because it gives you a reality check. There\u2019s no criticising her work because she\u2019s excellent at it. I take a lot of advice for her. I\u2019m lucky like that.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by bipashabasusinghgrover (@bipashabasu)\n\nWhat\u2019s that one quality you\u2019d like to inculcate from Bipasha?\n\nThe way she always thinks of everyone and is aware of everyone and sends enough love to everyone all the time and does everything for everyone. It\u2019s unfathomable.\n\nYou\u2019ve been experimenting with your roles off late, be it grey shades in Hate Story 3 or Mr Bajaj in Kasautii Zindagii Kay. Is it difficult to do all of it almost at the same time?\n\nIf I\u2019m playing two characters at the same time, it gets a little tricky. This happened to me when I was doing Kasautii and Boss at the same time. Both are very different characters. So I remember the director of Kasautii would shout \u201cBajaj\u201d if I was not being into the zone. Then, when I went to shoot the promo of Boss, I kept getting distracted into being Bajaj. Then you also have to be yourself in the middle. So, that got mixed up. It\u2019s difficult.\n\nWhat do you remember of the first time you faced the camera?\n\nI used to be, and sometime I still am, very cocky. And I like making fun of people. That\u2019s what I was doing before my first shot, and then my shot came. I took 27 takes to do it. I got abused by my creative director. She said I kept making fun of everyone, and now what was I doing. I couldn\u2019t even say Mumbai. I said Bumba every time.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by karan singh grover (@iamksgofficial)\n\nYour much awaited painting exhibition got postponed because of the lockdown last year. When do we get to see the artistic side of you?\n\nI was supposed to have my exhibition last March, but because of the world closing down, we couldn\u2019t do it. But I guess the good thing that happened was there\u2019s an international gallery that signed to represent me. During the lockdown I made 15-16 new pieces. Maybe I\u2019ll have the exhibition in September now. This might be an online thing. The website is starinfinityart.com.\n\nLastly, if Dill Mill Gayye is remade or revived, would you like to return as Dr Armaan Malik?\n\nIs that even a question? You think they will dare have Dill Mill Gayye without me? You think I wouldn\u2019t beat them up at home. No, I\u2019m joking (laughs)."},

We have dedicated these four years to tackling infinite challenges, exploring endless possibilities and realising your dreams. On March 19, 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave us the path of \u201cSabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas\u201d. As the state government completes four years, I am satisfied that we have been successful in implementing our policies in line with this goal.\n\nPM Modi has dreamt of a \u201cself-reliant India\u201d to overcome the economic crisis unleashed by the COVID pandemic. He is pursuing the goal of making the country a $-5 trillion economy. UP is committed to making a significant contribution towards this goal. Studies reveal that UP is the state with the greatest possibilities in terms of demographic dividend. The only thing needed was to explore and realise these possibilities through coordinated policies and clear intentions.\n\nThe government identified barriers to industrial capital investments and facilitated investment procedures by introducing a single-window system. We took concrete steps to provide world-class connectivity and brought the government\u2019s plans and other benefits to the last person in the queue. It was not an easy task to rise to number two in the national ranking of \u201cEase of Doing Business\u201d within four years, but we did it. UP has become the best business and investment destination in India and ranks second in terms of economy, playing the role of the growth engine for the country. The story of Bundelkhand women working tirelessly to achieve a profit of Rs 2 crore in milk production with a total annual turnover of Rs 46 crore is inspiring. In the COVID period alone, as many as 67,000 members of self-help groups stitched over one crore school uniforms for children of council schools, earning more than Rs 100 crore. Many such innovative efforts are becoming the cornerstone of realising the dream of \u201cSelf-reliant Uttar Pradesh\u201d.\n\nMoving forward on the path of development, 40 lakh families got housing and 1.38 crore families got electricity connection in just four years in UP, while the connectivity of every village has improved significantly and work is going on a war-footing to lay optical fibre in the countryside.\n\nWe have strengthened interstate connectivity. Five expressways are getting ready to accelerate development, and defence corridors are being built to make the country self-sufficient in defence production. We have to remember that this is the same UP where the per capita income in 2015-16 was just Rs 47,116. Today, it is Rs 94,495. The state with a GDP of Rs 10.90 lakh crore in 2015-16 has emerged with a GDP of Rs 21.73 lakh crore today. This is change.\n\nUnder the Jal Jeevan Mission, work is underway to ensure the availability of safe tap water to every household across the state. The state government is working on a comprehensive action plan in this context in Bundelkhand, the Vindhya region and 30,000 revenue villages. The piped drinking water scheme is also being implemented in all these villages. We are thankful to the PM for making the necessary arrangements in the Union Budget to connect villages and cities under JJM. The UP government is providing the benefits of schemes to all without any discrimination. There has been unprecedented development in Musahar, Tharu and Vantangia villages. In eastern UP, Japanese encephalitis and AES disease, which have been the cause of the untimely ageing of innocent children for three decades, have almost been eliminated.\n\nThe pandemic and its aftermath held many learning experiences. The suffering of students and their parents who went to other states to prepare for competitive examinations was one, especially during the lockdown period. This set us thinking: Why, despite being the largest state in the country, can\u2019t we prevent our meritorious students from fleeing the state? We decided to find a permanent solution to this problem and came up with the Mukhyamantri Abhyudaya Yojana. The Yojana seeks to provide preparation opportunities for competitive exams to the youth by engaging excellent teachers, subject matter experts and administrative officers to hold classes. Until now, these youths were either deprived of guidance due to a lack of money or they had to go to places like Kota and Delhi. Many youths, whose parents were poor, either could not afford to get coaching in good institutions or their parents had to sell their property. These conditions put psychological pressure on the youth. It gives me spiritual satisfaction that this scheme has been accepted wholeheartedly by students and their parents.\n\nToday\u2019s era is not about youngsters becoming \u201cjob seekers\u201d, but \u201cjob generators\u201d. Under the Mukhyamantri Yuva Swarozgar Yojana, the UP government is providing financial assistance up to Rs 25 lakh to provide self-employment for the youth. These efforts have proved their utility.\n\nWe embarked on our public welfare journey four years ago with waiving farmers\u2019 loans. The state government did not hold its first cabinet meeting until the action plan for loan waiver for small and marginal farmers was prepared. Today, farmers in the state are progressing with the support of advanced technology and are moving towards agricultural diversification.\n\nThe last four years have witnessed the creation of New India\u2019s New UP. Our political rivals also recognise that in the last four years, there has not been a single scheme that differentiates among people based on caste or religion. Yes, we are not following the policy of appeasement. Farmers, youth, women and the poor are at the centre of our policies. The policies and the intention of the government are crystal clear and that is why the people are with the government. The state is the same, the resources are the same, the workmen are also the same, but the work culture has changed. This transparent work culture with a dedicated and committed workforce is the hallmark of this brand new Uttar Pradesh. May Maa Bharti guide us in our noble pursuit.\n\nThe writer is chief minister of Uttar Pradesh."},

The CB-CID had registered an FIR against the former Special DGP over sexual harassment allegations, levelled by a subordinate woman IPS officer.\n\nThe Election Commission had earlier ordered the suspension of a then Superintendent of Police, whose name also figures in the FIR.

The ruling came on a plea by Advocate Aparna Bhat and eight other women lawyers against the high court order.\n\n\n\nWriting for the bench, Justice Bhat reminded that \u201cthe role of all courts is to make sure that the survivor can rely on their impartiality and neutrality, at every stage in a criminal proceeding, where she is the survivor and an aggrieved party\u201d and that \u201ceven an indirect undermining of this responsibility cast upon the court\u2026 could in many cases, shake the confidence of the rape survivor (or accuser of the crime) in the impartiality of the court\u201d.\n\nThe \u201cbail conditions and orders\u2026 must strictly be in accordance with the requirements of the Cr. PC\u201d, the bench said. \u201cIn other words, discussion about the dress, behavior, or past \u2018conduct\u2019 or \u2018morals\u2019 of the prosecutrix, should not enter the verdict granting bail.\u201d The conditions should also \u201cnot mandate, require or permit\u201d contact between the accused and the victim, it said.\n\nAsking judges to show sensitivity in their orders, the court said even a single instance of an order to the contrary \u201creflects adversely on the entire judicial system of the country, undermining the guarantee to fair justice to all, and especially to victims of sexual violence\u201d.\n\nIt asked courts to \u201cdesist from expressing any stereotype opinion\u2026 to the effect that\u2026 women are physically weak and need protection\u2026 are incapable of or cannot take decisions on their own\u2026 men are the \u2018head\u2019 of the household and should take all the decisions relating to family\u2026 women should be submissive and obedient according to our culture\u2026 \u2018good\u2019 women are sexually chaste\u2026 a woman consuming alcohol, smoking, etc. may justify unwelcome advances by men or \u2018has asked for it\u2019\u2026\u201d\n\nTaking a grim view of the high court order, the bench said \u201cusing rakhi tying as a condition for bail transforms a molester into a brother by a judicial mandate. This is wholly unacceptable, and has the effect of diluting and eroding the offence of sexual harassment. The act perpetrated on the survivor constitutes an offence in law, and is not a minor transgression that can be remedied by way of an apology, rendering community service, tying a rakhi or presenting a gift to the survivor, or even promising to marry her, as the case may be\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe law criminalises outraging the modesty of a woman. Granting bail, subject to such conditions, renders the court susceptible to the charge of re-negotiating and mediating justice between confronting parties in a criminal offence and perpetuating gender stereotypes,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cGender violence is most often unseen and is shrouded in a culture of silence,\u201d the bench said, adding \u201cthis silence needs to be broken\u201d and that \u201cin doing so, men, perhaps more than women, have a duty and role to play in averting and combating violence against women\u201d.\n\nThe court also called for introducing programmes for gender sensitisation of judges and law students."},

Uttar Pradesh was the first state to bring a Bill for recovery from the people for damages caused to public property during agitation and protests.\n\nWith Haryana facing intense farmers\u2019 agitation and the BJP-JJP leaders being boycotted by the protesters making their public meetings almost impossible, the Congress questioned the timing of the Bill. However, Khattar and Home Minister Anil Vij rejected the Congress accusation.\n\nVij said the Bill was meant to hold accountable those who burn shops and damage other public and private property during protests. \u201cWe are not bringing this Bill against people\u2019s democratic right to hold a protest, \u201c he said, adding, \u201cthe actual perpetrators of such acts of violence and crimes as also the instigators, organisers be made liable for damages to public and private property and the cost of the forces requisitioned from outside the state for controlling such acts of violence and crimes\u201d.\n\nBut senior Congress leader R S Kadian claimed that the Bill infringed upon fundamental rights. \u201cWhat was the need for such a Bill? This Bill has been brought at a time when farmers are sitting on protest,\u201d he said. He objected to the word \u201cinstigator\u201d used in the Bill. \u201cIt is a vindictive piece of legislation,\u201d he said.\n\nVij also claimed that Bill was not linked to the ongoing farmers\u2019 agitation. \u201cDuring past 110 days (of agitation), the farmers have not even broken a leaf,\u201d said Vij. \u201cWe did not stop the agitators from observing the hunger strike, blocking roads and trains,\u201d he added. He repeatedly asked opposition members to decide whether they supported those who cause damage to property and resort to violent means or if they are with those who believe in holding peaceful protests.\n\nReferring to provisions in the Bill, Kadian charged, \u201cThis bill is aimed at dividing the state and its people, a scare is being created. The way this Bill has been introduced, it raises many doubts\u2026Those who participated in the freedom struggle had dreamed of a society without fear. But this (Bill) comes in the category of infringement of fundamental rights.\u201d\n\nHe said the Bill should be withheld and referred to a select committee of the House.\n\nIndependent MLA Sombir Sangwan, who had earlier withdrawn support to the Khattar government over the farmers\u2019 issue, said the government was mistaken if it felt the farmers\u2019 stir will end due to \u201cfear\u201d over the proposed law. \u201cThere is every possibility of misuse of this law,\u201d said Sangwan.\n\nWhile the government asserted that there was no connection between the two, Congress leader Kiran Choudhary said the \u201cperception\u201d is important. She alleged that the Bill contained \u201cdraconian provisions\u201d and was being brought to suppress farmers.\n\nLater, addressing media outside the House Khattar said that the 2.5 crore people of Haryana have every right over their land and it is the responsibility of the state government to protect it. For this purpose, the Bill was passed by the Vidhan Sabha. \u201cIt is necessary to instill fear in the minds of those who damage property and this is our constitutional legal system,\u201d said Khattar, adding that this law should have been framed long ago.\n\nHe said that in a democracy everyone has the right to speak and protest peacefully, but no one has the right to damage property.\n\nFormer chief minister Hooda, however,claimed that the \u201cpurpose and reasons of the proposed law\u201d have \u201cclearly written that the government wants to instil a sense of fear\u201d among the common man. \u201cSection-14 of the Bill states that the recovery will not only be made from those who indulge in violence but also from those who want to lead the protest, the organizers, those involved in its planning, those who provide encouragement and the participants. The government will take action by placing every protesting person in the category of guilty,\u201d he said.\n\nThe government, he said, has also violated the directions given by the Supreme Court in 2009 that innocent people should not be harassed in cases of recovery from those indulging in violence and they may even be leading the protest. \u201cThe court also recommended protection to those who took part in the agitation peacefully but the government has clearly overlooked the provisions,\u201d he said, adding that the proposed legislation \u201cdoes not fix any responsibility or accountability on the government and police\u201d.\n\n\u201cDuring the debate, Home Minister admitted that there was no violence during the farmer\u2019s movement against three farm laws. If he believes so, then why is the government continuously filing cases against innocent farmers. The government should withdraw all the cases,\u201d Hooda demanded."},

His wife has moved the court seeking exhumation and repatriation of the body.\n\nListing the case for March 24 for further monitoring, Justice Prathiba M Singh also said that a timeline should be obtained and communicated to the MEA.\n\nThe ministry had earlier told the court that they have written to the authorities in Saudi Arabia for exhumation of the body but a timeline cannot be provided as they are yet to get any response.\n\nAccording to the petition filed by Anju Sharma, wife of Sanjeev Kumar, who had been working as a truck driver in Saudi Arabia for the past 23 years and died in January due to cardiac arrest, the body was kept in a hospital in Jizan and she was to complete formalities for repatriation. She completed the formalities on January 28 but was told on February 18 that the body has been buried due to a mistake in the translation of death certificate which identified his religion as \u201cMuslim\u201d.\n\nHowever, MEA\u2019s Director of Consular Passport, Visa Division, Vishnu Sharma, on Thursday told the court that the translation of the death certificate was done by Kumar\u2019s employer but it is inconsequential as the authorities in Saudi Arabia were aware about his religion since Kumar was not buried in a Muslim cemetery. Sharma also said the Indian Consulate is usually informed about the death of an Indian citizen and a body is not buried unless an NOC is issued, but this time there was no such communication perhaps due to Covid-19 protocol.\n\nThe court was also told that the employer, Salem Abdullah Saad Al-Saqar, has deposited some compensation for the family of the deceased in the Indian Consulate Jeddah\u2019s bank account and the cheque has been couriered to the district collector in Una, Himachal Pradesh, where Kumar\u2019s family resides.

{"source": "ie", "headline": "How Covid shackled older women", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/coronavirus-impact-on-old-people-health-schemes-7234767/", "content": "In a pandemic situation, in addition to being more vulnerable to medical problems, older adults also face the emotional and social backlash of social isolation, loneliness, feeling of susceptibility, heightened dependence and restricted autonomy and freedom. Add to that are challenges in using technology, grief, loss and financial constraints and you have a recipe for increased psychological problems. Many elders also worry about the uncertainty of being hospitalised alone or, worse still, dying alone in the absence of loved ones. One would have, therefore, expected higher rates of psychiatric problems, especially among older women. However, limited available data, at least from the West, shows that the older adults actually cope better and have lower rates of mental health problems. The possible reasons are higher mental resilience, positivity, and the inherent wisdom acquired with age and experience.\n\nHowever, data on stress among elders from most low-and-middle income countries (LMIC) during COVID-19 are unavailable. The voices of elders are also absent in policies as they are usually not represented in any decision or policymaking body. A simple policy such as protected hours during shopping in grocery stores used in the West, could not be found in any city in India.\n\nWomen elders in India have always found their own ways of social connections and engagement. Meeting their grandchildren, children and peer groups provide them with a sense of identity, security and support. The pandemic and its consequent precautions have restricted these day-to-day sources of joy. Moreover, limiting the movements and activities of our aged parents and grandparents with the best intentions of protecting them, has been often done without providing alternatives. The norms that dictated and restricted them all their lives as women got a renewed impetus during COVID-19. Those in care-homes have also faced an increased risk of loneliness, known to be an independent predictor of depression in the elderly.\n\nCultural influences on older women are also of paramount importance. In the Indian socio-cultural milieu, wives who are often younger than their spouses serve as their main caregivers in the older age. The pandemic has grossly restricted domestic help and paid caregivers due to safety concerns, which made the elder women the sole carers of their elderly husbands. Their own safety and psychological concerns might not have been catered to. For some, it all just became a habit over time, with indifference forming the mainstay of coping. In the words of an elder woman, \u201cMy children are abroad, my husband is ill, my house help can\u2019t enter the home, I cannot go out and I am not as `smart\u2019 as my smartphone. So practically I am physically, socially and emotionally distanced in all ways!\u201d. Another pointed out the permanence of social isolation and confinement, \u201cEven earlier, with the traffic, pollution and my husband\u2019s health, social distancing was already the norm. So COVID-19 didn\u2019t make much of a difference except I did not have help at home!\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organisation defines elder abuse as a single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person. While there has been an overall increase in domestic violence, the extent of elder abuse, particularly towards older women is largely invisible.\n\nThough the pandemic has digitalised lives and living, it is not prudent to expect many of our senior citizens to handle virtual meets and online platforms for staying connected, without any training. Also, a video call cannot be a substitute for a hug, a handshake, a pat or a kiss, each of which convey the affectionate touch that is so important for older adults. The digital divide in ownership of gadgets, poor access to technology in rural areas and gender inequality of digital literacy have further isolated older women from social connections. This might be another possible reason, why in spite of the boom in tele-healthcare, it has been utilised by senior citizens only to a limited extent.\n\nContrary to many popular taglines, the pandemic has not been a \u201cgreat equaliser\u201d. Age and gender have been a major factor. Age brings in frailty, issues with memory, vision, hearing and thinking process, all of which together with skill-deficits may interfere with online participation in studies and surveys contributing to their voices remaining \u201cunheard\u201d. It will be a collective responsibility to counter both ageism and sexism to prevent isolation in any such future situation. The media and the administration both have a leading role to play. This is not to say that the elderly women are weak, but they do have unique vulnerabilities. With adequate support and understanding, they can not only withstand stress but also gift us with important life lessons to learn.\n\nTheir psychological wellbeing, social support, education, autonomy and independence need inclusive attitudes from all of us. These strategies need to be an integral part of public health measures and disaster preparedness during any future outbreak. Valuing their contributions, improving digital literacy, early identification of mental health problems, and avoiding negative risk-biased communication can further bolster their resilience. Prevention of elder abuse, encouraging prompt detection and reporting, integrating helplines for older adults and finally home-delivery of essential commodities, including daily amenities (like grocery, medicines, etc.) are the need of the hour. Research-driven policies need to be tailored based on their voices as well.\n\nThis article first appeared in the print edition on March 19, 2021 under the title \u2018Covid and an invisible crisis\u2019.

I have defended it for the legal correctness of its arguments and the greater cause it serves of national reconciliation. Amongst the arguments I marshalled in support was the explicit finding that the Places of Worship Act conclusively put a lid on all other disputes by freezing the status of places of worship on 15 August 1947. Five justices of the Constitution Bench stamped their approval on the far-sighted Act passed in the aftermath of the December 6, 1992 demolition of Babri Masjid. Understandably, the validity of the Act was not under challenge and the Court did not expressly hear arguments on either side but the fact remains that the Constitution Bench stamped its approval. Technically speaking, the notice issued by the Supreme Court might be correct, but the implications are far-reaching and might undermine our efforts to persuade the general public, including Muslims, about the correctness and virtue of the Ayodhya judgment. Inevitably the sceptics who opposed the acceptance of the alternative piece of land for a mosque will steal a march over those of us who support reconciliation. What is worse the country will once again descend into the spiral of conflict and lack of faith, not something that any god would want to inflict upon us.\n\nThe path opened by the latest notice is wide and endless; Mathura and Varanasi will not be the final destination. Filial piety will entirely be replaced by paying for the \u201csins\u201d of ancestors. For all of us who have condemned Partition and accepted that the national unity of India of 1947 is more important than imagined insecurity or perceived slight to dignity, we are suddenly being subjected to a new Partition. But having repudiated it once, we will reject it with greater emphasis this time. It matters not that a further price has to be paid. We will pay the price without the least hesitation. Yet a question must be asked: Do people who are pushing India away from acceptance of pluralism know where it will lead us? Modern-day liberal societies are for reasons of principle or pragmatics fast becoming multi-ethnic and multi-cultural. Our own contribution to the changing colours and contours of global societies is considerable. We celebrate Indian-Americans reaching out to place their footprints on the soil of US politics. Questioning, if not stifling, pluralism at home can only be signs of myopia or at worse, hypocrisy. We have expressed outrage at racism in the UK targeting the first Indian woman President of the Oxford Union accused of insensitive racial tweets. But our government pretends not to hear similar, and worse, slurs and insults directed at our own people. Protest and patriotism have become the two boxes to tick on the peril of social media onslaughts and police prosecutions. Yet we are aggrieved that other democracies in the world find that disturbing.\n\nIndia is engaged in a battle for the mind and soul. We would like to believe that we speak for the light against the darkness espoused by our adversaries. Be that as it may, the battle, not of our seeking, will be a long and arduous one. Yet we will prevail in the end because the soul of India will not be suppressed for long. But sadly we remain scattered in our separate ambitions to become victors against oppression and deceit. The truth is that what matters is we vanquish the forces that have sought to destroy the India we cherish, and not who wears the laurel leaf of triumph and acclaim. The rules of recognition will emerge organically from the struggle itself. Legacy and ambition will have to take the back seat as we equip ourselves for a battle with an adversary who has changed the rules of engagement and turned hate and avarice into lethal weapons.\n\nIn all historic battles, the experienced and youth march shoulder to shoulder to accomplish the toughest of tasks. Unfortunately, our times have seen the unwholesome estrangement of the young from the old. The impatience and frustration felt by the former and the insensitivity shown by the latter have brought us a wide gap. A remarkable popular protest against NRC-CAA was marred by speeches and actions by young activists that provided fuel to the detractors. Freedom belongs to us all and cannot be a monopoly of some. Freedom and its claim come with corresponding responsibilities. Short cuts might appear attractive and even heroic but if they hurt the idea of Freedom, they are no less oppressive than the very acts being opposed. Those who defend Freedom must be morally superior to those who desecrate it. Mahatma Gandhi must be our constant pole star in the process.\n\nEven as we balance ourselves to steady the ship of State, we cannot and must not steer away from the Supreme Court. Despite periodic disappointments and some signs of accommodation of majoritarian perceptions, the Supreme Court is what stands between the rule of law and the rule of whims. Like other members of society, judges too are a product of and respond to circumstances. They are trained to appeal to higher values of our society that we lesser people overlook for selfish concerns. It is for that reason we place constitutional faith in our judges.\n\nThis article first appeared in the print edition on March 19, 2021 under the title \u2018Don\u2019t reopen old wounds\u2019.

{"source": "ie", "headline": "Lateral Entry: A challenging administrative reform", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-ias-administrative-reforms-7234834/", "content": "The lack of administrative reform in India has frustrated many stakeholders for a long time. Occasionally, it finds a voice at the highest levels, most recently when, during a speech in Parliament, Prime Minister Modi complained about the overreach of the elite IAS cadre. Unsurprisingly, one of the key focus areas of such reform is enabling lateral entry into an otherwise \u201cpermanent\u201d system of administrators. But the success of lateral entry hinges entirely on how it is designed.\n\nThe present government, to its credit, has taken some steps on lateral entry. Eight professionals were recruited for joint secretary-level positions in various ministries. Some other positions at the joint secretary and director-level have been advertised. But this is unlikely to shake up the system which is the entire logic of lateral entry. Here is why.\n\nThe terms on which the positions are advertised may dissuade the best from applying. In the permanent system, IAS officers get promoted to joint secretary level after 17 years of service and remain at that level for ten years. The IAS and permanent system are strictly seniority-bound \u2014 nobody gets promoted ahead of time. That makes the average age of a joint secretary around 45. Now, if similar experience requirements are used for lateral entry, it is unlikely that the best will join because in the private sector they rise to the top of their profession, in CXO positions, or tenured professorships, at that age.\n\nTheir aspiration will be for a higher position. To attract the best talent from outside at the joint secretary level, entry requirements need to be relaxed so that persons of 35 years of age are eligible. The logic extends to other ranks. IAS officers become secretaries to the government after 30 to 33 years of service, which means they are 55 or above. The best talent from outside would only join at 50 or less. If one looks at lateral entry in an earlier generation, among economists, there was much greater flexibility. The likes of Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Bimal Jalan and Vijay Kelkar were joint secretaries in their mid-30s and secretaries by their late 40s or by 50. That is one of the reasons they left lucrative assignments abroad.\n\nThe second challenge is whether the system is facilitating lateral entrants for success or is indifferent to the point of failure. There are many dimensions to this. For a start, there are several joint secretaries in each ministry who handle different portfolios. If assigned to an unimportant portfolio, the chances of not making a mark are high. A cursory look at the portfolios of the eight laterally-hired joint secretaries doesn\u2019t suggest that they hold critical portfolios. One entrant has already quit.\n\nThere must also be clarity in what precisely is the mandate for the lateral entrant. There is a difference in bringing expertise and being part of the decision-making process. For the former, the government doesn\u2019t strictly need to hire \u201coutsiders\u201d. Expertise is widely available and used by almost every ministry \u2014 expert committees, consultations, think tank engagements, etc. To be disrupters, lateral entrants need to be able to stamp their authority on decision making. For this to happen, there need to be more lateral entrants at all levels in ministries. Anyone familiar with the functioning of government knows that there is a long chain in decision-making and a minority of one cannot override it. Also, it requires an understanding of the system and an ability to work with the \u201cpermanent\u201d establishment. No training or orientation is provided for this. By the time networks are built, it is time to move on.\n\nOn past evidence, the lateral entrants who made the biggest impact are those who served in the system for a length of time and at different levels. The economists mentioned earlier joined as advisers at the joint secretary level before moving up the ladder to mainstream positions, learning to work with the permanent establishment in the process. A recent lateral entrant like Parameswaran Iyer succeeded because he had served in the IAS early on.\n\nLateral entry, like competition in any sphere, is a good thing. But serious thinking is required on entry requirements, job assignments, number of personnel and training to make it a force for positive change. Some reform of the \u201cpermanent\u201d system \u2014 particularly its seniority principle \u2014 may be a prerequisite.\n\nThis article first appeared in the print edition on March 19, 2021 under the title \u2018Devil is in the design\u2019.

{"source": "ie", "headline": "How Rajasthan can make its Right to Health promise work", "link": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rajasthan-budget-healthcare-covid-19-7234817/", "content": "In 1947, post-colonial India set off with the ambition of building a modern state on the principles of equality where citizens, by virtue of their birth in the country, would be entitled to a life of dignity. While the Constitution provided the rights to life, liberty, nutritional standards and maternity care, it did not explicitly state health as a fundamental right. Access to good quality healthcare was, and continues to be, a privilege, enjoyed by those fulfilling conditions of wealth, location and social status. This was so despite India being a signatory to the WHO\u2019s Constitution of 1946 which envisaged the ideal of ensuring \u201cthe highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being\u201d by allocating the \u201cmaximum available resources\u201d.\n\nThe discourse on health as a human right was amplified when the HIV/AIDS pandemic led to the creation of global civil society coalitions that pressured governments to make HIV treatment and sexual freedoms fundamental to human rights. In the last decade, the increasing cost of care and consequent impoverishment of those seeking medical treatment added momentum to the debate by demanding universal health coverage (UHC) to build societal resilience to the devastating impacts of ill health.\n\nSince UHC is based on the principle of equality and non-denial of care on grounds of affordability, the two ideas of health as a human right and UHC converged to be translated into state policy for creating a \u201clegal obligation to ensure access to timely, acceptable and affordable healthcare of appropriate quality as well as to providing the underlying determinants of health such as safe potable water\u2026..\u201d resulting in its inclusion in the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) to be realised by 2030.\n\nIndia has not been immune to these global developments. But given the compulsions of addressing multiple development challenges, \u201callocating the maximum available resources\u201d for health has always been a major issue. Public health spending as a percentage of GDP has hovered around an average of 1 per cent against the global average of 8 per cent, constraining the building of a rights-based healthcare system. In 2018, India\u2019s public health spending as a percentage of total health expenditures was 26.95 per cent, against the global average of 59.54 per cent with just 20 countries spending less than India. At 62.67 per cent out-of-pocket expenditure on health, such spending in India was the 13th highest in the world.\n\nIn addition to low public health spending, key barriers to universalising access to healthcare are the inadequate availability of services, particularly in rural areas, a severe shortage of human resources and the rising cost of care due to more intensive use of technologies alongside changing perceptions of quality. So, while low public spending is seen as the root cause, a study of catastrophic health expenditures (10 to 25 per cent of household income) in 133 countries brought out two interesting insights with policy implications \u2014 one, the positive partial correlation between income inequality and catastrophic spending at all income levels and two, absence of evidence that the mere increase in health spending or channeling it through private insurance and non-profit institutions provided financial protection.\n\nSince a decade, concerted attempts have been made by civil society organisations to persuade governments to enact laws making health a human right. The manifestos of the CPM and Congress in 2019, however, are the first instance of a clear political commitment towards promoting such a rights-based policy.\n\nThe COVID pandemic brought to the surface the inadequacies of the health system and the denial of basic care, where even basic public health functions like testing or contact tracing and behaviour change required the whole and exclusive attention of the district administration. Coping with this one infection has not only meant denying care to non-COVID patients but also the inability to treat all as per protocol due to limited infrastructure in public and private sectors, provoking the Rajasthan government to expedite its intention to introduce the Rajasthan Model of Public Health (RMPH) in its budget for 2021-22, embedding in it a public health law making access to health a right.\n\nFor realising this aspiration, Rajasthan has proposed doubling its budget, setting up medical and nursing colleges, establishing and upgrading primary health centres and substantially improving the delivery of services by expanding access to free medicines and diagnostics, besides adding 1,000 beds and establishing institutions of excellence for cardiology, virology, cancer and maternity and childcare. New features to its current health insurance programme are three \u2014 expansion of the eligibility criteria to cover two-thirds of the population, providing 50 per cent subsidy for the non-poor sections to avail of the health insurance programme by providing them cover for Rs 5 lakh worth of cashless treatment in government and accredited private hospitals, and assuring coverage of not just inpatient but also outpatient treatment.\n\nThe intention is laudable. But for achieving the goal of arresting catastrophic expenses, it would be essential to sequence investments over the next decade, starting with ensuring universal access to social determinants and primary healthcare services by focusing on malnutrition and filling gaps in accessing toilets, safe water and basic health services. This would require an uncompromising attention to substantially and expeditiously improving the primary healthcare infrastructure in terms of buildings, human resources and technology. If strict prioritisation is not maintained, much of the scarce resources can get diverted to providing expensive hospital treatment for the not-so-rich but more vocal people in urban areas, widening existing inequities and not reducing catastrophic expenditures.\n\nThe COVID pandemic has deepened poverty and set back the economy by a decade. In such a desperate situation, the state is faced with a paradox of addressing the need for a rights-based policy. This, however, requires doubling of resources that are unavailable, necessitating reviewing interventions so as to remove waste, promote efficiencies and a more rational use of the limited resources. It is a bumpy road ahead but today, as never before, state intervention is required to ensure health security to all, as an anti-poverty measure, particularly aimed at the poor and marginalised.\n\nThis article first appeared in the print edition on March 19, 2021 under the title \u2018The right to health\u2019.

Similarly, Dalbir Singh, who is facing alleged murder charges for the death of his daughter-in-law, has submitted through his counsel that his brother had moved a plea for an inquiry in his matter, wherein on September 19, 2020, he was declared innocent, and SSP Batala approved the report.\n\nJustice Bajaj after hearing the matter said, that this court does not find any merit in the argument that in view of supplementary reports under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C filed in favour of petitioners, the chargesheet under Section 173 (2) Cr.P.C filed earlier against them is wiped off, particularly when the reports are pending consideration before the respective trial courts, and thus declined the bail pleas.\n\nThe bench held that when investigation in both these FIRs was in progress, separate representations on behalf of the various accused persons or through their relatives were entertained by senior police officers, who ordered simultaneous inquiries to examine their innocence only. The inquiry reports were subsequently decorated as supplementary reports under Section 173(8) Cr.P.C and were placed before the trial court. In this way, the trial courts in both these cases are seized of two conflicting conclusions of investigation and inquiry carried by different functionaries of state police."},

Anne Lacaton had moved there to practice urban planning after her formal architectural education in France. Jean-Philippe Vassal, whom she met during the training, would often visit her in Niger. There, they saw how the country\u2019s desert landscape was filled with architecture that made the most of resources, with poetic innovation.\n\nFor them it was the second school of architecture. From the people, they would learn what generosity of spaces meant, caring for the climate and resources at hand, why economy was important and architecture had to be affordable. They had built a straw hut with bush branches that were easily available and stood through two years or wind and sun.\n\nThe duo knew then that demolition would never be a choice, they would have to reinvent and transform spaces, with simplicity and available resources.\n\nNewsletter | Click to get the day\u2019s best explainers in your inbox\n\nTheir Paris firm, Lacaton & Vassal, which started in 1987, has since then worked on these principles, be it social and private housing, public buildings, and educational and cultural institutions. With over 30 projects spread across Europe and West Africa, they are the 2021 Pritzker Laureates, who have been awarded \u201cArchitecture\u2019s Nobel Prize\u201d for their work in retrofitting buildings and changing social housing from inside out.\n\nTheir work and philosophy\n\nOne of their first projects was a private house in Bordeaux, France, completed in 1993. The Latapie House, for a couple and their two children, had to be expanded on a minimal budget.\n\nThe Latapie House, before renovation. (Photos: Philippe Ruault; Courtesy: The Pritzker Architecture Prize) The Latapie House, before renovation. (Photos: Philippe Ruault; Courtesy: The Pritzker Architecture Prize)\n\nThe architects opened up the space in front of the house, covering one side with opaque fibre-cement sheets and the other on the garden side with transparent polycarbonate sheeting, to form a conservatory. Meanwhile, they gave the facades movable panels which could open up to the sun and seasons, making room for light, intimacy, ventilation to fill the collapsible spaces within.\n\nThe Latapie House, after renovation. (Photos: Philippe Ruault; Courtesy: The Pritzker Architecture Prize) The Latapie House, after renovation. (Photos: Philippe Ruault; Courtesy: The Pritzker Architecture Prize)\n\nIn a talk at UCLA in 2015, Lacaton said, \u201cOur design philosophy is to make buildings that are beautiful, where people feel good in them, where the light inside is beautiful and the air pleasant, where exchange with the outside seems easy and gentle, and where life is simple and the sensations unexpected.\u201d\n\nAnother such project is the La Tour Bois le Pr\u00eatre in Paris. This 1960s housing block was renovated in 2011 by Lacaton and Vassal with their team, which gave the 96 families \u201cwinter gardens\u201d. Their strategy was to remove the original fa\u00e7ade and expand the area of the 17-storey building, thus giving residents fresh air and light.\n\nTheir primary motto is to not demolish, instead it to make additions that honour the present and yet use history as an inventory to adapt and adopt from.\n\nIn a recent interview, the duo said, \u201cWhen we start on a site, we never think in terms of form. Instead, we think of the project from the inside. We keen observe what we have and what to do with it\u2026 we are not looking from top down but from inside out.\u201d With deep respect in those living in these homes, the architects are very aware of the memories people carry with them.\n\nIn their 2017 project \u2014 the Grand Parc housing development in Bordeaux \u2014 they made generous extensions in the units for nearly 530 families, without making interventions in structure, stairs or the floors.\n\nThe Grand Parc housing development in Bordeaux. (Photos: Philippe Ruault; Courtesy: The Pritzker Architecture Prize) The Grand Parc housing development in Bordeaux. (Photos: Philippe Ruault; Courtesy: The Pritzker Architecture Prize)\n\nWhile many of their projects are in France, including \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019Architecture de Nantes (2009), the Cap Ferret House in Cap Ferret (1998), a social housing project for Cit\u00e9 Manifeste in Mulhouse (2005), P\u00f4le Universitaire de Sciences de Gestion in Bordeaux (2008), and the Palais de Tokyo in Paris (2013), they have offices, residences, and mixed-use projects in Toulouse, Hamburg, and Anderlecht, Belgium.\n\nAs academics, they are also very conscious of planning public space. Their approach to architecture also spills into their ideas or urban planning. For them, public space in cities is about connections. A master plan for a city always works from the larger to the smaller scale. They turn that idea on its head by suggesting that planners should start from the living room, \u201cbecause you first live for yourself, then your community, then the public\u201d.\n\nTheir incremental approach was best seen in the town square project initiated by the Bordeaux City Council in 1996. The triangular patch bordered by trees already appeared beautiful to Lacaton (66) and Vassal (67). When they spoke to the residents, they too didn\u2019t want any embellishments that would ruin the feel of the place. So finally, the architects did nothing except replace the gravel, clean the square, trim the lime trees and modify the traffic.\n\nWhat the Pritzker jury has to say\n\nHeaded by Chilean architect Alejandro Aravena, the jury see in their work, \u201ca commitment to restorative architecture, at this at once technological, innovative, and ecologically responsive and can be pursued without nostalgia.\u201d They felt that the architect of Lacaton and Vassal is more than just buildings, and that best architecture is always \u201cthoughtful, respectful and responsible\u201d."},

Health Minister Jens Spahn said suspending the vaccine out of caution had been the right call \u201cuntil the clustering of this very rare type of thrombosis had been examined.\n\n\u201cFrance too said it would resume use of the vaccine, with Prime Minister Jean Castex saying he would receive the shot himself on Friday afternoon. Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said Italy would do the same, and that his government\u2019s priority remained to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible.\n\nSpain said it was evaluating a possible resumption, while Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania said they would restart administering the vaccine. Many governments had said the decision to pause inoculations was out of an abundance of caution. But experts have warned political interference could undermine public confidence in vaccinations as governments struggle to tame more infectious virus variants.\n\n\u201cWe trust that, after the regulators\u2019 careful decisions, vaccinations can once again resume across Europe,\u201d said AstraZeneca Chief Medical Officer Ann Taylor in a statement.\n\nEUROPE LAGS BRITAIN, U.S.\n\nThe EMA\u2019s review covered 20 million people given the AstraZeneca shot in the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA), which links 30 European countries. Safety concerns had led at least 13 European countries to stop administering the shot, slowing an already faltering inoculation campaign in the EU, which lags Britain and the United States.\n\nBritain\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said earlier that it was investigating five cases of the rare brain blood clot that had been reported out of 11 million shots administered in the UK. It said it would investigate reports of clots in the cerebral veins (sinus vein thrombosis, or CSVT) occurring together with lowered platelets soon after vaccination. But the agency said use of the vaccine should continue and one official said Britain\u2019s rollout would likely continue even if a link was proved.\n\nThe AstraZeneca shot was among the first and cheapest of the COVID-19 vaccines to be developed and launched at volume and is set to be the mainstay of vaccination programmes in much of the developing world. \u201cThe EMA\u2019s (verdict) now provides clarity about the safety of this vaccine, which should now be vaccinated at a high rate after this safety stop in order to efficiently prevent the actual risk, i.e. sometimes serious medical harm from Covid-19,\u201d said Clemens Wendtner, head of infectious diseases at Munich clinic Schwabing.\n\n\n\nThe drugmaker\u2019s own review covering more than 17 million people who have received its shot in the EU and Britain found no evidence of increased risk of blood clots. The World Health Organization this week also reaffirmed its support for the shot.\n\nThe EMA said it would update its guidance on the AstraZeneca vaccine to include an explanation for patients about the potential risks and information for healthcare professionals. The agency said it is in touch with regulators around the world to keep tabs on possible side effects of all COVID-19 vaccines."},

(Express Photo by Anju Agnihotri Chaba/Representational)\n\nDays after the Food Corporation of India (FCI) directed the Punjab government to provide land records of farmers so as to make direct online payment of MSP to their accounts, the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has also sent a letter to the state to implement online direct payment system and compliance of Public Financial Management System (PFMS) from the coming rabi marketing season (2021-2022).\n\nThe letter also said that these guidelines are followed by majority states except Punjab, where MSP payments are still being paid through arhtiyas.\n\nThe Centre has been issuing such directions to the state government for the past couple of years. But in Punjab, payment of farmers comes in the accounts of the arhtiyas (commission agents) who further make it to the farmers through cheques or online transfer.\n\nIn the letter addressed to the Principal Secretary (Food), Government of Punjab, Deputy Secretary GOI, mentioned that he has been directed to refer the instructions issued by the Centre, stipulating mandatory use of the Expenditure Advance Transfer (EAT) module of PFMS by June 15th 2018, failing which no further funds released to agencies (read procurement agencies).\n\nPFMS is a web-based online software application developed and implemented by the office of the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) under which direct payment to the beneficiaries are made for government schemes. But here, linking farmers accounts with PFMS was just to pay their crop money directly into their accounts.\n\nThe letter (copy of which is available with The Indian Express) further says that the objective of PFMS/EAT Module is end-to-end tracking of the funds till the last mile beneficiary.\n\nAs per PFMS mandate, the rollout will also result in improved programme administration and management, reduction of float in the system, direct payment to beneficiaries and greater transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. In view of this, the department has regularly pursued with states to implement the directions of online payment directly into the farmers\u2019 bank accounts and compliance of PFMS.\n\nThe letter also stated that the matter has also been discussed in recent meetings held in this department on January 19, 23, 25, 2021.\n\nIn case payment is done through a state portal, the state government is required to integrate their software with PFMS so that MSP payment to farmers could be captured on a real time basis. It is also requested that a report on preparedness for implementation of aforesaid directions may be furnished as early as possible, said the letter.\n\nThe government mainly wants to keep arhtiyas away from payments of MSP to farmers.\n\n\u201cFarmers\u2019 accounts are never linked to the PFMS portal in Punjab as they never got direct payment for wheat and paddy in their accounts till date under this system. Instead of making payment to farmers under PFMS, the state government had put a condition on arhtiyas that every farmer will get payment through cheques from their respective arhtiyas but here too, unfair practices are adopted by arhtiyas, who at the time of issuing cheques to the farmers, send their munim (accountant) with farmers to the bank for its encashment and after encashment, the munim pays the farmers after making several cuts. A common farmer, who is dependent on arhtiyas, never gets full MSP from the arhtiya,\u201d said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary, Bharti Kisan Union (BKU) Dakuanda, adding that the arhtiyas\u2019 main business is money lending to the farmers at high rate of interest as there is hardly any proper record of this and no government control.\n\n\u201cDue to this, majority arhtiyas are involved in the exploitation of farmers, who keep on paying interest of over interest on principal amounts for decades.\n\n\u201cIf farmers are dependent on them, that does not mean that they get the license of exploiting them as fair deal is needed here,\u201d he added.\n\nIn several cases, advance cheques are taken by \u2018arhtiyas\u2019 from farmers at the time of giving money on credit under their money lending business to him (farmer) and these cheques are used at the time of crop payment.\n\n\u201cWe are not against commission agents but the unscrupulous money lending business of them with the farmers,\u201d said Jagmohan Singh.\n\nProf. Sukhpal Singh, Principal Economist (Agriculture Marketing), Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) Ludhiana, said: \u201cArhtiyas are also making big bucks by providing credit to the farmers at 18 to 24 per cent rate of interest and according to an estimate, around 20 per cent (Rs 18,000 to 20,000 crore) of the total debt of the farmers in Punjab is provided by the arhtiyas, who hardly provide any fair record to the farmers about their return and farmers always remained indebted to them.\n\n\u201cArhtiyas who always object to direct payment will not be able to charge money from farmers according to their own wishes after PFMS system,\u201d said another farmer leader, adding that if arhtiyas are fair in their money lending system, then most of the farmers would have been debt-free today in the state and it is very much possible if the state government sets proper norms for arhtiyas.\n\nPunjab alone has some licensed 48,000 arhtiyas, of which 28,000-odd are active. They basically provide platforms outside their shops where the produce of farmers is unloaded, cleaned, auctioned, weighed and bagged, before being loaded and moved from the mandi premises.\n\nFor these services, they are given a 2.5 per cent commission over and above the MSP and this commission comes to around Rs 1,400 crore annually for procurement of the wheat and paddy only, and the Centre does not want to pay it.\n\nPrincipal Secretary (Food) Punjab KAP Sinha said that under the PFMS system, arhtiyas will get their commission for the facilities they provide. \u201cBut more than commission, arhtiyas are interested in this unfair money lending business,\u2019\u2019 said Jagsir Singh, a BKU (Ugrahan) leader."},

On the day after the arrest, the three were produced before the magistrate, however, they did not mention about the assault to the magistrate.\n\nOn being asked about the allegations of assault, PRO Chandigarh Police DSP Charanjeet Singh denied that any such assault took place in police custody. \u201cThe three were medically examined and produced before the court.\n\nLater, before entering the jail as well they were medically examined. Thus, it is an after thought of the accused to get benefit in the case by levelling false allegations against the police personnel,\u201d said PRO Chandigarh Police."},

(AP Photo)\n\nOn March 17, 2021, the European Commission proposed to create a Digital Green Certificate to facilitate the safe and free movement of citizens within the European Union (EU) amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNewsletter | Click to get the day\u2019s best explainers in your inbox\n\nSo, what exactly is the Digital Green Certificate?\n\nA Digital Green Certificate is proof that a person has either been vaccinated against COVID-19, has received a negative test result or has recovered from COVID-19. The key features of the certificate are that it will be in digital or paper format complete with a QR code and will be free of charge.\n\nThe certificate can be issued by authorities, including hospitals, testing centres and health authorities. Once the proposal for digital certificates is finalised, it will be accepted in all EU countries and will help to ensure that the restrictions imposed in different areas within the EU can be lifted in a coordinated manner.\n\nAll EU citizens or third-country nationals who are legally staying in the EU will be able to use these digital certificates and thereby will be exempted from free movement restrictions. In case an EU member country requires a person to quarantine or undergo a test, it will have to notify the Commission and all other member states justifying its decision.\n\nSignificantly, the brand or kind of anti-COVID vaccine received does not matter for the certificate to be issued. \u201cWhen it comes to waiving free movement restrictions, Member States will have to accept vaccination certificates for vaccines which received EU marketing authorisation,\u201d the Commission has said.\n\nThe certificates are expected to be rolled out by the summer, after countries have had the time to set up the required digital infrastructure.\n\nWhat is the need for such a document?\n\nIn the EU and across the world, the tourism industry has been severely impacted due to the spread of the disease. Many countries have, therefore, been contemplating digital certificates or passports that will be proof that a person has been vaccinated or has recovered from COVID-19.\n\nIn February, Israel became the first country to issue certificates called \u201cvaccine passports\u201d that will allow vaccinated individuals to use some facilities and attend events. Last month, Denmark also said that it was in the process of rolling out digital passports that would act as proof for those individuals who have been vaccinated.\n\nEven so, as early as May 2020, countries such as Chile had proposed \u201crelease certificates\u201d meant for those who had recovered from COVID-19. But the World Health Organisation (WHO) had advised against using such certificates because of lack of evidence that a person infected with Covid-19 could not get the infection again.\n\nHowever, it is now known that re-infection in case of COVID-19 is rare. Research published in the journal Lancet recently points out that most people who have had COVID-19 are protected from re-infection for at least a period of six months. However, the study says that elderly patients are more prone to reinfections. This study found that only about 0.65 percent of the people in the study returned a positive RT-PCR test twice."},

The airport projects such as the international one in Jewar or the one that will be developed in Ayodhya will take time. So, the government is banking on expressways as it completes its fifth year in power in 2022.\n\nThe Mayawati government, which was in power from 2007 to 2012, built the Yamuna Expressway, while the Akhilesh government that ruled from 2012 to 2017 paved the Lucknow-Agra Expressway. The present government is aiming to build at least two expressways \u2013 Purvanchal Expressway and the Bundelkhand Expressway, the foundation stone of which was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It also has the target to start constructing the third one, Ganga Expressway, before the 2022 elections are announced.\n\nAmid the achievements being listed by the government, The Indian Express looks into the major infrastructure projects, on which the government pins its hopes, along with their progress and expected dates of completion.\n\nPurvanchal Expressway\n\n* Nearly 340 km long, the six-lane access control project is set to boost Purvanchal (eastern Uttar Pradesh), which is the state government\u2019s focus at present. The region includes Varanasi, the Parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gorakhpur, the home town of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Moreover, the road will also provide a direct high-speed road link to the National Capital that leads to not just eastern UP, but also Bihar.\n\nTotal length: 340.82 km.\n\nCost: Rs 22,496.93 crore\n\nCoverage: Starting from Chandsarai village in Lucknow district; culminate at Ghazipur\u2019s Hyderia village, which is 18 km from the UP-Bihar border. It will cover several districts such as Lucknow, Barabanki, Amethi, Sultanpur, Ayodhya, Ambedkarnagar, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur. Moreover, an airstrip is also being developed on the expressway in Sultanpur district for emergency landing of Airforce aircraft.\n\nProgress: Nearly 98 per cent of earth work and 97 per cent of work on structures have been completed, while the total physical progress of the project is 80 per cent.\n\nDeadline: While the scheduled date of completion of the project has been set as October 2021, government plans to open the main carriageway soon.\n\nBundelkhand Expressway\n\n* Like the Purvanchal Expressway, the foundation stone of this project was also laid by the PM. The project is as ambitious as the Centre\u2019s \u201cDefence Corridor project\u201d, which is being built along this. It aims to connect another underdeveloped region \u2013 Bundelkhand \u2013 with not just the state capital but also the national capital through two existing expressways.\n\nLength (initially four-lane): 296.26 km.\n\nCost: Rs 14,709.71 crore\n\nCoverage: Starting from Gonda village in Chitrakoot district of Bundelkhand and ending at Agra-Lucknow Expressway, near Kudrail village of Etawah district. It will cover Chitrakoot, Banda, Mahoba, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Auraiya and Etawah districts.\n\nProgress: 82 per cent of earth work is complete, while 512 out of total 819 structures have been built. The total project progress is about 50 per cent. Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, the government claimed to be ahead of the schedule. While the deadline is March, 2022, the government is aiming to complete the work on main carriageway by the end of this year.\n\nThe government aims to complete work on the main carriageway of Bundelkhand Expressway by the end of this year.

(Express photo)\n\nGanga Expressway\n\n* Since the project was announced recently, so, the government is rushing to complete land acquisition, so that it can lay the foundation stone by year-end. It is expected to be one of the longest expressway projects in the country. Initially, it was planned from Meerut in western Uttar Pradesh to Prayagraj. Later, the government planned to further expand this expressway from Hardwar in Uttarakhand to Varanasi in eastern Uttar Pradesh.\n\nProgress: Nearly 7,800 hectares of land is required for the expressway. The government claimed to have acquired about 1,000 hectare of land for this project. Provision for further land acquisition has also been made in the recent state annual Budget. The government aims to complete land acquisition by year-end, so that at least the foundation stone for this project can be laid before the 2022 elections are announced.\n\nGorakhpur Link Expressway\n\n* The nearly 91-km expressway is planned to connect Gorakhpur and Purvanchal Expressway. The project will start from Gorakhpur bypass and connect with Azamgarh district on Purvanchal Expressway.\n\nWhile nearly 31 per cent of the earth work is completed, the total physical progress is about 13 per cent. While the scheduled date of completion is April, 2022, sources said the developers are trying to speed up work."},

A technology for imparting elasticity and structural strength to bajra and maize dough, making their chapattis as soft as from regular wheat atta flour.\n\nThese are potentially game-changing innovations developed by women scientists from the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI).\n\nThe Pusa-Farm SunFridge (Pusa-FSF), an on-farm green energy refrigeration system, is the culmination of more than five years of work by Sangeeta Chopra, principal scientist at IARI\u2019s Division of Agricultural Engineering, in collaboration with researchers from the Michigan State University.\n\n\u201cThe idea of minimising post-harvest losses, by having a cold store at the farm itself and running on solar power without any electricity from the grid, always interested me. Farmers usually harvest tomatoes, brinjal, okra, chilli, beans, peas, fruits or even cut flowers over multiple pickings. If their produce remains fresh through cooling, they can avoid distress sales and wait for prices to improve,\u201d said Chopra.\n\nSangeeta Chopra at the Pusa-Farm SunFridge in the IARI campus. Sangeeta Chopra at the Pusa-Farm SunFridge in the IARI campus.\n\nThe 10x10x10 ft cold store structure designed by her can stock enough vegetables and fruits to fully load a Tata 407 mini truck. This can be taken in a single trip to the market when the prices are right.\n\nThe Pusa-FSF has rooftop solar panels that generate 5 kilowatt power, of which 3 KW is used to run a 1.5-tonne air-conditioner and bring down the temperature inside the structure to 3-4\u00b0C. This has been done by dispensing with the thermostat that limits the normal cooling in ACs to 16-17\u00b0C. The panels also power a 105-watt submersible pump circulating about 1,000 litres of water from a tank through overhead PVC pipes. The AC and submersible pump operate throughout the day when the sun is out and automatically shut in the evenings.\n\n\u201cAt night, there is only passive evaporative cooling, with the water chilled during the day acting as a natural heat sink. This, along with the materials we have used (mesh, wetted nylon felt fabric walls, styrofoam/thermocol insulation and autoclaved aerated concrete floor), ensures that the nighttime temperatures are also maintained within 8-12\u00b0C,\u201d explained Chopra.\n\nThe Pusa-FSF, built on dismantlable mild steel frames and plates, has been installed at IARI\u2019s New Delhi campus and two villages \u2013 Picholiya in Rajasthan\u2019s Ajmer district and Chamrara in Panipat, Haryana.\n\n\u201cThe total cost is Rs 5-5.5 lakh, for which farmers may need support similar to that in solar irrigation,\u201d noted Indra Mani, head of IARI\u2019s agricultural engineering division. The technology has been licensed to Jaipur-based SND Infraprojects Pvt. Ltd and \u201cwe are in discussion with three other firms for its commercialisation,\u201d he added.\n\nSangeeta Chopra with IARI director AK Singh (right) and agricultural engineering head Indra Mani Sangeeta Chopra with IARI director AK Singh (right) and agricultural engineering head Indra Mani\n\nIndia has an estimated four lakh-plus installed solar water pumps. An average 5-horsepower pump costing Rs 2.5 lakh attracts 70-90% subsidy. According to Raghav Agarwal, director of SND Infraprojects, all farmers with solar pumps are a potential market for the Pusa-FSF: \u201cThey know how solar power can irrigate their fields. They will understand how it can also be used for refrigeration and extending the shelf life of their produce\u201d.\n\nBut Chopra isn\u2019t the only one whose work is at the cutting edge. At IARI\u2019s Division of Biochemistry, Shelly Praveen and T. Vinutha have developed a technology for extraction of gluten from wheat dough and its regeneration in bajra (pearl-millet) and makka (maize) flour, which can be easily kneaded to yield soft rotis, pooris and a variety of bakery products.\n\nWheat has roughly 13% protein content. Up to 80% of that comprises glutenin and gliadin. These are proteins that bind to each other and form a network whenever water and energy (through kneading) is added to the wheat flour. The gluten formed by the combination of the two proteins creates the elastic texture in the dough that allows the breads to come out light and fluffy.\n\nBajra, maize, jowar (sorghum), ragi and other millets contain comparable levels of protein and more vitamins, minerals, crude fibre and other nutrients than wheat. But they don\u2019t have any gluten proteins, which results in poor dough quality.\n\nPraveen\u2019s and Vinutha\u2019s work hasn\u2019t just been limited to extracting the gluten after making wheat dough and removing the starch. \u201cThe proteins extracted and dried into powder should also have the capacity for regeneration or forming gluten networks in non-wheat dough. Soft atta requires the gluten proteins added in the flour to achieve proper networking for retaining their original viscoelasticity and water-absorbing properties,\u201d pointed out Praveen.\n\nThe two scientists have created gluten-based soft bajra and makka atta that combine the superior nutritional composition of these two cereals with the better dough and chapatti-making quality of wheat. Their \u2018Hallur\u2019 soft bajra flour \u2013 containing 23% protein, including 15% of pearl millet and 8% gluten \u2013 can be used to make kachori and even cookies, cup cakes and pizza slices. They claim to have also prepared nachos from their \u2018Makai\u2019 soft maize atta.\n\n\u201cFarmers will have incentive to produce nutri-cereals only when there is demand. One way to boost their consumption, especially in metros and urban centres, is by ease of making dough. That\u2019s what our scientists have done,\u201d the director of IARI, A.K. Singh, told The Indian Express.\n\nInterestingly, half of IARI\u2019s divisions \u2013 including biochemistry, plant pathology, entomology, nematology, microbiology, agricultural physics, agricultural chemicals and agricultural economics \u2013 are headed by women. And that\u2019s something not many institutions in India can boast of."},

The annual event is a celebration of one of the most important parts of our daily routines. World Sleep Day is organised by the World Sleep Day Committee of the World Sleep Society and the aim of the day is also to create awareness around sleep-related issues and the prevention and management of sleep disorders.\n\nWhile the occasion marks a date every year where sleep disorders and how to prevent them are brought to light, It is important for humans to maintain a healthy sleep cycle on a daily basis. A good sleep of 6-8 hours is crucial to the body and its maximum functionality. However, we often lose track of our decreasing sleep times as our lives continue to be taken over by studies, work, and play.\n\nTo make sure you maintain a healthy sleep cycle, here are seven apps that will help you get the right amount of shut-eye.\n\nCalm\n\nCalm is a meditation app that you can use right before going to bed. Like most apps on this list, Calm will help you go to sleep faster with sleep stories, soothing music, and even guided lessons on gentle movements that relax the body. The free version of the app should help most people out when going to bed and even tackling issues like anxiety. However, users can also subscribe to engage with some paid content.\n\nHeadspace\n\nHeadspace is all about meditation and using meditation techniques to calm your mind. Apart from sleep sounds that help you rest well, the app also features multiple courses all based on topics around living mindfully and others. The app also has some neat tricks like manipulating the speaker\u2019s voice to be louder or softer than the background ambient sounds. A free version of the app will provide you a limited number of sessions per day, but you can always go premium and get unlimited access to content.\n\nRelax melodies\n\nRelax Melodies, as the name suggests is an app that can play various sounds to help you go to sleep, and maintain a good sleep as well. You can program the app to play music all night or to shut down after a period of time. The number of sleep sounds you get here is limited when you\u2019re using the free version. However, there\u2019s another catch \u2013 you cannot use another app when Relax Melodies is in action. This, however, may actually be a good thing and minimize distractions so you can sleep faster.\n\nNoisli\n\nNoisli also provides you with relaxing sounds. However, its biggest feature is the ability to customise your sounds as per your taste and ambience to create your own soundscape. Noisli can be used for anything from drowning out annoying sounds when you\u2019re trying to work, to set the perfect sleep-inducing stage for you at night. A free version gets you 16 sounds and 15 hours of streaming a day, while a paid version gets you 28 sounds, no limit on streaming, and some more features.\n\nSleep Cycle\n\nSleep Cycle is an app that helps you monitor your sleep time and patterns. The app also has some great features up its sleeve, including monitoring your sleep in real-time by analysing the sounds you make via your phone. This can then be used to wake you up when your body is in its lightest phase of sleep, therefore, allowing you to wake up feeling fresher. You can also set an approximate alarm so the app does not wake you up too late. Premium features include information on how the weather affects your sleep, and the ability to take sleep notes, among other features.\n\nBonus\n\nDid you know your Apple Watch can natively track sleep?\n\nSleep tracking can be much more accurate and insightful with the help of a wearable like the Apple Watch. The Apple Watch lets you create a schedule and a bedtime routine to help you reach your sleep numbers. The Apple Health app also helps you track your sleep. When you have gotten enough sleep the Apple Watch haptic alarm feature can also wake you up silently, without disturbing the sleep of those around you."},

But the Sar-karyawah is elected by the ABPS in Nagpur, once every three years \u2014 the duration of his tenure.\n\nThe ABPS meets for three days in the second or third week of March, usually concluding its meeting on the second or third Sunday of the month. This year, it is just for two days starting Friday.\n\nThe annual meeting is held at various venues around the country, but once every three years, it is held in Nagpur where the ABPS elects the Sar-karyawah \u2014 until exceptional circumstances led to the change of venue this year. Last year\u2019s annual meeting too was scheduled in Bengaluru but was called off due to the Covid-19 outbreak \u2014after several delegates had already reached the venue.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 JOIN NOW \ud83d\udce3: The Express Explained Telegram Channel\n\nThe election process\n\nThe election is usually on the second day of the three-day meeting; it will be on the second day of this year\u2019s two day meeting. Normally, the incumbent Sar-karyawah informs delegates about the work done during his tenure, and announces that since his term has ended, a new Sar-karyawah must be elected. An election officer is then appointed from among the senior functionaries. A senior functionary proposes a name for the new Sar-karyawah. This name is generally accepted, and the Sar-karyawah is declared elected. After he is elected, the new Sar-karyawah announces his team.\n\nThe present system of holding the Sar-karyawah election was adopted in the early fifties. Elections were not held during the Emergency (1975-77), and in 1993 when the RSS was banned after the demolition of the Babri Masjid.\n\nIncumbent & contenders\n\nThe executive head of the RSS has full control over the organisation\u2019s every activity. The current Sar-karyawah, Suresh Bhaiyaji Joshi, completes his fourth three-year term this year. The late H V Sheshadri is the only other one to have been Sar-karyawah for four consecutive terms (from 1987 to 2000).\n\nThe normal practice is for the new Sar-karyawah to be chosen from among the incumbent\u2019s deputies, or Sah-sar-karyawahs. Bhaiyyaji Joshi\u2019s sah-sar-karyawahs are Dattatreya Hosabale, Suresh Soni, Dr Krishna Gopal, Manmohan Vaidya, B Bhagaiah and C R Mukunda.\n\nThere have been exceptions when the Sar-karyawah has not been from among the Sah-sar-karyawahs. When Joshi, for example, was elected Sar-karyawah in 2009, he was Akhil Bhartiya Sewa Pramukh of the RSS, not Sah-sar-karwayah. Even Joshi is eligible for re-election. But he is 74, and a point being discussed is that whoever is elected this year should also continue into the next tenure, with the RSS centenary year coming up in 2025."},

(Reuters)\n\nIn a reprieve for the debt and equity markets, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday announced that the interest rates are being kept near zero. While it maintained that it will continue the flow of credit to households and businesses and support the economy, it indicated that there may not be any interest rate hike through 2023.\n\nWhile that boosted investor sentiment and led to a rise in major indices around the world, the Indian market fell by over 1% on Thursday, despite opening on a strong note. The Sensex fell 585 points or 1.2% to close at 49,216 on Thursday, taking the fall over the last five trading sessions to 2,063 points or 4%. The weakness continued even as the Fed announcement comes as a positive for equity and debt markets. Market participants feel that while the market may be witnessing some correction on account of concerns over rise in bond yields and domestic factors including rise in Covid-19 numbers over the last week, the trajectory for the market remains upwards and investors should stay put and invest on dips.\n\nNewsletter | Click to get the day\u2019s best explainers in your inbox\n\nWhat has the Fed announced?\n\nThe Federal Reserve maintained that the path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the pandemic and progress on vaccinations. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said that it expects to maintain an accommodative stance in its monetary policy until it achieves maximum employment and inflation of 2% over the longer run.\n\n\u201cThe Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee\u2019s assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee\u2019s maximum employment and price stability goals,\u201d the statement read. It said these asset purchases will help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.\n\nWhile the Fed has announced it will keep interest rates near zero, market experts say the issue hovers around the rise in bond yields which impacts the equity markets, and that is where there is a disconnect between market and central banks. While central banks can keep their policy rates low, the long-term bond yields are getting determined by factors such as expectations of higher growth and inflation. \u201cIf the yields start rising then they start competing with equities, and that impacts equity market movement,\u201d said Pankaj Pandey, head of research at ICICIdirect.com.\n\nWhat does it mean for Indian markets?\n\nWith the Fed having indicated there may not be a rise in interest rates through 2023, market experts feel the announcement would calm the markets that have been wary of a rate hike earlier than expected. \u201cIf we go by that, it will have a soothing effect on both the debt and equity markets. It gives nearly two years\u2019 time and that will provide stability to the markets,\u201d said C J George, MD, Geojit Financial Services.\n\nA fund manager with a leading fund house said if a sudden rise in bond yields raised concern on the continuation of FPI fund flow, the Fed\u2019s announcement that it will continue to provide liquidity for a reasonable period will ensure the equity markets will remain strong. \u201cThere may be ups and downs depending upon domestic news flow around Covid-19 and other factors, but overall the trajectory of the markets is upwards and it will be supported by a rise in earnings, growth in economy and fund flow by FPIs,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are some who say that if the bond yields in the US keep rising, it will have an impact on the fund flow into emerging market equities. \u201cHowever, if we keep our house in order and increase the risk return potential of our stock through generating higher growth by executing asset monetisation, capital expenditure plan and stability in policy making, India will continue to attract foreign funds into equities,\u201d said Nilesh Shah, MD, Kotak Mahindra AMC.\n\nIn the second half of February, G-Sec bond yields spiked from around 6% on February 15 to over 6.2% on February 22 and have stayed around those levels till date. This was in line with a spike in bond yields in the US and other developed markets.\n\nIt is important to note that while foreign portfolio investors have pulled out a net of over Rs 15,700 crore from the Indian debt market between February and March 2021, they have continued with their net investment in Indian equities \u2014 Rs 38,764 crore between February to March. Over the last five trading sessions, when the Sensex has lost 4%, FPIs have put in a net investment of Rs 15,700 crore even as domestic institutional investors have sold equity holdings worth a net of Rs 3,750 crore.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 JOIN NOW \ud83d\udce3: The Express Explained Telegram Channel\n\nWill the markets rise and what should investors do?\n\nWhile rising bond yields, a jump in Covid numbers and announcement of lockdowns across several districts by various state governments has dampened investor sentiments domestically and has led to some profit booking on highs, market participants say that since central banks globally are expected to support their respective economies, provide liquidity and keep the interest rates low, equity markets will benefit.\n\nThey are, however, keeping a close eye on bond yields. There is a feeling in the market that bond yields in US up to levels of 2-2.25% will not have a huge bearing on equity markets, but if the levels inching closer to 3%, it will start hurting equities both in developed and emerging markets.\n\nBesides concerns around bond yield and rising Covid numbers, Pandey said equity markets have also been impacted by profit booking which some participants go for towards the end of the financial year. \u201cI have a feeling that markets would stabilise April onwards,\u201d he said.\n\nThere is also a sense that as more and more people get vaccinated over the next three to six months and the economy stabilises further, earnings growth and global liquidity flow will push the markets further up.\n\nWhile some investors are concerned over the fall in the markets in the recent past, the CIO of a leading mutual fund said, \u201cWe are still in a bull market and one must understand that a 2000-point correction after a 20,000-point rally is not something to be worried about. Also, while central bankers won\u2019t talk much about bond yields, they will intervene when required. For now, their primary concern is supporting growth and employment generation.\u201d"},

(Pat Nabong/Chicago Sun-Times via AP)\n\nVaccinating all adults in the UK is unlikely to achieve herd immunity and fully contain the coronavirus, according to a modelling study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases Journal. A gradual release of control measures, high vaccine uptake, and a vaccine with high protection against infection is essential to minimise future waves of infection, the authors said.\n\nThe analysis was done before early real-world data from vaccination rollout studies. Preliminary findings suggest that vaccination does offer a level of protection against infection, but the exact level is still unclear. For this reason, the authors examined a range of levels of protection against infection.\n\nThe authors note that their model does not account for the emergence of new variants, to which the vaccine might offer less protection, nor for the effects of waning immunity, which might necessitate additional vaccination. They also note that they are unable to look at the effects of relaxing individual control measures.\n\nThis study modelled the combined interaction of the UK vaccination rollout with different scenarios of relaxing control measures, to predict the R-number and deaths and hospital admissions due to Covid-19 from January 2021 to January 2024.\n\nThe model assumed vaccine uptake would be 95% in those aged 80 and older, 85% in those aged 50\u201379, and 75% in those aged 18\u201349. Vaccine protection against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88% based on phase 3 trial data from the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK. The vaccines\u2019 protection against infection was varied in four scenarios (0%, 35%, 60%, 85%).\n\nAccording to the researchers, the findings suggest that although vaccination can substantially reduce R, it may not be enough to drive R below 1 without other control measures. Under the most optimistic scenario for protection against infection (85%), the R number is estimated to be 1.58 without other controls.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 JOIN NOW \ud83d\udce3: The Express Explained Telegram Channel\n\nAs vaccination alone is not expected to drive R below 1, removing all restrictions after the vaccination rollout is complete is predicted to lead to another wave of infections with a substantial number of deaths. The scale of future waves and the number of deaths is influenced by how early and over what time-scales measures are relaxed, the vaccine\u2019s level of protection against infection, and vaccine uptake.\n\nThe authors considered abrupt releases of some measures (from current restrictions to a situation comparable to September 2020) with a vaccine that offers 85% protection and calculated the number of deaths from January 2021 until January 2024. A partial release in February 2021 was estimated to lead to 130,100 deaths by January 2024, whereas partial release in April 2021 lowers this to 61,400 deaths and partial release in June 2021 to 53,900 deaths, highlighting the impact of the vaccination programme rollout. These estimates all include the 49,300 deaths that have already occurred this year."},

In fact, going by the state of the labour market in Delhi, the distress in large sections of the labour force continues unabated. As reported in this paper, a Delhi government commissioned survey shows that even after economic activities began to gain traction with the easing of the lockdown restrictions, the unemployment rate stood at a steep 28.5 per cent in October-November 2020, as compared to 11.1 per cent in January-February, before the pandemic had hit. In the case of women, it had worsened from 25.6 per cent before the pandemic to 54.7 per cent in October-November. This is an alarming situation.\n\nThe extent of the labour market scarring during this period has been enormous. The periodic labour force survey released by the National Statistical Office had shown a sharp rise in the unemployment rate in urban areas during April-June 2020. The unemployment rate for those aged 15 years and above had risen to 20.8 per cent during April-June 2020, from 9.1 per cent during January-March 2020. Even the labour participation rate had fallen during this period, indicating that many workers simply opted out of the labour force. As economic activities gained traction in the months thereafter, at the national level, the unemployment rate is likely to have declined. But this recovery is unlikely to have been even across various segments of the labour force, and the situation in Delhi likely mirrors trends in other parts of the country.\n\nIn rural areas too, data on work demanded under MGNREGA suggests continuing labour market distress. In February the number of additional households demanding work was around 64 lakh, indicative of a continuing lack of absorptive capacity in rural areas. Yet during this period, when more government support was needed, many state governments cut back on spending. Data from PRS Legislative Research shows that the Delhi government also spent 9 per cent less than what it had budgeted for in 2020-21. Given the extent of the labour market scarring, far greater policy support is needed."},

But it is, sadly, already in decline. It took only about seven years for its founders and trustees to let down the fundamental idea that animated its institution. It was, in its own words, \u201ca pioneer in its focus on providing a liberal education at par with the best in the world\u201d \u2014 a \u201cprivate non-profit university, an unprecedented example of collective public philanthropy in India\u201d \u201ccommitted to maintaining the highest intellectual and academic standards\u201d. The resignation of Pratap Bhanu Mehta puts a question mark on those claims and credentials. One of the country\u2019s pre-eminent scholars and public intellectuals, who unsparingly and courageously asks questions of power and the powerful, whoever they may be, whatever be their political colour \u2014 The Indian Express is privileged to carry his columns on these pages \u2014 has been compelled to step down, first as vice-chancellor and now as professor. The circumstances indict the university\u2019s establishment as much as they point fingers at the political regime.\n\nWhen it was set up, Ashoka University seemed to be taking an important step towards addressing a great deficit in higher education. The public university had long declined due to fiscal exhaustion and breakdown of the state system combined with the exit of the Indian elites from public institutions. That, over the last couple of decades or so, had led to the proliferation of private institutions, but mostly in professional education. In its stated commitment to the liberal arts, Ashoka seemed to make a prominent and welcome promise \u2014 to harness the resources of private philanthropy to address failures and deficiencies of both the state and the market. Mehta\u2019s exit from its faculty is a seminal moment because it points to the university\u2019s unwillingness and inability to protect the freedom of expression and ideas that is an inalienable part of that commitment. It is true that the challenge of institutional autonomy is sharpened terribly by the dominant political ideology that has shown a will to conquer all spaces, and which will not hesitate to weaponise the mandate to target dissent. It is also true that the larger environment is one in which the countervailing and unelected institutions that were supposed to, in the constitutional design, apply the check and maintain the balance, are not holding up. They are caving in.\n\nAnd yet, Messrs Ashok Trivedi, Pramath Raj Sinha, Sanjeev Bikhchandani, Ashish Dhawan, Vineet Gupta, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Manish Sabharwal, to name just a few of the University\u2019s distinguished trustees, need to ask themselves: Where to, now? By bending when asked, they may have inaugurated the slide, and surrendered the possibilities of the university\u2019s rise. Because vindictiveness feeds on cowardice. And because even though the institution cannot be equated with the individual, Mehta\u2019s departure sends out a signal much larger than him. As former Chief Economic Advisor and economist, Arvind Subramanian, who has also resigned saying he is \u201cdevastated\u201d by Mehta\u2019s going, has put it: Ashoka \u201c\u2026 can no longer provide a space for academic expression and freedom\u201d. That\u2019s the message to students, faculty \u2014 and to the next generation waiting to go to college. That a fancy campus and a bunch of glittering CVs does never an institution make."},

However, despite fulfilling multiple roles in the fight against the pandemic, Dhivar is among more than 70,000 mitanins across the state who are yet to receive the full payment of the promised Covid bonus, besides irregular disbursement of task-based incentives.\n\nA mitanin \u2013 which means \u201cfemale friend\u201d in the local dialect \u2013 is a community health volunteer assigned to each village under the Chhattisgarh government\u2019s health programme.\n\nIn Chhattisgarh, the National Health Mission, in April, promised Rs 1,000 as additional incentive but the mitanins were only paid for two months. According to sources, the money to be paid to a mitanin comes from both state and Central share.\n\nIn Dantewada\u2019s Toyalanka, besides checking up on children, pregnant mothers and the elderly, Bindu Sodhi (45) also had to keep a vigil at quarantine centers, while conducting door-to-door scanning in semi-urban areas and taking people with symptoms for tests as needed. And now, with the government rolling out the Covid vaccination programme, Sodhi and other mitanins are also accompanying the elderly to the vaccination centers \u2014 often far away and at their own cost.\n\nHowever, unlike other vaccinations which find a mention in the claim form submitted by mitanins as tasks on which they are incentivised, the Covid-19 inoculation is not listed.\n\n\u201cJust because I am not going to get money for it, I can\u2019t turn people down,\u201d Dhivar said.

We want money promised to us. The Congress government promised in their manifesto a minimum payment of Rs 5,000, we are not getting anywhere close to that,\u201d Dhivar said.\n\nWhile Chhattisgarh NHM Mission Director Priyanka Shukla did not respond to queries, Health Minister T S Singh Deo said, \u201cIn Emergency Covid-19 Response Plan, we got approval for three months, that is why we have made payment for two months and procedure for payment of third month is under process\u2026 The mitanins are one of the several grassroots workers who have been working relentlessly throughout the Covid-19 situation.

Scientist V K Saraswat, former head of Defence Research and Development Organisation and now a member of the NITI Aayog, called the decision \u201cretrograde\u201d and a \u201cstep in the wrong direction\u201d.\n\nVijayRaghavan and Saraswat have undergraduate degrees in engineering from IIT Kanpur and Madhav Institute of Technology and Science in Gwalior respectively.\n\nLast week, AICTE, India\u2019s technical education regulator, tweaked the entry-level qualification for undergraduate engineering programmes making students who haven\u2019t studied either physics or mathematics (or both) in Classes 11 and 12 eligible for admission.\n\nUnder the new norms, a candidate is expected to have scored at least 45% in any three subjects out of a list of 14 \u2014 physics, mathematics, chemistry, computer science, electronics, information technology, biology, informatics practices, biotechnology, technical vocational subject, engineering graphics, business studies, and entrepreneurship.\n\nEarlier, an engineering aspirant should have passed high school with physics and mathematics as compulsory subjects.\n\nThe regulator has been defending the changes on the ground that they are in line with the new National Education Policy\u2019s multidisciplinary approach. AICTE chairman Anil Sahasrabuddhe said last week that the changes, which are not binding on institutes and colleges, will \u201copen a window of opportunity\u201d for students from diverse academic backgrounds to pursue engineering, especially branches like textile and biotechnology where, he argued, an advanced knowledge of physics and mathematics is not required and can be fulfilled with bridge courses in college.\n\nThe Principal Scientific Advisor, however, told The Indian Express that these \u201cflexibilities must be exercised with care\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere may be some areas of natural sciences and social sciences where a high-school knowledge of mathematics (or physics) may not be essential but even here a strong schooling in logic, quantitative approaches, mathematics and physics learned early is valuable.\n\n\u201cWhat is true for the natural and social sciences is, of course, true of engineering of every kind. For example, a high-quality biotechnology course without, at the least, a strong high-school level training in physics and mathematics to start with is difficult to progress through. A good course will require advanced methods in statistics, computer science, probability, the physics of motion, and of colloids, and so on,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the proposal to offer bridge courses to students, he said: \u201cIt will be the rare individual who comes in unschooled and reaches par through a bridging course. Rigour and depth in mathematics and physics comes easier early on. It will be wiser to reach a high-school level in these subjects before applying and wiser for colleges to require this, and not sort to bridging courses as the main route.\u201d\n\nSaraswat echoed this. \u201cAn engineering programme spans four years. A student with a background in physics and mathematics will have to study the bridge course for at least two semesters. Such a student (needing remedial courses) will be completely at loss in (B.Tech) class. How can you expect a student to learn the letters of the alphabet and appreciate poetry at the same time?\u201d he asked.\n\nSaraswat added, \u201cThere is a renewed focus on STEM. Even MBBS doctors are now using mathematics. You no longer argue that just because I am a biologist I do not need to know physics. This is a retrograde step.\u201d\n\nAccording to him, the only way AICTE\u2019s decision could work is if students from diverse academic backgrounds first spend a year studying the bridge course, before starting normal classes of the engineering programme. \u201cYou cannot attend the bridge course and normal classes simultaneously,\u201d he said.\n\nProfessor Guhan Jayaraman, head of the biotechnology department at IIT-Madras, said AICTE\u2019s proposal isn\u2019t exactly new. Many private universities, he said, are already admitting students without mathematics in high school to biotechnology programmes and claim to offer them bridge courses to cope in class.\n\n\u201cBut when the graduates of these colleges come to an IIT for Ph.D, we have seen that these students cannot use simple mathematical formulations to answer our questions. To give you an example, these students will not be able to calculate the number of infected people in a month based on the infection\u2019s R naught value. So it\u2019s not as if this (bridge course) model is really working,\u201d he told this newspaper.\n\nTV Mohandas Pai, chairman of Manipal Global Education that runs Manipal Academy of Higher Education, said the AICTE\u2019s move is good in case of B.Tech programmes that do not require an understanding of \u201chigh level of mathematics\u201d. He suggested the bridge courses should be completed before starting formal classes.\n\nKiran Mazumdar-Shaw, chairperson and managing director of Biocon Limited, said that the tweak can work for biotechnology. \u201cWithout a background in maths you can still pursue biotechnology, but you will end up limiting your opportunities.

Located in a marketplace in Calangute, a popular tourist destination, Kama Gizmos was shut down by the panchayat citing the lack of a trade license, with its sarpanch objecting to \u201csuch activities\u201d.\n\nWhile the panchayat claimed the shop could not be allowed to run without the license, Kama Gizmos partner Prawin Ganeshan said the issues with the local authorities run deeper.\n\nCalangute Sarpanch Dinesh Simepuruskar said: \u201cWe had received oral complaints from many people about the shop and they did not have a trade license. So we have shut it down.\u201d The panchayat took action against the shop on Wednesday. Its signage was also removed.\n\n\u201cThey were selling sex-related things and we had received complaints from both men and women about it. People had also posted on social media and WhatsApp about the shop. Since it was in a gully everyone had not seen it before,\u201d said Simepuruskar. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to allow such activities.\u201d\n\nThe Kama Gizmos store in Goa was a joint venture between KamaKart, that runs a chain of ten sexual wellness stores in South India, and Mumbai-based Gizmoswala.\n\n\u201cOur trade license application is under process but we were advised by the people working with the Panchayat that we can open the store and the license would be issued in a few days. On Saturday (March 13), the Panchayat told us not to open the shop for some days so we kept it closed. We were under a lot of pressure from the local authority. Since we are outsiders and not from Goa, we are an easy target,\u201d said Ganeshan, CEO of KamaKart.\n\nKamaKart has outlets in Chennai, Bengaluru, Kochi, Colombo and Kathmandu.\n\nGaneshan said: \u201cWe display no nudity in the store and there is no obscenity.\u201d He said leaflets were distributed near the beach as part of a marketing outreach, and that some people who got them seemed to dislike the idea.\n\n\u201cWe have encountered no problems in any other city that we have shops in and we will not back down. We are selling completely legal products that are for pleasure and protection. We will restart in Goa within another month. We have conceptualised a sexual wellness store with doctor consultation,\u201d said Ganeshan.\n\nIn a month, the store with its white walls and products stacked neatly on shelves attracted customers including both men and women, according to Ganeshan.

At the same time, he said, the government will approach carmakers to consider a five per cent discount on purchase of new vehicles for those who give up their old vehicles for scrap \u2014 and push for relief in GST.\n\nAnnouncing the \u201cVoluntary Vehicle-Fleet Modernisation Programme\u201d in Lok Sabha on Thursday, Gadkari said that commercial vehicles over 15 years old and personal vehicles over 20 years old will be marked for scrapping if they fail to pass the test. \u201cThey will be seized and destroyed,\u201d he said.\n\nVehicle Scrappage will reduce our dependency on imports and help us to control the cost of materials. pic.twitter.com/sKHeF9Cruy \u2014 Office Of Nitin Gadkari (@OfficeOfNG) March 18, 2021\n\nThe emphasis of the policy is on de-registration of unfit vehicles by terming them \u201cend of life\u201d while incentivising an enabling environment for such vehicles to be then given up for the scrapping process.\n\nThe new regulatory regime, aimed primarily at cleaner emissions, fuel efficiency and better safety, will start mandatory testing of heavy commercial vehicles from April 2023 and for other categories, in a phased manner, from June 2024.\n\nIt will kick in earlier, from April 2022, for vehicles owned by governments and allied entities like PSUs. In their case, Gadkari said, vehicles over 15 years of age will be mandatorily scrapped, without any consideration of fitness \u2014 there are at least 2.37 lakh such vehicles, he said.\n\nExplained | How India plans on weeding out her older fleet of vehicles\n\nVintage cars will be exempted from this policy, Gadkari said, adding that separate guidelines will be formulated to regulate them.\n\n\u201cThe ecosystem is expected to attract additional investments of around Rs 10,000 crore and 35,000 job opportunities,\u201d the Minister said, adding that the new regime has been adopted after studying similar efforts in countries like Germany, UK, USA and Japan.\n\nAccording to the new policy, the Government will encourage the setting up of integrated scrapping facilities \u2014 Registered Vehicle Scrapping Facility (RVSF) \u2014 across India. Officials said the locations identified include Alang in Gujarat, where a highly specialised scrapping centre is planned.\n\nA key feature of the policy is a series of measures to nudge users towards the new system. \u201cAs a disincentive measure, increased fees for fitness certificate and fitness test may be applicable for commercial vehicles 15 year onwards from the date of initial registration,\u201d Gadkari said.\n\nIn a draft notification issued this week, the re-registration charges of all vehicles have been proposed to be hiked from eight to around 20 times depending on the type of vehicle. These charges will kick in from October this year.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ministry will issue advisories to carmakers to give a five per cent discount on new purchases after an old vehicle has been scrapped on the basis of a certificate. Gadkari is also pushing for a rebate in GST. \u201cI have requested the Finance Minister to give some rebate on GST of Centre and State. The decision is entirely theirs,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Centre has also advised states to give rebates of upto 25 per cent in road tax for newly purchased vehicles along with waiver of registration charges for those who produce scrappage certificates. Officials expect that the financial incentives of scrapping and buying a new car will far outweigh the running cost of, say, a 15-year-old personal vehicle. The Government expects the scrap value to be four-six per cent of the price of a new vehicle.\n\nGadkari said the new rules will apply in Delhi and the National Capital Region, too, where diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 are banned following a ruling in 2015 by the National Green Tribunal.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will take legal opinion on this matter on whether a law passed by Parliament will take precedence over the tribunal\u2019s judgement. In my opinion, it should. There are many such instances in the past. The basis of the scrapping policy is the amendments to the Motor Vehicles Act passed by Parliament. So this policy should be applicable on Delhi also,\u201d the Minister told reporters laters.\n\nGadkari said this policy is \u201cnot a penalty on anyone\u201d. \u201cThere is some talk, like what will the poor and the middle class do (after scrapping their car). So the thing is the new cars are better equipped with safety features and provide much better mileage. So it is a benefit for all,\u201d Gadkari told reporters. \u201cIt is not an anti-poor policy. Everybody stands to benefit from this.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday evening, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways issued a draft notification of rules for setting up an RVSF. Any legal entity can set up such a facility with a licence valid for 10 years and renewable for 10 more. The processing fee for applications is Rs 1 lakh each along with a bank guarantee of Rs 10 lakh. The centres will be linked to police and national databases to track stolen vehicles or those linked to other criminal activity.\n\nSimilarly, the Government plans Automated Fitness Centres to be set up through private participation. Officials said the aim is to have one every district, or at least 718 such centres across India.\n\nThe Ministry has sanctioned 26 model centres and requested states to allot land for free to encourage private investors. These automated centres, with no human intervention planned in the testing process, will charge around Rs 1,200 for testing, officials said.\n\nAccording to Ministry data, India has 51 lakh Light Motor Vehicles that are more than 20 years old and 34 lakh over 15 years old. Around 17 lakh Medium and Heavy Commercial Vehicles are older than 15 years without valid fitness certificates, according to the data."},

However, senior leaders like AICC general secretary Jitendra Singh and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel have since helped strengthen the organisational structure.\n\nThe Congress, which holds 19 seats in the outgoing Assembly, has allied with the AIUDF (14 seats) and the Bodoland People\u2019s Front (12 seats), along with other Left and regional parties.\n\nGogoi said they don\u2019t take the BJP\u2019s fear-mongering over the AIUDF seriously. \u201cThat (polarisation) is the BJP\u2019s usual way of running away from real issues.\u201d\n\nGogoi said his father had pushed for the alliance with the AIUDF and other like-minded parties early last year during the Rajya Sabha elections. \u201cFor the people, when we officially announced the alliance in January, it was already a fait accompli\u2026 In post-CAA Assam, the people want all parties opposed to the Act to be united.\u201d\n\nAlso Read | Idea of Assam\n\nBordoloi said the BJP \u201cwill communalise because they have nothing else to say\u201d.\n\nThe Congress has announced five guarantees for Assam if it comes to power \u2014 a law that nullifies the CAA, five lakh government jobs, raising tea workers\u2019 wages to Rs 365, free electricity up to 200 units per household, and Rs 2,000 monthly income support to homemakers. However, influential Congress leaders are yet to make their presence felt.\n\nEarlier this month, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited tea gardens in Assam. The backward tea tribes \u2014 comprising 17% of the state\u2019s population \u2014 hold influence in almost 40 seats.\n\nBordoloi said their campaign strategy was different from the BJP\u2019s. \u201cThey are spending a lot of money, the administration is with them\u2026 But we are focusing on the grassroots.\u201d\n\nAsked why he was not contesting from his father\u2019s constituency, Gogoi said, \u201cIt was my father\u2019s decision.

But vaccine wastage is not happening merely because people don\u2019t turn up and the vial is open. Even in situations where the required number of people are available, if vaccinators are not properly trained, they end up drawing maybe only nine doses against ten,\u201d sources said.\n\nAt the same time, officials said, well-trained vaccinators in a few centres are drawing more than 10 doses from a vial. \u201cThe trained vaccinators will tell you that even in a vial of ten doses, you can actually take out eleven. This is a crucial aspect to reduce vaccine wastage,\u201d an official said.\n\nDaily briefing | The stories you need to start your day with\n\nThe second reason, sources said, is the lack of planning at vaccination sites. According to operational guidelines, each vaccination session is expected to cater to a maximum of 100 beneficiaries. However, in remote and sparsely populated areas, states can organise sessions for a lesser number of beneficiaries while ensuring that there is no vaccine wastage. \u201cIf the number of beneficiaries at a session is less, it is clubbed with other sessions,\u201d the guidelines state.\n\n\u201cWe are continuously telling states to mobilise people and not open the vial if they don\u2019t have 10 beneficiaries. We have advised the states to ask beneficiaries to wait for half an hour or so\u2026if no one turns up, then we have asked the states to give the available beneficiaries the option of coming the next day. All of these come down to granular planning at the vaccination centre level,\u201d sources said.\n\nAccording to them, UP, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have communicated that \u201cextensive granular planning\u201d will be undertaken. \u201cDuring the interaction, the states said they cannot afford to turn beneficiaries away as this could lead to vaccine hesitancy. However, at the same time, they have said they will do rigorous granular planning and train vaccinators to ensure lower wastage,\u201d sources said.\n\n\u201cBut we should also keep in mind that when India started vaccinating in January, our national average of vaccine wastage in the first two weeks was around 18-19 per cent,\u201d sources said.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the larger states where wastage is less than the national average are: Rajasthan (5.6 percent), Assam (5.5 per cent), Gujarat (5.3 per cent), West Bengal (4.8 per cent), Bihar (4 per cent) and Tamil Nadu (3.7 per cent).\n\nOn Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had directed states to examine reasons for the wastage and ensure \u201ca mechanism where every evening this is being monitored\u201d. \u201c\u2026by wasting the doses of vaccine, we are denying another beneficiary the right to get vaccinated.

However, we feel that it is time to bury the past and move forward,\u201d the Pakistan Army chief said, qualifying that \u201cfor resumption of peace process or meaningful dialogue, our neighbour will have to create conducive environment, particularly in [Kashmir].\u201d\n\nStable India-Pakistan relations, he said, was \u201ca key to unlock the untapped potential of South and Central Asia by ensuring connectivity between East and West Asia\u201d, but this potential had been hostage to disputes and issues between the two \u201cnuclear armed\u201d neighbours, with Kashmir at the top of the list of problems.\n\nOn Wednesday, speaking on the first day of the same event, Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has often said that his government and the Army are \u201con the same page\u201d, also projected a vision of connectivity and economic prosperity for the region, but said Kashmir remained the \u201cbiggest hurdle between the two countries\u201d.\n\nPakistan had made all efforts for better ties with India, PM Khan said, and now \u201cIndia will have to take the first step. Unless they do so, we cannot do much\u201d.\n\nExplained Pak buffeted by multiple crises, signalling change of position Bajwa has said it is a rational choice to see the region in terms of geo-economic integration rather than geo-strategic rivalries. Pakistan is grappling with questions of economic survival in the post-Covid world, alongside the threat of blacklisting by FATF. India has much to gain if this shift is for real.\n\nHe also referred to the UNSC resolutions, saying \u201cIf India gives the Kashmiris their right under the UN, it will be greatly beneficial for Pakistan as well as India.\u201d\n\nEven so, this is a big change in Pakistan\u2019s earlier position that India must reverse its August 5, 2019 \u201cannexation\u201d of Kashmir for any meaningful dialogue between the two countries.\n\nThere has been no official response from India on the remarks by Gen Bajwa or Prime Minister Khan. However, Bajwa\u2019s speech, which was notable for the absence of any references on Kashmir that were likely to be panned by New Delhi, came against the backdrop of the February 25 agreement between the two sides for \u201cstrict observance\u201d of the 2003 understanding for a ceasefire at the Line of Control and the International Border, and may be an indication of the broad intended direction of this detente.\n\nThe Director Generals of Military Operations of the two sides, who were the signatories of the joint statement on the ceasefire, had \u201cagreed to address each other\u2019s core issues and concerns which have propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence\u201d. Since then, no incidents of cross-LoC or cross-border firing have taken place.\n\nWhile the ceasefire has provided long-awaited relief to the armies and civilians on both sides of the LoC, both have also tamped down bigger expectations from the ceasefire.\n\nOn the Indian side, officials have stressed that any wider relaxation of bilateral tensions would take place only if Pakistan created an \u201cenvironment free of terror and hostility\u201d.\n\nTop sources in the Pakistani security establishment had told The Indian Express earlier this month that the ceasefire agreement was only a \u201ctactical\u201d response to the situation at the LoC, as the cross firing was causing a high number of civilian deaths. Anything more would depend on India taking the first step, which the sources said, should be the restoration of statehood in Kashmir as a \u201cstarting point\u201d for a dialogue.\n\nAt a strategic level, faced with a huge economic crisis that has only got worse due to the Covid-19 epidemic, and amid a geopolitical flux in West Asia, humiliating demands from even friendly nations to return their loans, Pakistan has been signalling to the world that it is rethinking its national security model.\n\n\u201cPakistan is decidedly on an economic security paradigm now, and this is a shift. There is whole framework behind it, with the entire national security conception built around economic security at its core, and that then benefiting human welfare and military security,\u201d said a key Pakistani source, familiar with the deliberations on this issue.\n\nThe central theme of this new model is Pakistan\u2019s \u201ceconomic location\u201d, the source said, and the connectivity between east and west that Pakistan can offer and, linked to that, \u201cdevelopment partnerships \u2013 no more assistance from the world, but co-investment opportunities, of which CPEC is an example, but not the only one\u201d.\n\nFor instance, as Imran Khan pointed out on Wednesday, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan have recently signed a roadmap agreement for a 573-km train line from Tashkent to Peshawar via Kabul.\n\nBajwa appeared to speak in this vein as he talked of Pakistan as a nation with \u201ctremendous geo-economic potential\u201d and listed \u201cthe four pillars\u201d of Pakistan\u2019s new national security \u201cparadigm\u201d: moving towards lasting peace within and outside; non-interference in internal affairs of neighbouring and regional countries; boosting intra-regional trade and connectivity; bringing sustainable development and prosperity through establishment of investment and economic hubs in the region.\n\nOutlining a vision of regional economic integration through the revival of SAARC and a peaceful Afghanistan, he said Pakistan\u2019s efforts towards these objectives, along with its \u201cresponsible and mature behaviour in crisis situations with India, manifest our desire to change the narrative of geo-political contestation into geo-economic integration\u201d.\n\nHe also seemed to be offering the reassurance that Pakistan\u2019s strategic and economic partnership with China, while being central to its new framework of national security, was not the limit of this vision.\n\n\u201c[O]nly seeing Pakistan through CPEC vision is also misleading,\u201d he said, describing Pakistan as a country of immense and diverse potential which can very positively contribute to regional development and prosperity\u201d."},

The cremation ruling was rescinded later.\n\n\u201cThe UUCSA will once again appeal to the Department of International Relations and Co-operation to engage with its counterparts to stop state-sanctioned Islamophobia,\u201d Yusuf Patel, the secretary-general of UUCSA, told the weekly Post.\n\n\u201cMuslims in Sri Lanka have become targets of virulent hate speech in mainstream and social media. The ban on the burqa and the closure of schools are meant to appease Sri Lanka\u2019s Buddhist majority, who thrive on entrenching sectarian and religious divides through hate propaganda,\u201d Patel said.\n\nAdding its voice to the call for action against Sri Lanka, the South African Muslim Network (Samnet) said it was hypocritical of the Sri Lankan government to target Islamic schools.\n\n\u201cThere are other religious groups who also have institutions that teach their religious teachings, but there has been no attempt to target those,\u201d Samnet chairperson Dr Faisal Suliman told the weekly.\n\n\u201cSuch moves like this, on the Muslim community, will likely give rise to radicalism, fundamentalism and underground movements, which will in fact be a greater source of insecurity than working with religious schools, interacting with them and looking at the syllabi taught. By doing this, they will be ensuring that there are standards and uniformity of the teachings.\u201d\n\nSuliman said Samnet would express its concerns to both the local foreign ministry as well as the Sri Lankan embassy in South Africa."},

Among other announcements, Gehlot increased the MLA LAD fund to Rs 5 crore annually from the current Rs 2.25 crore. (Express Photo)\n\nChief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday announced that his government\u2019s much anticipated Universal Health Scheme (UHS) will be launched on May 1 this year.\n\nIn his reply to the budget debate in the Assembly, Gehlot said that it will be named Mukhyamantri Chiranjeevi Yojana. In his budget speech on February 24, Gehlot had announced UHS with Rs 3,500 crore in the upcoming financial year wherein cashless health services up to Rs 5 lakh will be provided to all families in the state. Gehlot said that registration for those not included in the National Food Security Act (NFSA)/Socio Economic Caste Census (SECC) beneficiary list will begin from April 1.\n\nIn another important announcement, Gehlot increased the MLA Local Area Development (MLA LAD) fund from Rs 2.25 crore to Rs 5 crore annually, following demand by both Congress and Opposition MLAs. The announcement was welcomed by MLAs across party lines by tapping their tables. The CM, however, did not state when will this be implemented.\n\nEarlier, at the beginning of his speech and in a reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi paying tributes to Mahatma Gandhi recently, Gehlot said, \u201cIt is a good opportunity for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to talk to (RSS chief) Mohan Bhagwat and make such an environment \u2014 forget what happened in six years \u2014 there should be a new beginning in the country with harmony, love, brotherhood.\u201d\n\n\n\nGehlot then attacked Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria, who had spoken just before the CM, for \u201cmisleading\u201d the House. \u201cThe way you speak, it sounds as if you only speak the truth, and nothing but the truth. But it isn\u2019t so. You know how to speak lies in a way that it sounds truthful. And I have told you, in private too, don\u2019t get angry. While speaking well and using such good words, you suddenly shift to \u2018tu, ta\u2019. It is a topic of research what emotion takes over you. Come to my office or residence, I will clear all your doubts, but don\u2019t mislead the House,\u201d Gehlot said.\n\nHe said that the Opposition misled and \u201cstole the headlines in newspapers, (you said) that in 2.5 years, 1.8 lakh jobs were announced but only 13,000 were given employment.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo far, we have given appointments in 97,000 jobs, while exams have been held/results declared for about 17,000 jobs and they will be given appointments soon. For another 37,000 posts, the advertisements have been issued and the exams will be conducted soon. For another 23,000, the process to issue advertisements is underway. This way, we are in the process of providing over 1.7 lakh jobs in just 2-2.25 years, and despite coronavirus,\u201d the CM said.\n\nHe claimed that when the Centre is now receiving \u201cthe same revenue as 2019-20, then it is beyond understanding why you are decreasing the state\u2019s share. Rajasthan\u2019s share has decreased by 17 per cent. In 2019-20 we received Rs 10,000 crore less, Rs 14,000 crore less in 2020-21, and for 2021-22, we have already been told that we will receive Rs 12,000 crore less: this totals to Rs 36,000 crore,\u201d Gehlot said.\n\n\u201cThe PM talks of cooperative federalism, but only talks about and doesn\u2019t bring it in practice. The circumstances in the country are worrying,\u201d Gehlot said.\n\nWhile he did not speak on the phone tapping issue, Gehlot said one should \u201ctalk on WhatsApp or FaceTime, else your phones may be tapped.\u201d Referring to the debate on phone tapping, he joked, \u201cyesterday, all your phones were tapped.\u201d\n\nWith Kataria focusing on the state\u2019s financial health, Gehlot said that whenever BJP is in power, its financial management is \u201cbakwaas (rubbish). You may have vision but no financial management\u2026In the House, we should talk where the parameters are headed, and criticism within that is justified.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the last 10-12 years, there has been Revenue Surplus thrice, and every time it was during our tenure: 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13. And in your time, there was a Revenue Deficit of Rs 3,215 crore, then Rs 15,954 crore in 2015-16, Rs 18,114 crore in 2016-17, Rs 18,534 crore in 2017-18 and Rs 28,900 crore in 2018-19,\u201d he said. He said that the state\u2019s Debt-to-GDP ratio was 36.38 per cent when he assumed power in 2008-09, \u201cWe reduced it to 23.58 per cent when we handed over the government to you (in 2013-14). But you again took it to 33.78 per cent. Now it is continuously increasing in our tenure due to the factors I listed \u2013 Centre\u2019s devolution, GST, and the debts you gave to us when we assumed charge.\u201d He said that similarly, Fiscal Deficit has been high under BJP.\n\n\u201cIn your time, Fiscal Deficit has always gone above 3 per cent: 3.09, 9.25, 6.09, 3.06 and 3.74 while, with us, it was 3.87 when we took charge from you, then 1.22, 0.83, 1.73 and 2.76.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cThese are the parameters which tell financial discipline,\u201d and said that the state\u2019s figures have been better than the Centre\u2019s.\n\nAmong other announcements, the CM announced a Back-to-Work scheme where 15,000 women will be covered in the next three years. Under the scheme, efforts will be made via the private sector to provide work from home job opportunities to trained women professionals and working women who left work to take care of family after marriage."},

This could peak to Rs 1.23 lakh crore later, with the backstop being triggered only in the event of a pandemic and if the payouts exceed capacity. While thousands of small units shut down after lockdown was imposed in March 2020, many of them are yet to stage a comeback.\n\nThe first phase would cover income losses due to non-damage business interruption caused by a future pandemic and subsequent lockdown for up to 10 employees per enterprise \u2014 with maximum reimbursement of Rs 6,500 per employee per month for three months or easing of a lockdown, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe Covid pandemic is unlikely to be covered by the pool. As pandemic losses are currently covered under health insurance products, a future outbreak may be covered under the pool in the second phase. In later phases, the coverage may be expanded to the life insurance segment. The pool premium collection is proposed to be invested in government securities or specifically designed bonds by the government. Under the pandemic pool plan, insurance firms \u2014 with or without support from governments \u2014 come together and contribute money to form the pool and provide protection for payouts to people and companies in the wake of a pandemic.\n\nMeanwhile, after recording a big rise in health insurance sales, insurers, mainly public sector companies, have seen a dip in new premium collection in the month of February. While PSU insurers have recorded a 13.75 per cent decline in premium collection in February 2021 to Rs 1,811 crore, the overall premium income, including private insurers, has fallen by 0.94 per cent to Rs 4,384 crore in February 2020, according to data released by IRDAI.\n\nHowever, the overall premium collection for the 11 months ended February 2021 has gone up by 13.06 per cent to Rs 52,884. This is mainly because demand for health insurance policies shot up since March 2020 in the wake of the spike in Covid cases. Health premium collection by private insurers increased by 14.19 per cent to Rs 27,698 crore during the 11-month period.\n\nMany health insurers had increased the premium on health policies by 100 per cent recently in the wake of a rise in new premium income and claims. With insurance companies arbitrarily jacking up premiums by up to 100 per cent on health insurance policies, insurance regulator IRDAI has stepped in and asked insurers to desist from unilaterally hiking premiums after making small changes in the policy.\n\n\u201cGeneral and health insurers are not allowed to modify the existing benefits, add new benefits in the existing products which leads to imposing an increase in premium,\u201d IRDAI said in a notification to insurers."},

According to Clause (2) of the Article, \u201cParliament may by law include in or exclude from the Central List of socially and educationally backward classes specified in a notification issued under clause (1) any socially and educationally backward class\u201d.\n\nThe Attorney General drew the court\u2019s attention to the 1992 judgment of a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court in the Indra Sawhney case and said it requires the Centre as well as states to set up commissions to identify backward classes.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen a specific direction is issued by a nine-judge bench, and the government shows every indication to implement it, is it conceivable that an amendment to the Constitution will be made, by which states are denuded of the right to identify backward classes?\u201d, said Venugopal. \u201cAccording to me, it is inconceivable that any such amendment would be brought into force, the effect of which would be that no state would be having the power to identify SEBC.\u201d\n\nHe said no changes have been made which impacts the power of states to grant reservation under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution. Article 342A does not touch the power of the state, he said. To construe it as excluding states from exercising power is not justified because there is no attempt to modify Articles 15(4) and 16(4), which declare that power to identify backward classes lies both with the state and Centre, he added.\n\nVenugopal submitted that there can be a central and state list of SEBC and the Centre would only use its list for employment in services under it. \u201cThere are PSUs in the Government of India. Even offices of the Centre in states where there is the employment of the public servants of the Union\u2026. There are also institutions such as IITs and IIMs in these cases, Union won\u2019t take lists made by states,\u201d he said."},

In it, state Congress chief Ripun Bora is purportedly heard whispering to MP Gaurav Gogoi at a public event: \u201cGaurav, whatever happens later, politics is politics, let\u2019s just make a few announcements today like loan waiver\u2026\u201d\n\nHitting out at the party over the video, Modi said that this was how the Congress functioned: By just making announcements.\n\n\u201cThese people are cut off from the ground realities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cCongress ruled for years, their corruption and vote bank politics have made Assam one of the most disconnected states,\u201d Modi said, adding that the BJP-led governments were correcting the mistakes of decades of Congress rule.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress Thursday posed a set of questions to PM Modi, alleging that big announcements made by him for Assam have translated to a \u201cbig zero\u201d.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Guwahati, All India Congress Committee general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala said: \u201cThe first question is about Modi\u2019s fake promise in the world\u2019s largest river island Majuli, where he had given a speech on March 26, 2016 and promised to build a bridge over the Brahmaputra. Today, we want to ask why there was no development related to it.\n\n\u201cNow, on the eve of the Assam Assembly poll, why are they speaking lies, performing \u2018bhoomi poojan\u2019 of the bridge from Majuli to Jorhat, entailing a cost of Rs 925.47 crore?\u201d Sujewala said.\n\nIn 2017, the BJP had announced that a 1,300-km expressway will be built on both banks of the Brahmaputra for Rs 40,000 crore, the senior Congress leader said. \u201cBut on February 8, 2021, the Rajya Sabha was informed that there was no proposal to build an expressway in Assam. Why have you cheated the people of Assam?\u201d\n\nSujewala alleged a conspiracy to eliminate the identity of Assam with the introduction of the contentious CAA. \u201cWhy do you want to harm the indigenous culture and civilisation of Assam? Modi promised to implement CAA in West Bengal. On the other hand, they said their government will not implement CAA in Tamil Nadu, but he is silent in Assam. Why is this double standard?\u201d he said. \u2014WITH PTI INPUTS"},

But it has stepped up its recovery process.\n\nOne year since the Covid-19 pandemic began, a new report released on Thursday showed that nine of the countries (including India) with the most tuberculosis (TB) cases \u2014representing 60% of the global TB burden \u2014 saw a drastic decline in diagnosis and treatment of TB infections in 2020, ranging from 16% to 41% (with an average of 23%).\n\nThe drop brought the overall number of people diagnosed and treated for TB in those countries to 2008 levels, a setback of 12 years, but India has still made a good recovery, Dr Lucica Ditiu, executive director of the Stop TB Partnership, a United Nations-hosted entity based in Geneva, Switzerland, told media persons at a virtual conference after releasing the report on Thursday.\n\nIndia was one of the first countries where the dramatic decline in TB notifications (70% decline between weeks 10 and 15 of 2020) was noticed as an impact of Covid-19 pandemic. But it has stepped up its recovery process.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, over 6.3 lakh TB patients were tested for Covid-19 and more than 5,000 had both Covid-19 and TB. \u201cWe have spent $ 137 million dollars as nutritional support to TB patients in India in the last three years,\u201d Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Dr Harsh Vardhan said while responding to a query from The Indian Express at an online conference.\n\nOverall in India in 2020, TB notification was down by 25 per cent but month wise data shows that TB notifications gradually picked up later and by December 2020, TB notification was back to December 2019 level, said an official from the Central TB division, Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.\n\nNo country has a higher TB burden than India which accounts for a quarter of the 10 million global TB cases and 1.4 million TB deaths each year.\n\nThe findings released on Thursday were determined by looking at the diagnosis and treatment statistics for Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Philippines, South Africa, Tajikistan, and Ukraine \u2013 nine countries that together represent 60% of the global TB burden \u2013 and comparing data from 2020 with 2019.\n\nIn these countries, TB diagnosis and enrolment on treatment in 2020 declined by a total of 1 million, ranging from 16% to 41% (an average of 23%) in individual countries,\n\nIn addition to the worldwide drop in TB diagnosis and treatment, data emerging from India and South Africa shows that people coinfected with TB and Covid-19 have three times higher mortality than people infected with TB alone. This makes contact tracing, case finding and bi-directional TB and Covid-19 testing essential, the report has said.\n\nDr Harsh Vardhan, while addressing the conference, said to mitigate the Covid-19 pandemic on TB services , bi-directional screening of TB and Covid-19 took place in people displaying influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections. \u201cAt least 24 per cent of TB patients knew Covid-19 status in 2020,\u201d said Dr Harsh Vardhan.\n\nTB is top priority and a mass movement `TB Mukt Bharat\u2019 has been launched to end the disease by 2025, Dr Harsh Vardhan said.\n\n\u201cOne rapid molecular diagnostic facility has been set up in each district and plans are underway to decentralise to block level, including introducing newer drugs for effective treatment of drug resistant TB,\u201d said Dr Harsh Vardhan.\n\nA rapid response plan was developed by August 2020. Efforts to locate TB and Covid-19 cases in all healthcare facilities intensified, and rapid molecular testing for TB expanded. Contact tracing systems and testing for TB linked to Covid-19 contact tracing were quickly set up. Private-sector TB care facilities were reopened, and digital tools were rolled out to help people with TB stick to treatment regimens, among other measures, said Dr Harsh Vardhan.\n\nSince March 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic has severely disrupted TB responses in low-and middle-income countries, stalling and reversing years of progress made against TB.\n\nIn May 2020, a modelling study conducted by the Stop TB Partnership in collaboration with Imperial College, Avenir Health, Johns Hopkins and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) predicted the impact of Covid-19 related measures on TB. It showed that globally, a three-month lockdown followed by a protracted 10-month restoration could lead to an additional 6.3 million cases of TB between 2020 and 2025 and an additional 1.4 million TB deaths during this time.\n\nThis suggested that global TB incidence and deaths in 2021 could increase to levels last seen between 2013 and 2016, respectively \u2013 implying a setback of at least 5 to 8 years in the fight against TB. In March 2021, data from several countries showed that the impact on TB diagnosis and treatment happened as was assumed in the modelling.\n\n\n\nHowever, the recovery has taken longer than expected, and as of March 2021, it is not complete in most high TB burden countries."},

It also found that women have been hit particularly hard in terms of job losses.\n\nThe survey, prepared jointly by the Delhi Directorate of Economics and Statistics and the Centre for Market Research and Social Development, also includes separate sections listing a series of recommendations and \u201cpotential policy responses\u201d to address unemployment challenges.\n\nThe proposal on the jobs guarantee scheme finds mention as a recommendation as well as in the segment on the \u201cpotential policy responses\u201d section, where the report touches upon the steps taken or being considered by the government to tackle the issue.\n\nIt says the government is planning to launch a scheme to provide guaranteed jobs for a few months in a year at minimum wages of Rs 569 per day to one adult member of a household in Delhi. \u201cDelhi government\u2019s plan to implement the guaranteed jobs scheme to help those facing difficulty in finding work must be introduced immediately since majority of the respondents have shown their interest to get job under this scheme. This will definitely benefit unemployed persons of Delhi who lost employment during Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d the report states.\n\nIt adds that such jobs would not be permanent in nature or entitle the beneficiaries to any pension. To be sure, the Delhi government has not made any allocation for this proposed scheme in its Rs 69,000 crore annual budget for the year 2021-22 presented last week.\n\nEconomist Jean Dreze, one of the architects of the National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme, had last September proposed that an urban jobs guarantee scheme should be considered to help people tide over the widespread lockdown-induced distress.\n\nThe survey, which had a sample size of 44,226 of which 32,052 people were aged 15 and above, also sought to gauge the potential demand for such a scheme among the people and found there are many takers for it. The sample size had representations from all the 11 districts of the national capital.\n\nIt found that 73% unemployed people were keen to register under the proposed scheme. Asked about the type of job they would like to sign up for, most preferred among men was construction work and plantation, while in the case of women, most picked provisioning of care for children and construction work, says the report.\n\nThe preferred choices of jobs are in line with another crucial finding of the survey that \u201cthe unemployment rate increased more among the illiterates and less educated both in males and females compared to the more educated males and females\u201d.\n\nApart from construction work (31%) and child care (13%), there\u2019s demand for openings in the areas of driving, teaching, electrician, beautician, tailoring, cooking (20%) as well, the report notes.\n\nIt stresses that the implementation of the proposed scheme is \u201cvery much needed to revive the economy of Delhi which was deeply affected by corona\u201d."},

If the central government allows vaccination for all, and if we get a sufficient supply of the vaccine that is to be administered, we have formulated a plan to administer the vaccine to the entire Delhi in the next three months. I want to appeal to the central government to decentralise the system, have less control over it, and allow the state governments to administer the vaccine on a war-footing,\u201d he said during an online address.\n\nThe CM met health department officials Thursday to assess the sudden increase in cases in Delhi. The city has seen a slow increase over the past two weeks. While two weeks ago, the city was seeing an average of around 150 cases a day, the number has increased considerably and 607 cases were reported on Thursday. The increase, however, is not as sharp as it is in states like Maharashtra and Punjab.\n\n\n\nRequesting a simpler vaccination process, Kejriwal said, \u201cI also appeal to the Centre to provide some relaxation in the vaccination guidelines since it is coming as a barrier in the efficient functioning of vaccination centres. We now have two months\u2019 worth of experience in the process\u2026 We assure them that we will be careful, but if the central government agrees to provide certain relaxations, it will help us in opening new centres. Many of the existing centres are functioning for 24 hours, we will instruct more centres to function for 24 hours,\u201d he said.\n\nKejriwal also said the Centre should come out with a category of ineligible persons instead of those who are eligible: \u201cThe current guidelines are very rigid.

Instead, the funds collected under the BOCW Welfare Fund could have been used for direct cash transfers to the workers,\u201d the official told The Indian Express.\n\nReferring to issuance of tenders for supply of stainless steel utensils by the Maharashtra Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board under the state\u2019s Labour Department, the Central Advisory Board\u2019s Chairman V Srinivasa Naidu in a missive to the state late last month called for \u201cstopping the misuse\u201d of the BOCW funds and cancellation of tender process.\n\n\u201cI have received few representations bringing into my notice that the state BOC Workers Welfare Board of Maharashtra has invited tenders for supply of household kits to construction workers, which is in contravention of the orders of the Honourable Supreme Court.

He has over 500 movies to his credit as an actor and delivered blockbuster hits such as Assembly Rowdy (1991), Major Chandrakanth (1993), Pedarayudu (1995), etc under his Lakshmi Prasanna Pictures banner.\n\nMohan Babu made a solid mark across all genres and among theatre-goers with his peculiar dialogue delivery and diction. It is not an exaggeration to say that he owns a dedicated fanbase who will throng to the cinema halls to enjoy his voice modulations on the screen. On the occasion of his birthday, here we bring you a list of his best films.\n\nRayalaseema Ramanna Chowdary (2000)\n\nDirected by Suresh Krishna of Baashha fame, the movie presents Mohan Babu in the title role. The film is a super hit on television rather than in theatres. Each scene involving him in an aggressive avatar truly represents his versatility as an actor.\n\n\n\nPedarayudu (1995)\n\nDespite being the Telugu remake of Tamil hit Nattamai, this Ravi Raja Pinisetty directorial turned out to be an all-time hit in Tollywood, and over the years, emerged as a cult-hit among the Telugu audiences. The movie has Mohan Babu in the dual roles of Pedarayudu and Raja. Interestingly, Super Star Rajinikanth played the father to Mohan Babu in the movie. Mohan Babu\u2019s performance as a loyal son Pedarayudu to Paparayudu (Rajinikanth) continues to entertain fans.\n\nPunya Bhoomi Naa Desam (1994)\n\n\n\nIt is the Telugu remake of Nana Patekar\u2019s Krantiveer and remained an average grosser at the box office. However, the emotional depth displayed by Mohan Babu through his dialogues is an example of his acting prowess. That alone qualifies as a valid reason to watch the film.\n\n\n\nAssembly Rowdy (1991)\n\nAssembly Rowdy is the film that catapulted Mohan Babu to superstardom. It is also the project that made him the Dialogue King among the audience. The dialogue \u201cAristhe Charustha, Charisthe Karustha, Karisthe\u2026\u201d still trends among the Telugu people. That is the kind of impact the film had on the public.\n\n\n\nKodama Simham (1990)\n\nKodama Simham is a Chiranjeevi film, and Mohan Babu played the antagonist named Sudigali with a satirical touch. His antics and comedy-filled dialogues became the talk of the town after the film\u2019s release.

Sound sleep benefits the body overall and helps in repairing damaged cells and the immune system.\n\n\u201cWhile some people lack sleep due to their schedules or work, there are also those who suffer from what is called sleep disorders. It is alarming to note that not many people take these seriously and are, therefore, also prone to other health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. One such common sleep disorder is Sleep Apnoea, said Dr Vishal Sehgal, Medical Director, Portea Medical.\n\nThere are typically three types of sleep apnoea that one needs to be aware of:\n\nObstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA): This is the most prevalent form of the problem wherein throat muscles tend to relax.\n\nCentral Sleep Apnea: This is a condition when the brain signals to the muscles that control breathing become irregular.\n\nComplex Sleep Apnea Syndrome: This is a complicated and treatment-emergent situation where the person is affected with both Obstructive as well as Central Sleep Apnea.\n\n\u201cWhile Obstructive Sleep Apnea affects both genders, it is typically believed that men are more prone to it. The 8:1 ratio of men vs women is probably the cause behind it. However, there is a need for greater awareness about this problem as it poses several serious risks to one\u2019s health. It can cause heart ailments and even fatalities. Problems such as feeling fatigued even after waking up in the morning and snoring are the commonest manifestations of sleep apnoea,\u201d he told indianexpress.com.\n\nHe added that In 2017, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine conducted a study that discovered that men and women have different experiences of sleep apnoea. \u201cWhile the prevalence of the problem is more widespread among men, it is found to be more severe among women. The differences in symptoms of sleep apnoea among men and women are caused by their physiological differences influencing their body processes and the impact of various treatments on them,\u201d he added.\n\nA women-specific risk of sleep apnoea are the hormonal changes caused by menopause.

(Photo: Getty Images/Thinkstock)\n\nBelow, he highlights the differences:\n\nSleep apnoea symptoms in women\n\nThe symptoms of sleep apnoea are not that straightforward which can result in them remaining undiagnosed. Unlike men, women might not snore loudly enough to be noticed. However, they may show visible symptoms such as insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue. The lack of proper sleep causes discomfort in functions during the daytime. Other common symptoms among women are morning headaches and moodiness. Obesity and additional weight can also cause sleep apnoea as the former might narrow the airways and make it more difficult to breathe during sleep. Another women-specific risk of sleep apnoea is the hormonal changes caused by menopause which can alter breathing and airways. Women should therefore consult a specialist if they regularly feel exhausted or experience headaches.\n\nSleep apnoea symptoms in men\n\nFor men, the most visible and audible symptom of sleep apnoea is snoring. According to data available, roughly 34 million Indians suffer from obstructive sleep apnoea and the prevalence rate is at 14 per cent in men and 12 per cent in women. Male snoring is usually louder and more disturbing for others compared to female snoring. That\u2019s also the reason why men or their partners are often actively seeking a solution for snoring and eventually getting the OSA diagnosed.\n\nHowever, the OSA symptoms among women such as drowsiness, fatigue and weaker memory are often mistaken as causes of other issues and they don\u2019t get diagnosed. This lack of diagnosis or ignorance can lead to type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and hypertension in women. Sometimes, it can also cause further risks such as hypothyroidism, cognitive impairment, dementia, and depression.\n\nInadequate sleep can lead to various health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. (Photo: Getty Images/thinkstock) Inadequate sleep can lead to various health conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. (Photo: Getty Images/thinkstock)\n\nTreatment of OSA\n\nSince there are clear differences in symptoms among men and women, the treatment outcomes might also differ. However, not enough studies have been conducted so far to identify such variations in treatment response. It has been observed that the amount of airway pressure required for men and women might differ due to the physiological differences in the respiratory tract. Men need more airway pressure than women to keep the breathing running throughout the night.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nTimely identification of OSA is extremely important. Lack of proper sleep can be detrimental to the body\u2019s growth and recovery from illnesses as well as its smooth functioning. This holds equally true for both genders. If you are experiencing any of the mentioned symptoms, it is imperative to consult a doctor and get your sleep apnoea treated."},

(Photo: Pixabay)\n\nSleep plays an essential part in maintaining one\u2019s overall health. Sleep deprivation can result in cases of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, along with stress and anxiety.\n\nBut, did you know that there is a biological variation when it comes to how sleep affects both men and women? The vicious cycle of sleeping less and performing minimal physical activity has dangerous consequences, especially for women. \u201cThat is because women have more hormonal changes throughout their lifespan, said Dr Sibasish Dey, head, medical affairs, Asia and Latin America, ResMed\n\n\u201cAccording to many studies, women need about 30 minutes of more sleep than men because of the hormonal changes due to their monthly menstrual cycle and menopause. Estrogen and progesterone \u2014 the two major female sex hormones \u2014 can influence the brain\u2019s chemical systems that regulate sleep and arousal,\u201d added Dr Dey.\n\nSleep deprivation may also lead to fatigue and mood swings, especially among women suffering from PCOS \u2013 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. (Source: gettyimages/file) (Source: gettyimages/file)\n\nConsequences of a poor sleep cycle for women\n\nIn a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, women often face more challenges in concentrating than men. This is further exacerbated by sleep deprivation. Dr Dey adds, \u201cit can also aggravate pre-existing mood disturbances, such as anger, depression, and anxiety, and can lead to confusion, fatigue, and lack of vigour, ultimately impacting productivity.\u201d\n\nNot only that it can also affect fertility, as Dr Dey piint out, \u201cLong term lack of sleep may directly affect the release of luteinizing hormone, or LH \u2014 the hormone that triggers ovulation to regulate the menstrual cycle and affect fertility.\u201d\n\nWhat should women do to get more sleep?\n\nGood sleep has proven effects in improving women\u2019s physical and mental health. It also leads to better functioning of the circulatory system. Improved collagen production during sleep also delays the onset of wrinkles.\n\nHere are a few tips by Dr Dey to have a healthy sleep regime:\n\nTry maintaining a healthy circadian rhythm. \u201cTry to sleep between 10 pm \u2013 7 am, and make sure you are getting at least seven hours of restful sleep regularly.\u201d\n\nStop consuming caffeine at least five hours before bedtime\n\nA hot water shower can help you sleep better.\n\nRead a book or practice meditation in order to help your mind relax.\n\nREAD | Common sleep disorders you should not ignore\n\nWhile everyone experiences a lousy night of sleep once in a while, but if you are experiencing sleepless nights regularly along with symptoms such as morning headaches, daytime sleepiness, and loss in productivity, it\u2019s time you consult a sleep specialist.\n\nFor more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"},
