While these numbers are dependent on how frequently and accurately hospital staff updates them, HT\u2019s monitoring of the Delhi Corona website showed vacanacies at hospitals have significantly dropped in the past two days.In the case of ICU beds, there was a peak of 34 vacancies that was reported on Wednesday morning before the number dropped soon after. For most of Thursday, there were fewer than The number of vacant beds has followed a clearer fall, dropping from roughly 2,700 available on Tuesday evening to a little over 2,100 late on Thursday.As on Thursday, there were 91,618 active cases in Delhi \u2013 the first time this number was above the 90,000 mark. The city added 26,169 new cases in the past 24 hours and recorded 306 more fatalities.Experts say the numbers capture a crisis that has been unfolding for several weeks now and could drive up mortality as lives that can be saved with medical attention are lost.\u201cThe situation in Delhi is very bad; it is turning out to be a Brazil-like situation. People are going from hospital to hospital for the want of beds. When hospitals are full and we can\u2019t take care of patients, the number of deaths will go up. I believe they have set up a system in Maharashtra where a centralised helpline takes patients information such as name, age, oxygen saturation, reports of X-ray or CT scans and direct people to hospitals accordingly. There should be a similar system in Delhi,\u201d said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.A doctor from one of Delhi\u2019s big private hospitals, which is finding it difficult to refer patients out of its emergency department, too, said a centralised system was needed to cut down on the number of deaths.\u201cEvery day there are patients who are brought dead to our emergency department. They have been going from hospital to hospital looking for beds. We lose patients because they are lying on the floor instead of the ICU they need. We have more patients than we have oxygen points. A solution would be for the government to take stock of the number of beds across the city and refer patients wherever beds are available. Hospitals such as the one built by the army should be meant for such referral patients,\u201d the doctor said, asking not to be named.\u201cSo far, there was hardly any difference in the mortality during this wave and the previous one, proving that the virus is not more fatal. However, the deaths may be higher now because the health system has been overburdened. And, we keep on adding more cases every day for which we need to add more infrastructure every day,\u201d said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.The situation could ease by a small degree later this week as the Union government decided to revive the Covid-19 case facility in Chattarpur, which will have 500 beds with oxygen support to begin with.The facility, set up during the waves of infection recorded last year, was closed on February 23 when the outbreak appeared to have receded. It is now expected to be opened in three days\u2019 time with the Indo-Tibet Border Police managing operations.\u201cDelhi government has assured us they will set-up the infrastructure in maximum three days and hand over the facility to us. Our team of doctors and paramedics is ready. It will be operational in two-three days,\u201d director general of ITBP, SS Deswal, told HT.The facility, named Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre, is at the Radha Soami Beas grounds.\u201cThe Delhi government had sought medical officers and para-medical staff from the ministry of home affairs to man the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre at Chhattarpur, which is being re-operationalised. The Ministry of Home Affairs has designated ITBP as the nodal force for operating the facility,\u201d a home ministry spokesperson said.\u201cIt has been decided to provide an adequate number of medical officers and para-medical staff to man 500 oxygenated beds to Sardar Patel Covid centre, Chhattarpur in Delhi,\u201d said an MHA letter reviewed by HT.An officer, who didn\u2019t want to be named, said they are hoping to increase the number of beds to 1,500 by the first week of May."},

But considering the strict restrictions of lockdown from April 22, this will not be possible. Such universities had approached the department seeking permission to hold all exams completely online, following which the decision was taken. All universities and colleges have been instructed to ensure that no student misses the online examination,\u201d said Samant adding that this decision was taken after discussing the options with the chancellor of all state universities, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari.Recently, several scheduled examinations had to be postponed due to the surge in Covid-19 cases across the country. School education boards including Maharashtra state, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) as well as Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) decided to cancel their Class 10 board exams and postpone Class 12 exams this year. Similarly, the National Testing Agency (NTA) postponed all-India competitive exams indefinitely.University of Mumbai (MU) had released a circular in March clarifying that all university exams will be conducted in online mode in multiple choice questions (MCQ) format. \u201cNot just theory exams, but affiliated colleges have also ensured that practical exams are conducted online.

With her class being conducted online since March 2020, Kadam said that it was becoming a big challenge for the students. \u201cLast year, all these students passed without proper assessments and this year too, the same will repeat. However, there are a few students who are lagging behind their other counterparts in terms of learning key concepts. We are now working on these students to bridge the learning gap that has been seen due to online learning,\u201d said Kadam. As schools and colleges remain online for more than a year now, understanding and evaluating the academic performance of students and taking corrective action is becoming one of the biggest challenges for teachers and schools. In 2020, students from Classes 1 to 8 were promoted based on internal assessments conducted at the school level. Class 9 and 11 students underwent tests and exams online. Those who failed to clear these exams had to undergo another round of tests in the days to come. Students in colleges and universities had to undergo online multiple-choice questions (MCQ) to pass their semesters. This year, students of Class 1 to 12 barring Class 10 and 12 will be promoted to the next class without any exams. \u2018Can have disastrous consequences\u2019Experts said that not being able to conduct assessments of students can have disastrous consequences on their overall learning outcomes of students. Sudam Kumbhar, former principal of Shailendra High School in Dahisar said that the consequences are particularly alarming for students from low-income households. \u201cIn families with low economic means, the children have already suffered a lot due to the pandemic. There are anxieties about employment and overall existence. In online classes, nearly 50% of students are often absent because they are accompanying their parents to their workplaces or have no access to phones and gadgets. It thus becomes crucial to assess the learning levels of such students which will not happen systematically because there are no exams and assessments,\u201d added Kumbhar. Over the last year, a large number of students from colleges and universities who were previously struggling to get their backlogs cleared have managed to pass, said colleges. This is particularly a cause of concern because there is no way to know whether these students have merely passed the exams or have understood the subject during this time.\u201cEvery year, some students in every class end up with ATKT (allowed to keep terms) which they carry forward to the next semester. In some cases, students carry forward their KTs for two years but all this changed with the MCQ format of exams. While students have passed the exam, we are doubting how much of the subject they\u2019ve realistically understood,\u201d said the principal of a suburban college. Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College in Bandra said, \u201cEven though most students in our institute have scored very well, teachers are worried that students have not understood basic concepts and this will affect their ability to understand larger concepts in the future courses/subjects.\u201dLack of learning continuityIn December 2020, Leadership for Equity, a Pune-based NGO that works closely with the state education department conducted a community survey to assess the impact of the pandemic on learning. The sample survey conducted across six districts in the state (Pune, Akola, Satara, Solapur, Ahmednagar, Nashik) revealed that one of the biggest repercussions of prolonged school closures was the lack of learning continuity among students. A large number of parents and teachers expressed concerns about learning losses as only about two of the 10 students surveyed, reported having access to a phone during their study time. In eight of the 10 households, more than one person was sharing a phone thus raising concerns about the reach of online learning. Standard guidelines are importantFrancis Joseph, a city-based educationist and the co-founder of SLN Global Network said that in the days to come, it is important to have consistency and universality in strategies used for bridging the learning gaps. \u201cRight now, each school is working on addressing issues arising out of online learning at its level as per its understanding. We need to understand that school leaders are not necessarily experts in pedagogy and thus boards need to come up with a set of standard guidelines for this. We need to understand that under the current circumstance, the entire schooling system needs to slow down a bit and rework its entire structure to make it easier on students for the coming 2-3 years. The repercussions of the losses during the pandemic will have to be dealt with even in the years to come,\u201d he added. Trial by error learningThe sudden change from regular classes to the virtual mode affected teaching as well as learning modules across higher education institutes. Several colleges started training teachers before starting regular lectures but for a large chunk of teachers, learning was trial by error. \u201cMost colleges were waiting for the University of Mumbai to announce the course of action, and once the announcement to start classes in the virtual mode came through, colleges were unprepared. Many of us understood the virtual classroom on our own by making many mistakes and learning from them,\u201d said a senior professor from a suburban college. While theory sessions were conducted smoothly by colleges, practical sessions were a challenge for many. \u201cWe used the best technology possible and recorded videos of practical sessions for students, which were shared regularly. In case some students did not understand the concept, we allowed them to physically report to the college and conducted practical sessions keeping social distancing in mind,\u201d said Hemlata Bagla, principal of KC College, Churchgate. She added that students preferred depending on virtual classes as compared to physical classes as many were back in their hometowns and travelling would\u2019ve been a problem. Increase in learning inequalitiesEducationists said while assessing the performance of students is a tough task without conducting periodic tests and exams, governments need to understand that learning losses due to the pandemic is a very critical concern. \u201cLike always, it is going to increase learning inequalities. Those who can afford the best tutors and help will sail through. For families where retaining children in schools is a challenge, these learning losses would pose challenges in future as students have to compete for various exams,\u201d added Kumbhar.\u201cFor the poor, their marks are the only gateway to a good education and if learning is not equal, we cannot test students on the same levels for sure,\u201d said a teacher."},

Our ambitious renewable energy target of 450 GW by 2030 shows our commitment. Despite our development challenges, we have taken many bold steps on clean energy, energy efficiency, afforestation and biodiversity. We are among few countries whose NDCs (nationally determined contribution, under the Paris climate deal) are 2 degree C compatible,\u201d PM Modi said in an address to 40 other world leaders who participated in the two-day summit called by Biden. \u201cPresident Biden and I are launching the India-US Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 partnership. We will help mobilise investment, demonstrate clean technologies and enable green collaborations,\u201d he added.No details were available yet on the India-US initiative, but on a visit to India last month, Biden\u2019s special envoy on climate, John Kerry, said that \u201chuge investments\u201d will be forthcoming in India by the US and other countries in return for \u201csome changes by India\u201d.Earlier this month, Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar underscored India\u2019s prerogative to balance development goals with obligations on the climate crisis, saying that India will attempt to keep its climate commitments but will not act at the behest or under pressure from developed countries.According to a White House statement, Biden\u2019s move to upgrade the country\u2019s NDCs on Thursday will steer the world towards achieving the Paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C.The Climate Action Tracker, however, said that the US will need to do even more. Instead of the revised aim to cut 50-52% in national emissions, it will need to shave off at least 57-63% emissions below 2005 levels by 2030 and provide support to other countries to meet the Paris goals.Following the US\u2019s announcement, independent experts said it is time for all countries, including India, to scale up action against climate crisis.\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s upgraded NDC is a game changer. For too long the US has not put out an aggressive emissions reduction target. All countries could benchmark their lack of progress against the US... It\u2019s time for all nations including India to upgrade action. As per the Climate Action Tracker, India\u2019s NDC is 2\u00b0C compliant but not 1.5\u00b0C target compliant. We should ramp up action for our own good,\u201d said Sunita Narain, director general, Centre for Science and Environment.\u201cThe new US climate target is a step in the right direction: all major economies should be shifting towards cutting their emissions at least 50% by 2030,\u201d tweeted Laurence Tubiana, CEO European Climate Foundation and one of the architects of the Paris agreement.In its Biennial Update Report to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) submitted in February, India said it has progressively decoupled economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions and it was on track to meet its voluntary declaration to reduce emission intensity of GDP by 20-25% from 2005 levels by 2020. The report, however, also noted that India\u2019s reliance on coal will continue to meet the country\u2019s energy needs.On Thursday, President Xi Jinping reiterated that China\u2019s carbon emissions will peak before 2030 and the country will achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced that Japan aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The United Kingdom too led with a target of cutting emissions by 78% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels.The summit, termed by Biden as a milestone leading up to the UN Climate Change Conference 2021 in Glasgow this November, was also attended by UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin."},

Taking the SII price as the benchmark for now, vaccination people between 18 and 44 years of age could range anywhere between 47,500 crore to 71,500 crore, depending on whether the SII vaccine is procured at ?400 per dose or ?600 dose. Where does this number come from? The total population of 18-44-year-old age-group in India is expected to be 594.6 million, according to the report of the government\u2019s Technical Group on Population Projections. This report also gives the statewise break-up of the 18-44 population. This number, when multiplied by ?800 or 1200 (for two doses of Covidshield) gives the total cost of 47,566 crore or 7,1349 crore. Uttar Pradesh, the state with the largest population of 18-44 year olds will have to spend between 7,970 crore to 11,960 crore for vaccinations. For smaller states such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand this number will be in the range of 400- 625 crore respectively.The absolute cost of vaccination, while it is important, does not tell us about the fiscal burden on the states. In order to calculate this, it is useful to look at the vaccine cost (at 800 for two doses) as a share of the total spending of states. An HT analysis shows that the fiscal burden of vaccination, defined as cost of vaccination as a share of total budgeted spending of states, will vary in a big way across states. Among 21 states for which data is available in the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy\u2019s (CMIE) database and population projection report, Bihar will face the highest burden \u2013 1.8% of total state spending in 2021-22. This number is the lowest in Himachal Pradesh, where the burden will be just 0.54% of the budgeted state spending. All state budget numbers are 2021-22 budget estimates except for Punjab and Andhra Pradesh where 2020-21 numbers have been used. The total cost of  assuming everybody in the 18-44 age-groups was to use the state government supply would be 47,565.8 crore, or 26% of the total health spending of the states in 2020-21 as per CMIE data.To be sure, the net cost per person for different governments will likely be lower than these estimates because some people might take the private route for vaccinating themselves and it is possible that some state governments ask some sections of the population to foot the bill for vaccination in part or full.Since India does not release income data for its workers, the best way to answer this question is to use earnings estimates given in the latest Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data. These are 2018-19 figures, but HT has not adjusted them for inflation, given the uncertainty about the adverse impact of the pandemic on employment and earnings. According to PLFS, there were 356 million workers in India in 2018-19 in the current weekly status, or the status of employment during the week preceding the survey. Wage data is available only for this status. PLFS classifies workers into four categories: regular wage/salaried, self-employed, casual workers, and casual workers employed in public works such as MGNREGS. Among these four, regular wage salaried workers had the highest incomes, while the casual workers engaged in public works (about 1% of workers) had the lowest incomes. 22% of Indian workers are casual workers other than public works, who earn an average of 8,340 per month.It is to be expected that an earning member in a household might have to buy vaccines for more than one person in the household, as every member in the 18-44 year age-group might not be employed. According to PLFS, the work force participation rate in the 18-44 year age-group was 51.6% in 2018-19. This means that 48.4% of the population in this age-group is not working. An HT analysis of unit level PLFS data can help in finding out the actual burden of vaccinating people in the 18-44 year age-group by calculating the number of 18-44 year olds in that household and total household earnings irrespective of the age of the earning member. This exercise shows that an average Indian household will end up spending 24% of its monthly incomes on vaccinating its 18-44 members if it was to spend 1,200 for both doses. This headline number varies greatly across income class and states. For the bottom 20% of households, this burden will be 43% of their monthly incomes. For the top 20%, this number will be 12% of the household monthly income. The financial burden, as is to be expected, will be significantly higher in rural areas (31%) compared to urban areas (16%).As in the case of the fiscal burden, the private cost of vaccinations will also burden households differently across states. Replicating the analysis used above at the state level, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Odisha, and Jharkhand will have the highest burden while household in richer states will face a smaller burden."},

They don\u2019t have any option available. I have been receiving calls, messages, e-mails. We have been making internal, makeshift arrangements, but this cannot continue for long,\u201d he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, spoke on the , asking states to come down heavily on hoarding and fix responsibility with local administration in cases of obstruction. He told officials to ensure a \u201csmooth, unhindered\u201d supply of oxygen to various states at a review meeting on Thursday.The problem came into focus early on Tuesday when several hospitals in the Capital said they were on the verge of supplies running out, which would end oxygen support to critically ill patients. The problem recurred on Wednesday and Thursday, with close to 1,000 patients being in danger on both days.On Thursday, multiple hospitals -- including Sir Ganga Ram, Saroj, Holy Family, Aakash, and Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty \u2014 said they had either run out of their liquid medical oxygen and had switched to back-up cylinders, or were soon in danger of running out. Some even discharged patients and asked them to go to other facilities.\u201cOur officials and even the Central government officials have tried to talk to officials in these states, but the situation on the ground has not changed. Our tankers are still waiting outside the plants. In the plants located in Haryana, only tankers from that state are being allowed to go in for refilling,\u201d said Sisodia, who is also the nodal minister for Covid-19 in Delhi.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal later raised the issue with his Haryana counterpart.The Union government increased Delhi\u2019s quota of daily oxygen supply from 378MT to 480MT on Wednesday, but officials said even this may not be adequate and the additional capacity was likely to take time to arrive.\u201cThe Centre decides the companies from which we get oxygen. The revised quota that the Centre has allotted to us, a substantial part of it is to come from Odisha. But it will take several days to bring by road. We are exploring if bringing oxygen from there by air is possible. We are trying for that,\u201d Kejriwal said.A government spokesperson said supplies may reach the city too late. \u201cWhat remains a matter of grave concern is that of the 480 metric tonnes, 100 MT oxygen from Odisha (70 MT) and West Bengal (30 MT) will take almost 72 hours to reach Delhi. Our citizens, our hospitals, our city are running out of time. Meanwhile, the 140-metric tonne which Haryana has to supply is yet to leave for Delhi,\u201d said the spokesperson.On Friday, PM Modi is also scheduled to meet chief ministers of regions with a high Covid-19 burden."},

There seems to be a sudden surge in the number of Covid patients and mortality,\u201d said the bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, while taking a suo motu cognisance of the surge in infections, which have led to a shortage of hospital beds and crucial supplies such as medical oxygen and medicines.The order said its focus areas at this time were the supply of medical oxygen, essential medicines, the method and manner of vaccination, and the declaration of lockdowns to check the spread of the disease.Issuing the notices to the Union and state governments, it asked solicitor general Tushar Mehta to remain present in the court with the national plan on availability and distribution of essential supplies and services. The bench, which also includes justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, appointed senior advocate Harish Salve as amicus curiae to assist the court.A day after India saw the world\u2019s biggest one-day jump in the country again broke all records as 332,394 new infections and 2,255 deaths were reported on Thursday, both new single-day records.The ferocious second wave of infections has overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums across the country and has led to frantic cries for help on social media as patients throughout the country struggled to arrange for beds, key medical supplies such as oxygen and medicines.Pointing out that at least six high courts were hearing issues related to the preparedness of the states and the Centre to deal with the crisis, the bench also issued notices to the petitioners before the high courts, asking why uniform orders should not be passed by the Supreme Court.\u201cThe high courts have passed certain orders which may have the effect of accelerating and prioritising the services to a certain set of people and slowing down the availability of these resources to certain other groups whether the groups are local, regional or otherwise,\u201d recorded the court in its order, while telling Mehta that these orders were also creating confusion and diversion of resources because of different priorities.\u201cPrima facie, we are inclined to take the view that the distribution of these essential services and supplies must be done in an even-handed manner according to the advice of the health authorities which undoubtedly take into account relevant factors like severity, susceptibility, the number of people affected and the local availability of resources,\u201d the court recorded in its four-page order.On the issue of lockdowns, the CJI, whose bench had on Tuesday stayed an order of the Allahabad high court for virtually locking down five worst-hit districts of Uttar Pradesh, observed that this authority should be with the state government. \u201cWe want to keep the power to declare lockdown with states. It cannot be a judicial decision,\u201d he remarked.In its order, the apex court also asked the Union government to apprise it of existence or requirement of a coordinating body that could consider allocation of the resources in a consultative manner with the involvement of concerned states and Union territories in addition to providing logistical support for transportation and distribution of essential medicines, oxygen and other resources.The bench further asked the Centre to consider the declaration of essential medicines and medical equipment required for treatment of Covid-19 as \u201cessential commodities\u201d under the law.When Mehta asked if the Centre was still required to make submissions before the high courts after the top court\u2019s cognisance, justice Bhat said that the central government should go ahead and adduce its national plan before high courts since the idea was not to supersede high court orders at this moment. However, the CJI was of the opinion that it was perhaps a better idea for the Supreme Court to hear everything together and the matters before the high courts could be transferred to it.During the hearing, the bench had observed that it will issue a notice only to the Centre at the moment. But the written order released in the evening mentioned notices to all the states as well as the petitioners before the high courts.Experts questioned this move.Senior counsel and former additional solicitor general Indira Jaising, however, questioned why justice Bobde put the matter before himself on Friday when he knew that he will not be able to deal with it after one hearing because he is demitting office.\u201cNo one had complained about any high court order. So who was the aggrieved party? Can high court orders be bypassed without being challenged? If the Delhi high court had not stepped in at a late-night hearing on Wednesday, many more lives would have been lost,\u201d she told HT, referring to the high court\u2019s order on a Max hospital plea urgently seeking medical oxygen.Former attorney general and senior lawyer Mukul Rohatgi also termed the suo motu registration of the case as \u201cill-conceived\u201d.\u201cIn Covid times, the apex court is hardly functioning when you have just two-three benches sitting there off late. On the other hand, high courts have been doing a great job. They should not be stultified. Proactive high court benches across the nation should rather get a pat on their back for holding courts at all times and rising to the occasion. In any case, this issue should have been left to the new CJI who takes over on Saturday, just a day later.\u201dSalve, who was present in the court on behalf of Vedanta with a request for reopening its Sterlite Copper plant in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Thoothukudi to produce and supply oxygen for Covid-19 patients, said people were dying every day. \u201cWe want this permission only for starting the oxygen plant. And we will supply it free of cost. Give us the permission today and we can start producing it in 5-6 days.\u201dThe plant was shut down in May 2018 after 13 civilians were shot dead in the anti-Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi. The Madras high court in August 2020 rejected Vedanta\u2019s petition to reopen the plant, citing environmental concerns. The Supreme Court has also rejected requests to reopen the plant for a trial run.Salve said Vedanta was pleading only for making the oxygen plant in Thoothukudi functional so that it could provide thousands of tonnes of oxygen for medical purposes.Mehta cited the dire need for medical oxygen and added that the Centre was augmenting its supply from all possible sources. \u201cLet Vedanta operate its plant only for the purpose of producing oxygen and this will be diverted only for medical purposes. Sooner the plant starts functioning, better for the country.\u201dSenior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, who represented the Tamil Nadu government, said there was a \u201ctrust deficit\u201d with Vedanta. He added the violations for which the plant was shut could not be ignored. The state government opposed any urgent hearing of Vedanta\u2019s application.Justice Bobde questioned the Tamil Nadu government\u2019s attitude. \u201cWhat is this attitude? You are not manufacturing it [oxygen] and you will be getting it free of cost for your medical emergencies. We will make sure they follow all environmental norms, but we do not appreciate your attitude. This is a national emergency. Do not throw spokes like this,\u201d the CJI told Vaidyanathan, while fixing the hearing into the matter on Friday.Mehta said between protecting human life and the environment, they must lean toward protecting human lives."},

Of them, Ahmednagar recorded the highest at 1.4%, followed by Nagpur (0.95%), Mumbai (0.64%), Nashik (0.62%) and Pune (0.33%). The TPR, however, was the highest in Nagpur with 34%, while Pune district recorded 26.64% and Mumbai posted 17.21% in the same period. Nashik and Ahmednagar did not reveal their tests, and therefore the TPR could not be calculated. State-wide, the average daily cases touched 64,238, while daily deaths averaged 443 -- highest ever in the pandemic in the country \u2013 in the same time period. The state\u2019s TPR averaged 24.81%. The CFR was 0.69% in the same period.To be sure, the CFR in Maharashtra has been consistently falling since January 31. On that day, the overall CFR stood at 2.52%. This fell to 1.54% on April 21. The main reason for this was that deaths have not increased in the same proportion as cases. On January 31, Maharashtra recorded 2630 cases and 42 deaths. On April 21, it recorded 67,468 cases and 568 deaths, its highest one-day death toll.Ahmednagar faces a huge shortage of oxygen cylinders, and all the hospitals are full. The local authorities on Tuesday sought oxygen from Chakan in Pune. When the tanker reached the border, it was stopped by the Pune based authorities and made to halt for two hours. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had to intervene to offer reprieve to the patients.The Maharashtra Government announced a total lockdown which will come to force on Thursday night to contain the virus.The high number of cases in these places has resulted in the burdening of the medical infrastructure which means the shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and medicines.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has requested for supply of medical grade oxygen for the hospitals, following which the Centre has made a road map on supplying oxygen to the state.The Centre has earmarked 1661 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen to reach the state from various states, but it is as yet unclear when the oxygen is scheduled to reach.\u201cWe have taken various steps to ease the solution and would like the central government to cooperate with us to get out of this crisis. The Centre needs to increase its quota of oxygen cylinders and Remdesivir for Maharashtra,\u201d Tope said.In Pune, the total deaths due to Covid-19 have now reached to 8890 ever since the outbreak of the virus. Many of the small hospitals have stopped admitting patients due to the lack of oxygen. On Wednesday, the district recorded the largest number of cases and there are now 121,284 active cases.In Nagpur, a shortage of Remdesivir, an anti-viral injection, and medical grade oxygen prompted the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court (HC) to take suo moto cognizance of the shortages. On Wednesday night, at a late hearing, it pulled up the Centre for lessening the supply of oxygen from a Bhilai-based supplier, from 110MT to 60MT in a communication dated April 18.At a time when the supply of oxygen should have been increased it was reduced instead, the HC noted and ordered that the supply be restored. The region, it noted, was facing a shortfall of at least 100MT.Earlier in the week, it had asked the Central Controller of Drugs in India to ensure that 10,000 vials of Remdesivir be given to Nagpur. Two days later, the Court rapped the Maharashtra Government for its failure to comply fully with its order.Nashik has become another hotspot for the virus as there are currently 46,253 active patients on Wednesday and has registered a total number of 2701 deaths. The city is facing huge shortage of oxygen and families of patient are frantically searching for Remdesivir injections. \u201cWe need at least 125 metric tonnes but are getting only 85 metric tonnes. Even that is very erratic as it sometimes gets caught in various problems,\u201d said senior NCP Minister Chhagan Bhujbal.On Wednesday, one of the tankers supplying oxygen to patients receiving treatment for the coronavirus disease at Dr Zakir Naik Municipal Hospital malfunctioned, which led to the death of 24 persons.In Mumbai which has 84,450 active cases, the government is pulling all stops to beat the shortage. \u201cWe are making all efforts to save the lives of the people,\u201d said Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar.Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine, Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Hospital, said the people in metros are getting the virus due to various reasons.\u201cThese election rallies were super spreaders and thousands of people are coming from there in flights and railways.

NEET is an exam that over a million students take every year for admission to undergraduate medical courses in medical institutions, including premier ones like All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), among others. Last year alone, 1.6 million candidates registered for the exam; less than half qualified. Tendulkar and several like her are well aware of how competitive the entrance exam is. This has been her routine since 2019: \u201cMy day would start at 6am and I would study continuously till 9am. After a 30-minute break I would once again start at 10am and study till 2.30pm. My coaching institute lectures are scheduled in the afternoon till 7pm, following which I would have my dinner and then revise what was taught in class for an hour or two before calling it a day.\u201d However, the Ghatkopar resident feels in a bit of a limbo right now. On April 18, the National Testing Agency announced that Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains is postponed until further notice while the status of NEET, scheduled for August first week, is yet unknown. \u201cI feel this preparation time will never end and that is leaving me more anxious than ever,\u201d she said.Rising Covid-19 cases across the country has forced state and national school boards to cancel Class 10 board exams and postpone exams for Class 12 students. Similarly, entrance exams to all undergraduate professional courses have been pushed forward. IIT-Joint Entrance Exams (JEE-Mains) are usually held in April, followed by JEE-Advanced in May. NEET-UG too is scheduled for May every year. However, due to the national lockdown imposed last year, the exams were conducted between September and October 2020. This year, of the four sessions of JEE-Mains, two were held in February and March while April session has been postponed. Last year, by the time the national lockdown was imposed, most Class 10 and 12 students had been able to finish most of their board exams: Maharashtra state board Class 12 exams had finished; only one paper remained for those in Class 10; Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 10 and 12 board exams were done; and Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) board students were promoted based on the exams already held. As a result, students sitting for competitive exams this year worry that they may now have to take multiple exams in a stretch. \u201cMy daughter has not taken a vacation in over two years because her focus was to prepare herself best for Class 12 and NEET exams. But last year has been tough for her physically and mentally, and the fact that exams have once again been postponed is leaving her more anxious with every passing day,\u201d said Dr Bharat Shah, father of Manashvi Shah, 18. Shah joined integrated coaching classes after clearing Class 10 and has dedicated much of the past two years preparing for the all-India medical entrance test in the hope of becoming a neurosurgeon in the future. \u201cChildren have spent the last one year in front of a computer, and the constant postponement of exam dates are adding to the stress levels of already tired teenagers. As parents, we feel helpless,\u201d said Nisha Parmar, mother of Advait Parmar, 17.

Patients and their relatives are already struggling to get isolation beds, crucial lifesaving medicines and even oxygen supply in many city hospitals. On Wednesday, 879 infections were logged in the district, whose daily caseload has remained above 500 since April 16. A total of seven deaths were reported in the city, taking the total fatalities to 1,272. The corona case count of Ludhiana since the beginning of the pandemic stands at 46,358. There are 5,829 active cases in the district. The deceased included four men and three women, the youngest of whom was a 36-year-old male resident of Doraha. Two men from Urban Estate, Dugri, aged 71 and 76, succumbed to the virus. There has been a surge in coronavirus cases in Dugri, which is currently under lockdown. Among the other victims were a 79-year-old woman of Kitchlu Nagar, a 72-year-old woman of Harnampura village, a 50-year-old man from SBS Nagar, and an 80-year-old woman from Shivala Road area. As many as 80 beds are currently occupied in government hospitals, while 836 isolation beds in wards of private hospitals are filled. The number of patients in active home isolation is 7,337. The increasing shortage of beds prompted the Ludhiana deputy commissioner to make an emotive appeal to hospitals to double the number of beds on their premises. DC Varinder Kumar Sharma said that there was an immediate need to increase the bed capacity to deal with the second wave and ensuring quality treatment to the patients while reducing mortality. He said that the bed capacity must be enhanced immediately as it was important to ensure every patient got best possible care. Interacting with the representatives of all prominent private hospitals of the district via videoconference, the DC urged them to listen to their conscience while making any decision as people had high hopes from all of them. In his appeal to the hospitals, Sharma said every single life was precious and the hospitals should ensure no person entering their premises dies due to lack of treatment. The administration launched oxygen helpline numbers \u2014 7837018500 and 0161-2421091 \u2014 which will remain operational 24x7 and function from the police control room. Anyone who is facing any difficulty in availing medical oxygen supply in Ludhiana for Covid patients can dial these numbers and oxygen cylinders will be made available to them on payment basis. Even as many private hospitals reported shortage of oxygen cylinders with the relatives of Covid patients seeking help from outside, the DC assured the residents that there was no shortage of oxygen in the district, so there was no need to panic. He said that different teams have been formed that would visit industrial units as well as hospitals to check hoarding of oxygen cylinders. He warned that any violation in this regard will not be tolerated. DC Sharma said that elective surgeries have already been deferred beyond April 30 till further orders. \u201cWe will also provide green corridors to oxygen-carrying vehicles in Ludhiana so that they promptly reach to their destination,\u201d police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said.

To top it all, hospitals are expressing helplessness and asking the attendants of patients to arrange the medicine. The sudden dearth of drug has led to a mad rush among the patients\u2019 relatives as those \u2018not so resourceful\u2019 are frantically calling their friends and looking for some \u2018influential contact\u2019 to source the medicine. Social media platforms are flooded with distress messages and requests for tocilizumab. Rishi Sood, a drug trader, said, \u201cThere already is an acute shortage of beds for Covid patients. If one becomes available, then the relatives have to run from pillar to post to arrange medicines such as tocilizumab. The drug is currently not available.\u201d It is not the first time that the city hospitals are facing a tocilizumab crunch. In August last year too, when the Covid cases had begun to peak, the drug marketed by a Swiss multinational pharmaceutical company as Actemra was sold in the black market for nearly 40,000. GS Chawla, general secretary of the Chemist Association of Punjab, has claimed that there is an acute shortage of remdesivir, while tocilizumab is not available across the country as its salt is sourced from abroad while the medicine is being manufactured in India. \u201cThe government has taken the distribution of the medicine under its control and it is being allocated to the hospitals as per the requirement,\u201d he added.Dr Rajoo Singh Chhina, director, gastroenterology, Fortis Hospital, Ludhiana, and technical adviser, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), blamed hoarding for the current crisis.\u201cThere is no stock available in the hospitals and we keep hearing stories of how a handful of people are putting lives at stake by hoarding the medicine. It is a war-like situation and unfortunately, we are on the frontline without ammunition. The crises have been created due to unnecessary hoarding, perhaps for petty monetary gains. People should act responsibly and help each other. It is the only way we can win over the virus,\u201d said Dr Chhina.Dr Amit Gulrez, deputy medical superintendent, CMCH, also said the stocks of tocilizumab have dried up. \u201cThere are patients who need tocilizumab, but we have been told that it is not available anywhere. The injection is used to treat Covid patients when they fail to respond to any other treatment in a critical stage and are in respiratory distress.\u201dHowever, senior cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan, who is a member of the Covid taskforce of the state, said new findings and treatment protocols have suggested alternative treatments if tocilizumab is unavailable.\u201cSo we have to look for an alternative. But at the same time, concerted effort should be made to spread awareness among people to stop hoarding life-saving drugs,\u201d he added.SMO Dr Hitinder Kaur said while there is adequate stock of remdesivir, tocilizumab is not available for long. She said the medicine was earlier used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, which is now being used for critically ill Covid patients.Punjab\u2019s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the state government has floated tenders and within a few days, tocilizumab will be available. Meanwhile, the Ludhiana health department received 40,000 vaccines on Thursday to replenish its stocks. On running out of its vaccine stock, the Ludhiana health department had suspended the vaccine supply to private hospitals in the district till further orders on April 20.Sharing details, district immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja said they have received 40,000 Covishield vaccines on Thursday from Chandigarh for the smooth conduct of vaccination process.He said that the current batch of vaccines will be used only at the government-run centres. After running out of both Covidshield and Covaxin vaccines, the supply to 85 private hospitals in the district, which were also inoculating people, was stopped.With 80 patients admitted to the Ludhiana civil hospital\u2019s Covid ward, 52 of them on oxygen and 14 on ventilator support on Thursday, the facility is staring at serious manpower crises.The issue of staff scarcity came to the fore after SDM (East) Dr Baljinder Singh Dhillon expressed concern over the shortage of nurses and attendants at the civil hospital and asked for urgent recruitment of 20 paramedical staffers.SMO and Covid unit in-charge of the hospital, Dr Hitinder Kaur, said, \u201cWe have adequate staff to run the health services in mother and child hospital and emergency services, but the sudden rise in the number of Covid patients has mounted extra pressure on us.\u201d\u201cCurrently, the staffers are working in three shifts. We have arranged staff from other government hospitals and primary health centres, but that is not enough. For ICU duties, we need to have three times the existing staff strength,\u201d she added.Bhupinder Kaur, nursing in-charge of the civil hospital, said besides the staff shortage, there were other challenges as well. \u201cSometimes, the nursing staffers get infected or their family members contract virus and then they cannot perform duty for the next 17 days. Like other hospitals, we are also battling with such issues,\u201d she said.Lately, 50 paramedical staffers had been performing duties in three shifts in Covid emergency, triage, trauma, male isolation, female isolation, and ICU of the hospital. Out of them, five employees were found suffering from Covid.On Thursday, one paramedical staffer was available for four wards, while two nursing staff members were present in the ICU."},

It was manufactured in 2014 to treat Ebola, and has since been used to treat SARS and MERS. In 2020, the drug was repurposed for Covid treatment and clinical experience has shown that it works best in mildly ill to severe Covid-19 patients.In the Covid-19 hotbeds districts of the state, including Amritsar, Patiala, Jalandhar and Ludhiana, the patients are struggling to get Remdesivir injections from government and private hospitals as India is grappling to meet the rising demand of the anti-viral drug.Addressing shortages of Remdesivir in certain and most infected regions of the country, the Central government made interim allocation of the key anti-viral drug for 19 states and Union Territories, including Punjab, for the period up to 30 April. Under the allocation, the Government of India had decided to send 13,400 doses to Punjab.Also, the state health department has placed an order of additional 8,000 doses from private firms, which they are expecting to receive in coming 2-3 days, to ensure easy availability of the anti-viral drug in government and private hospitals.\u201cRemdesivir is not available in Patiala hospitals, both government and private, while its demand is increasing with every positive patient. We have made requests to the state health department to ensure its availability in the market so as to avoid black marketing and hoarding,\u201d said Patiala civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh, adding that due to shortage, some healthcare officials are demanding thousands of rupees for one Remdesivir dose.Till Thursday evening, there were around 40,584 active Covid-19 cases in Punjab, of which nearly 508 are on oxygen support. Health experts believe that even the 21,400 Remdesivir doses may fall short in the next ten days as the state is reporting a new spike of infection daily.\u201cRemdesivir is basically an experimental drug for use, the efficacy of which has not been proven yet. But still, being the only anti viral drug available in the country, people are purchasing it from private chemist shops at high price. The injection is given to moderate and severely ill patients but it is not a life saving drug. Also, there is no confirmation that it will reduce hospitalisation hours or will decrease the chances of mortality. The people, who are spending thousands of rupees on a single dose or are black marketing the stock of Remdesivir, is completely illogical\u201d, said state nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.He added: \u201cAt present, we have 750 doses of Remdesivir in state\u2019s government and private hospitals and the daily usage of the anti-viral drug is 40 to 50 doses, across the state. However, as people are searching for the injection in the market, we will ensure its easy availability for which 21,400 doses are awaited. We will distribute its stock to each district, according to positive case load and active cases. The districts\u2019 officials will then supply it to government and private hospitals. Also, the state has enough stock of other equipment and drugs needed for Covid-19 treatment.\u201d"},

Sharply criticising Modi\u2019s speech, the editorial published on Thursday said, \u201cPM Modi says that the Covid-19 crisis is huge and is like a storm. But he did not give solutions to protect [the country] from this storm. People have lost their relatives. PM expressed his grief on it, but what is he doing to ensure that the toll does not increase further? The Covid-19 situation is critical across the nation and not just in Maharashtra. People expected to gain strength from PM\u2019s address. But the essence of the speech was \u201cthe crisis is huge. You figure out your way, and take care\u201d.\u201d The Sena has been critical of the Centre over its response to the assistance sought by the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government to tackle the Covid-19 situation in the state. The Sena leaders have slammed the Centre for providing inadequate supply of vaccination doses, controlling distribution of Remdesivir and the supply of medical use oxygen. The editorial said that despite strict restrictions imposed by the Maharashtra government, the Covid-19 cases are not coming under control. In an apparent response to Modi\u2019s statement that lockdown should be the last resort, the editorial added that a complete lockdown has become \u201cessential\u201d. It further said that Modi cancelled his visit to Portugal in the view of Covid-19, but had he not conducted crowded election rallies in West Bengal in time, the virus could have been prevented. The editorial said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) mobilised lakhs of people across the country to campaign in West Bengal, who returned to their respective states with the infection. \u201cHaridwar\u2019s Kumbh Mela and West Bengal\u2019s political mela have only given coronavirus to the country. Rulers have to impose restrictions on themselves first. This gives them the moral right to give advice to the public,\u201d it said. Highlighting the severe shortage of medical use oxygen, the editorial said the country expected that the PM would speak on the issue and provide solutions. \u201cPM and his colleagues should try to provide oxygen where there is a shortage. Today that is the most necessary thing. Instead of that, everybody is making speeches and releasing carbon dioxide and spreading poison. This is the time to act and not make speeches.\u201d Reacting to the criticism, Maharashtra BJP\u2019s chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that the Sena-led state government failed to tackle the crisis, but is blaming the Centre. \u201cWhat Sanjay Raut has said [about PM\u2019s address] \u2014 the crisis is huge and you have to figure a way out \u2014 is actually Maharashtra chief minister\u2019s (CM) policy from the past one year. While the pandemic is raging in Maharashtra, the Centre has provided assistance. But what steps did the CM take, how many times did he step out, what planning was done for hospital beds, oxygen and Remdesivir last year.

Rajan and Jaiswal were acquitted for want of cogent evidence. Kadawala, an accused in the March 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts case, was shot dead by three men on February 7, 2001, in his office. As per the prosecution case, Kadawala was booked for helping actor Sanjay Dutt hide the AK-47 and the consignment of weapons that were used in the blasts, at the actor\u2019s garage. The weapons were delivered to him by gangster Abu Salem, who was a part of the Dawood Ibrahim gang. Kadawala was arrested by the police under Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) in April 1993 for transporting weapons from the Gujarat coast to Mumbai under gangster Tiger Memon directions. CBI had alleged that Rajan had ordered Kadawala\u2019s killing, as part of a \u201cnationalist\u201d drive to kill those accused in the bombings. Prior to the assault on Kadawala, Rajan\u2019s men had allegedly carried out attacks on some others accused in the bomb blasts case.

Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said a plan is being chalked out to procure vaccines. \u201cA plan is being worked out\u2026 since foreign import is now allowed and there is Bharat Biotech, we will get in touch with them. The vaccination drive for [age] 18 to 44 will start on May 1, but the stock is expected to be limited. In that age group, there are roughly 55 or 57.5 million people. So, we will require about 120 million doses, including the wastage, over a span of four to five months, depending on how soon we get the stock,\u201d said Kunte.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held an online meeting with Serum Institute of India\u2019s Adar Poonawalla on Wednesday, where he was told that the company\u2019s production has been booked till May 24. In light of that, the state will start negotiations with manufacturers of imported vaccines as it will not be able to purchase stock from Serum Institute of India, which makes Covidshield, till third week of May, and Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, as it has not released its prices.\u201cAdar Poonawalla [during a meeting] told the chief minister that their entire production has been booked by the Centre till May 24. It is April 22 today, so, it is clear that for an entire month we will not be able to purchase [vaccine] for the 18-45 age group. Senior officials are in touch with Bharat Biotech, but so far, they have not released the price for state governments. If that happens in a day or two, we will be able to place order with them,\u201d Tope said.However, the Centre refuted the claim and said that Serum Institute has not contracted all its production of vaccines to the Centre till May 25. A statement from the PIB said, \u201cState governments are free to procure Covid-19 vaccine doses from the vaccine manufacturers as per the Liberalised Pricing and accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy.\u201d It further added, \u201cA key feature of the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy is that the \u201cVaccine manufacturers would supply 50% of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to Govt. of India and would be free to supply remaining 50% doses to state governments and in the other than Govt. of India channel\u201d. The state governments are free to purchase doses from the vaccine manufacturers. Therefore, it is very clear that every month out of the total CDL cleared doses available with any vaccine manufacturer, 50% doses would be available for other than Government of India channels.\u201dEarlier in the week, deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar had said that the state would use certain development funds, but not hamper the procuring of imported vaccines, if need be. Tope added that the state would negotiate with the companies including Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Sputnik V to buy the \u201cextremely expensive\u201d imported vaccines. \u201cSputnik V, Moderna, American and the Chinese vaccines are extremely expensive compared to our vaccines. These vaccines are about seven to 10 times costlier than then Indian ones. But we can carry out a negotiation at the highest level with them. Chief minister and deputy chief minister have already made it clear that our government will consider [purchasing] it, if they reduce the prices since we are going to purchase in a huge volume,\u201d he added. Kunte added that the state will also hold talks with Bharat Biotech soon. \u201cThere will be a wide range of choice,\u201d he said.The health minister also said that the state government would consider providing free vaccines to \u201cpoor and extremely poor\u201d section of the society in the age group of 18 to 44 years. He said such a proposal will be mooted by the health department and the State Cabinet will take a call on it soon. He however ruled out free vaccines for others who can afford the jab.\u201cWe will be taking up the matter of providing vaccines for free in the upcoming cabinet meeting. The government will definitely think of the poor and extremely poor sections of society. But who can afford the vaccines in the 18 to 44 age bracket must pay for the vaccine shot. The health department will put up a proposal to give vaccines for free to the poor, but the final decision will be taken by the Cabinet,\u201d he said. Currently, the vaccination is free for all in those who are 45 and above. For those who want to pay for the vaccine, have an option to get vaccinated from selected private hospitals. "},

It asked the ministries and departments to take such complaints against employees to their \u201clogical conclusion\u201d within three months of the date of receipt of the complaint.\u201cLogical conclusion here implies that the decision shall be taken by the organisation to either file the complaint, or register a vigilance case for further investigation, or register a non-vigilance administrative action case for further investigation,\u201d the CVC order said.\u201cAs a pilot, to begin with, the backlog complaints received till December 31, 2020 shall be disposed of according to the guidelines issued in this circular and compliance reported by May 31, 2021,\u201d the order added.At the end of the third month from the date of receipt of a complaint, and after deciding the course of action, a copy of the complaint shall be made available to the employee concerned within 15 days through speed post, it said. If the name of the employee is not explicitly mentioned, a copy of the complaint will be made available to the staff concerned at the stage of registration of a vigilance or non-vigilance case, the order further said.Subsequently, if a decision has been made to take up the matter as a vigilance case, the organisation concerned shall send its inquiry report to the commission or Chief Vigilance Officer (CVO) seeking advice within three months of registration of such a case, it added.Lauding the directive, former ONGC chairman R S Sharma said: \u201cThese investigations drag on for months, sometimes years and at the time of empanelment of an officer, these are brought out to deny promotion or other due benefits. Delay in completing these investigations leads to harassment. The CVC directive is appreciable. It is in the interest of natural justice.\u201d"},

The Sena has raked the issue around 480-km south of the Maximum City in Belgaum, Karnataka, while campaigning for the Lok Sabha bypoll. Political analysts opined that the agenda would have an influence in the city\u2019s civic polls.Apart of the Belgaum issue, the Sena has subtly painted the ongoing tussle between the Centre and the state government led by the party, over oxygen supply and shortage of Remdesivir.Former Union minister and Sena parliamentarian Arvind Sawant said that while the Centre says that Maharashtra is the most-affected state due to Covid-19, they do not provide adequate and timely assistance even though all powers rest with them.\u201cThey claim [Covid-19] numbers are fewer in other states, but they are providing more [vaccinations, drugs, oxygen] to such states, but not to Maharashtra. Be it any issue related to Maharashtra, the Centre has always denied its legitimate right. For example, other border disputes of states, which cropped up later, were resolved but not the Belgaum border issue,\u201d Sawant said.Party\u2019s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut claimed that if Maharashtra is deprived of assistance, it will hurt the economy of the country. \u201cPM and Union home minister Amit Shah should give equal attention to Maharashtra as they give to other states, because this is also a part of the country. The manner in which Maharashtra is being treated raises question whether this is an attempt to disrupt the state\u2019s economy. If it is being done during coronavirus [pandemic], then it is vicious and unfortunate,\u201d he told reporters earlier on Tuesday.Earlier this month, the Union ministers and those from the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) were engaged in a war of words over the issue of vaccination. MVA ministers said that they had run out of vaccines, leading to the closure of several centres. The Union ministers hit back stating that adequate doses had been provided to the state. Subsequently, the state and Centre clashed over Remdesivir and oxygen supply.For the Shiv Sena, which was established in 1966 to take up the issues of the Marathi-speaking population in Mumbai and Maharashtra, the agenda remains at its core, even though the party had adopted the larger issue of Hindutva to reach out to a wider audience. The Hindutva thread of the party, however, has been questioned after it junked the alliance with BJP and joined hands with Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress \u2013 parties that are termed secular \u2013 in November 2019.Besides wooing the Gujarati, Jain and Marwari communities, Sena seems to be consolidating its traditional voter base of middle-class Marathi population, which could split to Raj Thackeray\u2019s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) in BMC polls, thereby likely benefitting BJP.Earlier this month, Shiv Sena extended support to Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) candidate Shubham Shelke in the bypoll on the Belgaum seat. During the two-day campaign visit to the city, Raut took on Maharashtra\u2019s BJP leaders for campaigning against Shelke, a candidate from an outfit that has been fighting for the regions\u2019 unification with Maharashtra for five decades. As Union minister and senior BJP leader from Maharashtra Nitin Gadkari and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis campaigned in Belgaum last week, Sena said they have \u201ccheated\u201d the Marathi people of the state.Referring to Fadnavis, Raut said, \u201cAt least Marathi politicians from Maharashtra should not campaign against a Marathi candidate in Belgaum. \u201cFadnavis has been a former Maharashtra CM. During his tenure, MES leaders had met him and he had assured them that the Maharashtra government and BJP were firmly with MES on the merger of the Marathi-speaking areas in Karnataka into Maharashtra. But he is taking a different stand now.\u201dEchoing Raut\u2019s views, Sawant said, \u201cLook at BJP\u2019s stand now. When he [Fadnavis] was CM, he had passed resolutions, but now campaigned against the people he vowed to support. Now everybody knows that they [BJP] are not for the Marathi people and the people of Belgaum.\u201dHe added that Uddhav Thackeray has spoken firmly on the integration of Belgaum. \u201cThis is not a political stand of the party but a thread we share with Marathi people. In 1969, we agitated [for integration of Marathi-speaking areas with Maharashtra] and lost around 69 people. [Late Shiv Sena supremo] Balasaheb [Thackeray] was behind bars for three months for the same issue. The issues of Marathi people will remain at the core of Shiv Sena,\u201d he said.In his weekly column published on Sunday, Raut wrote that the entire Marathi community has united under the saffron flag after a long time, during the bypoll for 26-year-old Shelke. He added that the community has been fighting for their \u201crights and to preserve their culture\u201d for decades but \u201cneither the Centre nor the courts are giving them justice.\u201d\u201cThe apathy of Maharashtra\u2019s politicians is weakening the fight\u2026 Former CM Fadnavis, under whose leadership the resolution on the unification of Belgaum-Karwar region with Maharashtra was passed, went to Belgaum to campaign against Ekikaran Samiti\u2019s Marathi candidate. This is the misfortune of entire Maharashtra. He could have avoided going to Belgaum,\u201d Raut wrote in his column.Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said Shiv Sena has remained consistent in its stand on the Belgaum issue. However, the timing is crucial. \u201cSena over the years has been vocal about the border issue. So, there are no surprises there. However, the political language at this juncture will have an influence in the future. They have showed that they have not forgotten its core ideology. The political messaging will be carried forward, with BMC elections around nine to 10 months away,\u201d said Jondhale, a former professor of political science at the Mumbai University.Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that Sena has forgotten the cause of Marathi manoos for the sake of power.\u201c The Sena and its allies are blaming the Centre for its failure to handle the Covid-19 pandemic in Maharashtra. Last year, the Covid situation was new for everybody. Yet, the central government provide all assistance to the states. [But] In the past nine months, what planning did the MVA government do for beds, oxygen, Remdesivir? Nothing. Their focus was on reinstating [former cop] Sachin Vaze and raise 100 crore. Besides, the Sena had long-forgotten the cause of Marathi people for the sake of power. They are merely raking up the issue from Belgaum, but in reality what have they done?\u201d asked Upadhye."},

Subsequently, it asked states to make sure there are no restrictions imposed on oxygen manufacturers and suppliers to limit the supplies only to hospitals of the respective state.\u201cThere shall be free movement of oxygen carrying vehicles into the cities, without any restriction of timings, while also enabling inter-city supply without any restriction,\u201d the order said.The Centre has already prohibited supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, except those (nine specified industries) exempted by the government beginning Thursday.The order highlighted that medical oxygen is an essential public health commodity and any impediment in its supplies has the potential to critically impact the management of patients suffering from coronavirus disease in other parts of the country.The Centre announced on Wednesday evening that it was increasing the quota of oxygen in eight states, including Delhi, in view of the sudden spike in demand due to an exponential rise in the number of Covid-19 patients admitted in hospitals."},

The court\u2019s observation came after the state government informed that there is no shortage of oxygen or Remdesivir, a drug used in treatment of Covid-19 patients.The court had taken suo-motu cognizance of reports that the Centre had diverted supply of oxygen to other states without the consent of the Tamil Nadu government, and shortage of the antiviral drug. \u201cWe are one country. If we have the resources here, we must share it,\u201d a bench comprising chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said. The bench, however, raised concerns over the new pricing of Covid-19 vaccines and the financial burden it would cause on lower income groups. The observation also came shortly before the Supreme Court took suo-motu cognisance of the prevailing Covid-19 situation and sought a \u201cnational plan\u201d to fight various issues on Friday. Earlier in the day, Banerjee had directed advocate general (AG) Vijay Narayan to focus on four areas -- the availability of the antiviral drug, oxygen, ventilators and vaccines. He also directed additional solicitor general (ASG) R Sankaranarayanan, who was representing the Centre, to be present for the hearing at 2.15 pm. During the hearing later, the state government informed the court that Tamil Nadu has a storage capacity of 1,167 tonnes of oxygen with a daily manufacturing capacity of 400 tonnes and that only 250 tonnes were being used for treatment as of now. Additionally, Puducherry has a production capacity of 150 tonnes, it added.\u201cRecently, about 65 tonnes of oxygen were diverted from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana but it did not affect our capacity at all,\u201d the AG said. Out of 9,600 ventilators, 5,887 are earmarked for Covid-19 treatment in government hospitals. On the other hand, 3,000 ventilators are available in private hospitals. 3,10,000 vials of Remdesivir which is more than enough to meet contingencies, he added. The government also said that it is prepared to face any emergency and that a contingency plan was being prepared in case of an unforeseen situation. At present, there is no shortage in the four areas, it added. Taking note of the new pricing for vaccines announced by the Serum Institute of India (SII), the court asked the ASG to consider the financial burden it would cause on the citizens. On Wednesday, the SII, which locally manufactures the Covishield vaccine, fixed the price at 400 for government and 600 for private players per dose. \u201cIf the people do not take the vaccine, they will continue to remain as carriers and spreaders,\u201d the bench said, taking into consideration that all those above 18 years of age would be eligible for the jab from May 1. It also urged the Centre to consider the requirements of the less privileged and those without basic resources and adequate jobs in the wake of the 2020 lockdown.Besides this, the court called for special measures to ensure minimum spread during Ramzan and on May 2 when counting of votes for the April 6 assembly elections will be conducted. The court said it was not interfering in the state\u2019s functioning but wanted to ensure stricts measures were in place to tackle any emergency situation.

The court also stressed on the need for a faster way of testing, asking the state whether RT-PCR tests could be made more affordable and accessible to all.Addressing the issue of availability of beds, both Kumbhakoni and senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC submitted there were sufficient beds in the state and statistics showed there were more beds than existing patients. \u201cThe shortage is because the middle class and upper class are now affected and they want a bed in a hospital of their choice. When the same is not available, it is depicted as shortage, while closeby hospitals may have vacant beds,\u201d said Kumbhakoni. The court accepted the suggestions of Purohit and advocate Rajesh Inamdar, for an intervener, on the use of print and electronic media to spread awareness on the measures and to curb panic.The court also sought to know from the state the effects of Covid-19 on smokers and said that till the virus is not eradicated, the state and the Centre should consider banning smoking and consumption of tobacco products. Reacting to the Nashik oxygen leak that claimed 24 lives on Wednesday, the court said, \u201cHow can this happen in a civilised society? While the oxygen supply is less, there is leakage. It is of concern. This is not what we expect from a responsible government.\u201d The HC said the Centre and the state should set aside politicking and concentrate on tackling the problems. The court scheduled the next hearing for May 6. "},

We continue to be in discussions with the government and remain committed to make our vaccine available for deployment in India\u2019s immunisation program,\u201d a statement by the company read.The company said that it was interested in working exclusively with the government.\u201cDuring the current pandemic situation worldwide, Pfizer has maintained that its priority would be to exclusively support governments through supply of its vaccine only to governments for their immunisation programs. This would be our approach in India as well,\u201d the statement added.On April 13, India announced that Covid-19 vaccines cleared for use in the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan will get fast-track approval in India, and would not need prior bridging trial results to seek emergency use authorization (EUA). The trials can be done in parallel to administering the shots to the general population..The move is expected to potentially boost India\u2019s pandemic response when it has recorded the world\u2019s worst surge in infections.At present, there are vaccines by three companies that are approved by regulators identified by the government and are yet to be authorised in India: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson&Johnson. A fourth vaccine, made by Novavax, has made progress in clinical trials and sought approval from several of these regulators.Pfizer said it will continue talks with the Indian government on the matter.\u201cWe have noted the recent announcement with regard to the regulatory pathway for global vaccines. We remain committed to continuing our engagement with the government towards making the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine available for use in the government\u2019s immunisation program in the country.\u201dThe company also denied some reports citing a price for American vaccines in India. \u201cIn all our agreements Pfizer has adopted a distinct pricing structure for high, middle, and low/lower-middle-income countries consistent with our commitment to work towards equitable and affordable access for our Covid-19 vaccine for people around the world,\u201d the company said.Despite being the first company to have applied for EUA of its Covid-19 vaccine on December 7, Pfizer withdrew its application on February after the national drugs controller did not approve its EUA application and sought additional data.The decision was taken after the central drugs standard control organization (CDSCO) subject expert committee (SEC), on February 3, did not recommend granting approval for want of more data.The company said Pfizer\u2019s priority had been to ensure rapid manufacturing and deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine to cater to the current emergency response scenario.\u201cWe are also mindful of the unique mRNA technology that is being utilized in this vaccine. Given these considerations, Pfizer has created two dedicated supply lines with established vaccine capabilities \u2013 one each in US and Europe\u2026 This will continue to be the company\u2019s strategy for the time being. At this time we are not in discussions for any additional local manufacturing for this vaccine,\u201d the company said.\u201cOnce the pandemic supply phase is over and we enter a phase of regular supplies, Pfizer will certainly evaluate all additional opportunities available. We remain committed to working towards equitable and affordable access for our COVID-19 vaccine for people around the world including in India, and we welcome opportunities to collaborate with the government to fight COVID-19,\u201d the statement further read."},

The National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority and the General Civil Aviation Authority of the UAE announced the temporary suspension of all flights from India and the entry of transit passengers for a period of 10 days from April 25. Cargo flights between the two sides were exempted from the ban.People who transited through India in the past 14 days will also be barred from entering the UAE and the travel ban will be reviewed after 10 days, according to the announcement.The ban will not apply to UAE nationals, diplomatic passport holders, official delegations, and \u201cgolden residency\u201d visa holders, though they will be required to take further preventive measures such as a 10-day quarantine and a RT-PCR test at the airport. Flights between Indian cities and Dubai have been among the busiest routes even during the pandemic as the UAE is home to more than three million Indians, one of the largest concentrations of expatriates in West Asia. On Thursday, Singapore further tightened restrictions for travellers from India, mainly to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in its crowded workers\u2019 dormitories. Officials acknowledged that the move would impact the construction and marine sectors, which employ a large number of people from India and other South Asian countries. The UAE became the third country after the UK and Oman to bar the entry of Indian nationals even as the daily infections surged past the 300,000-mark. On Wednesday, Oman barred the entry of travellers from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh from April 24. The ban will also cover travellers who transited through any of the three South Asian countries over the past 14 days, Oman\u2019s Supreme Committee announced. The Australian government has decided to temporarily reduce the number of flights from India by 30% after registering a spike in incoming travellers testing positive for Covid-19. People coming from high-risk countries such as India will also have to test negative for Covid-19 at least 72 hours before boarding a flight to Australia.

The move follows the Howard Springs quarantine facility dealing with the highest number of Covid-19 cases since it began handling repatriation flights last year, with most cases recorded among arrivals from India. Singapore on Thursday announced that all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with a history of travel to India within the last 14 days wouldn\u2019t be allowed entry into the country from April 24.

The extended night curfew and weekend restrictions announced by the government on Tuesday has dealt a harsh blow on the food cart vendor businesses, which were yet to recover from the last year\u2019s lockdown in the city. \u201cOur business starts only after 7-8 pm. We especially cater to those who come into town late after finishing work and want food, especially bachelors and others like delivery boys, cab, auto, and bus drivers among others. There is no section that does not come to us for food,\u201d Kumar said. Food cart vendors, who serve dishes like egg rice, kebabs, tea and other condiments after dusk, said their businesses have come down by as much as 80%, adding that the new restrictions will further cripple their sole source of income. The BS Yediyurappa-led government, which announced fresh restrictions to contain the surging Covid-19 cases, has allowed food delivery from hotels and restaurants during the curfew hours, but has barely taken into consideration these vendors who feed the thriving gig economy of Bengaluru, said food experts. The government has tried to mitigate the hardships of those forced to stay back at home by allowing food and grocery delivery, fuel stations, cabs, buses and autos, medical stores, private security guards, ambulance and hospital staff among others. But the food carts, which offer a lifeline to workers in these sectors beyond regular hours, have neither got the permission to remain open nor received any financial compensation from the government this time or during the previous lockdown, they added. \u201cOur business begins only after 8 pm. So, when the government order is for closure at 9 pm, we have to start closing by around 7.30 pm. Almost 80% of our business has vanished. Whether it is a night curfew or a lockdown or a weekend curfew, it has the same impact on us,\u201d Manju G, another food vendor who has a stall outside the TTMC bus stand, said. The mobile food carts serve food for prices in the range of 30-60 in almost all urban centres of India, outside bus stands, railway stations, IT parks, among others. \u201cA lot of delivery boys from Zomato, Swiggy and cab drivers from Ola and Uber eat from carts like ours,\u201d Kumar added. This section of business is run mostly by families, with each member handling one aspect of the operations like cooking, cleaning, supplies and service. Food vendors are part of a large unorganised economy of Bengaluru and other large urban centres, but the lack of a union or organisation often deprives them of bargaining powers that other sectors may have, said experts. The government announced a slew of relief during the first lockdown for weavers, auto drivers, barbers and construction workers, but an even larger section of people in various professions do not even come in the radar of the administration, vendors and political leaders said. Being aware of the hardships people might endure if a second lockdown was announced, the Yediyurappa government tried to find a middle path with the night and weekend curfew to contain the Covid-19 surge without closure of businesses. \u201cWe have bigger problems than corona,\u201d said Abdul Wahab, a food cart vendor in Frazer Town area in East Bengaluru. Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar said the government has failed. \u201cThe government must first instill courage in people and aid them financially,\u201d he said. Another Congress legislator said several sections of people were barely noticed during the previous lockdown and restrictions even this time. \u201cThe last lockdown was almost inevitable, and we did not have any knowledge or time. We used our savings to survive the lack of income. But this time we don\u2019t know what to do to survive,\u201d Syed Mudabbir Ahmed, an auto driver said. "},

According to top South Block officials, with the IAF\u2019s first Rafale squadron just one short of completion in Ambala, the Chinese have moved their so-called fifth generation fighter J-20 ahead in the Tibet and Xinjiang airbases. The Pakistanis have also moved their Chinese import JF-17 fighter in key forward bases to tackle the clear and present threat of the Rafale fighter. Although the Chinese say the J-20 is the third operational fifth-generation fighter after the US F-22 and F-35, genuine fifth-generation fighters developed by the Americans do not have a canard that further reduces the cross-section of the plane, the officials said. The Chinese J-20 has the same canard as the Rafale, which the IAF calls a 4.5-generation fighter.The has also undergone a change with IAF\u2019s induction of the Rafale as the latter carries the Meteor air-to-air missile, whose range is way beyond any missile the other two forces have in their arsenal. The Hammer and Scalp air-launched cruise missile with a range of over 500km ensures that the adversary will have no early warning as the two weapons can be launched from within Indian territory and beyond visual range.While India could only send three out of five readied fighters from the Merignac Bordeaux airbase in France on Wednesday due to unforeseen reasons, seven more fighters have been lined up for delivery to IAF next month. Although the seven fighters may come in batches of three and four, six of them will be flown to the Hashimara airbase in West Bengal via Ambala. The re-pavement and extension of the main runway at Hashimara, which sits astride the Siliguri corridor, is expected to be completed by this month-end.

In the meeting, it was decided that barricades on one side of the highway at Singhu border will be removed, to give free passage to oxygen tankers, ambulance and other such emergency services,\u201d farmer leader Darshan Pal said.The comments came in the backdrop of several allegations on social media this week that the road blockades on account of farmer agitation were leading to a delay in the movement of oxygen tankers across the state borders. BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh tweeted on Tuesday night that due to the road blockade by protesters at the Ghazipur border, oxygen suppliers were facing difficulties in bringing the tankers to Delhi.\u201c... It is the government that is to be squarely blamed for barricading the roads and obstructing free passage, whereas, at all protest sites, farmers have already left such passage for vehicular movement,\u201d SKM said in a statement.The protesting farmers, however, on Thursday showed no signs of calling off the agitation. \u201cA large convoy of protesters in tractor-trolleys will be leaving from Barwasni in Sonepat district of Haryana for the Singhu Border,\u201d SKM said, adding that this was to ensure that government did not try to remove the farmers on the \u201cpretext\u201d of the Covid-19 surge."},

Provisional turnout stood at 79.09 %, comparatively lower than the polling percentage recorded in the first five phases.

Even the state police are now under the control of the EC,\u201d said TMC spokesperson Snehasish Chakraborty. \u201cThe attack on the state police was an outcome of the instigating speeches by chief minister Mamata Banerjee.

Central paramilitary officers posted in the area dismissed the allegation saying no shots were fired anywhere. The EC sought a report from the local administration as the election watchdog\u2019s police observer, Navin Kumar, rushed to the area. BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy\u2019s son, Subhranshu Roy, who was contesting from Bijpur seat in North 24 Parganas, alleged that bombs were hurled at their supporters.

Shah and chief minister Mamata Banerjee held rallies in districts where polls will be held in the last two phases on April 26 and 29.

Mahender Singh, who is taking oxygen to Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, said that this is his second turn in the past 24 hours and he has been allowed to take 5.5 tonne oxygen on Thursday. Earlier, the joint director of Apollo Hospital, Dr Sangita Reddy, in a tweet had sought urgent help from PM Modi, Union defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union commerce and industries minister Piyush Goyal, saying that an oxygen tanker is waiting outside the gate of Air Liquide Panipat at IOC and the driver of the truck is not being allowed to get in. \u201cHaryana police are stopping the truck and not letting oxygen out of Haryana. Need urgent intervention!\u201d Dr Reddy had tweeted. But a few minutes later, she tweeted, \u201cUpdate: The driver has been allowed inside and hopefully oxygen will be sent out soon.\u201d \u201cFurther to my earlier tweet an appeal once again to the govt to please tag oxygen tank as ambulances and enable quick green corridor movement,\u201d she tweeted. However, officials of Air Liquide Panipat said that they are supplying oxygen as per government schedule and do not have any role in deciding where the oxygen supplies should go first. Earlier, officials the IOC, had said that they will be supplying 150 MT liquid oxygen (10 MT everyday) to Delhi, Haryana and Punjab free of cost. But now, officials, requesting anonymity, said that if required, production and supply will be increased. A tanker carrying liquid oxygen was allegedly stolen by unidentified persons. As per FIR registered on complaint of district drug controller Vijay Raje against unknown accused, a truck had left Air Liquide, Panipat, to supply oxygen at Sirsa on Wednesday, but it did not reach till evening. It was allegedly stolen by an unidentified accused on the way, police said. Matlauda police station in-charge Manjeet Singh said, \u201cA case has been registered under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) against unknown persons and investigation is on.\u201d He said that security at Air Liquide has been increased and documents of all trucks are being examined before they leave. This is the second such incident reported in state in the past two days. On Wednesday, Anil Vij had accused the Delhi government of looting oxygen truck on its way to supply oxygen in Faridabad. "},

The counsel also assured the court that its earlier order of May 2020, mandating reports to be issued within a maximum 48 hours will be implemented.The court was hearing a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, who sought ramping up of tests in the city. The petition, which was disposed of, was revived by the court on Monday, noting that the virus has raised its \u201cugly head\u201d once again and that \u201chealth care infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse\u201d.On Thursday, the court also noted that the number of RT-PCR tests in the city is going down despite the fact that the cases are on a rise.To be sure, the proportion of RT-PCR tests among the overall samples collected over the past two weeks has been 66%, below the 70% number as recommended by the Centre. Overall testing, generally, too has dropped as labs struggle to clear backlogs and deliver test results to patients in time, amid a huge spike in demandOn Thursday, Delhi collected 48,346 samples using the RT-PCR method.In comparison, a week ago, Delhi collected 59,401 samples using the gold standard, and 70,403 samples using the technique two weeks ago.During the proceedings, both the Centre and the Delhi government sparred over the allocation of beds in the hospitals being run by the Union government. The petitioner informed the court that the Centre promised to allocate more beds in its the hospitals on April 20 but they were yet to be allocated.Delhi government\u2019s counsel Rahul Mehra said when the cases were comparatively fewer in November, the Centre allocated them 4,132 beds. He said, currently they have been given around 2,900 beds despite the infection spreading much faster than the last wave. He said that nearly 7,000 beds should be allotted to the Delhi government for the emergency period.Arti Ahuja, additional secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, told the court that they have increased the number of beds. She said that the union government was exploring avenues for augmenting the number of beds with other facilities for mild and patients not requiring oxygen. She also said that the beds being sought by the Delhi government were already occupied.The court observed that the situation has become \u201cprecarious\u201d in the city and people are not getting beds. Justice Sanghi said, \u201cPeople are not getting beds. Please do increase the beds. People are dying on the streets. The cases are four fold, people need hospitalization and the immediate needs have to be met. Forget about the common man on the road, today if I go and stand and ask for a bed, I would not get it.\u201dThe bench asked the Delhi government to explore the possibilities of augmenting hotels with the hospitals and DMs and SDMs are in talks on this with the stakeholder.The high court also asked the Delhi government to explore the possibility of getting public sector undertakings (PSUs) to set up makeshift beds as was being done by some other states to enhance the availability of beds for citizens of the national capital.\u201cWe hope and expect that the Centre will look into the requirements of COVID beds and work to enhance availability,\u201d the court said and asked the governments to file status reports on this.The matter would be now heard on April 26."},

The renewed jump in coronavirus infections in several parts of the country and the associated localised and regional lockdowns add uncertainty to the overall growth outlook,\u201d Das said.Contrast this with the policy statement earlier this month, when the central bank said: \u201cThe renewed jump in  in certain parts of the country and the associated localized lockdowns could dampen the demand for contact-intensive services, restrain growth impulses and prolong the return to normalcy. In such an environment, continued policy support remains necessary.\u201dRBI executive director and MPC member Mridul Saggar, too, raised his pitch on the risks to economic recovery if the new wave of infections is not flattened soon.He added that health policies hold the key to India\u2019s recovery as monetary and fiscal policies have already used most of the space through stimulus measures. \u201cLearning effects on calibrating stringency of restrictions may keep economic costs of the second wave much lower than the first, but still retard full normalization by a quarter or two. Ramping up vaccination, testing and treatment hold the key to protecting economic recovery and health policies have become the first line of defence. Monetary and fiscal policies can only play a second fiddle,\u201d Saggar added in the MPC minutes.RBI deputy governor and the MPC member Michael Patra, who is usually the most hawkish among all members, however, softened his stance. He said the focus remains on reviving the economy.\u201cI would continue to look through the recent elevation in inflation and remain focused on reviving the economy on a path of strong and sustainable growth. An integral part of this approach would be to insulate domestic financial markets from global spillovers and volatility so that congenial financial conditions continue to support growth,\u201d he added.MPC member Jayant Verma said the challenges need time-based forward guidance amid the uncertainties and evolving economic state.Since October the MPC has maintained an accommodative stance \u201cduring the current financial year and into the next financial year\u201d, which is reflective of a time-based forward guidance.\u201cI think it is not prudent to repose excessive faith in forecasts. Instead, the MPC must have the agility and flexibility to respond rapidly and adequately to whatever surprises new data may brings in the future. Time-based guidance is inconsistent with this imperative,\u201d Verma said."},

For the next four and a half hours, the hospital plugged oxygen cylinders to their supply lines so that the 140 Covid-19 patients at the facility could be given the required respiratory support.\u201cWe have been managing patients with reserve oxygen cylinders, refilling them and using them again. We need liquid medical oxygen,\u201d said Dr PK Bharadwaj, chief executive director of Saroj Hospital. The hospital had to stop new admissions and discharge some stable patients. Oxygen replenishments reached the facility at around 3pm.After Max group, Saroj became the second to move court to ensure timely oxygen supply, following which the Delhi high court issued new orders to ensure supplies are made smoothly.The situation was similar at Karkardooma\u2019s which put up a message stating, \u201cwe regret we are stopping admission in the hospital because oxygen supply is not coming.\u201dWith increased oxygen demand, the hospital had been simultaneously using liquid medical oxygen, oxygen cylinders, and a concentrator plant. This left the hospital with hardly any backup.The doctors in the hospital urged patients to leave and look for other hospitals that might take them in. However, with less than 20 ICU beds available and hardly any oxygen beds, they had nowhere to go.\u201cWe discharged seven patients; the others said we will die on the road anyway, it is better to wait here. This is a horrifying situation, I have never seen anything like this in 45 years of my career,\u201d said Dr Sunil Sagar, CEO, Shanti Mukand Hospital.The hospital last received half its required supply of liquid medical oxygen at 02:30 am after a delay of three hours. \u201cMy staff was standing outside waiting for the oxygen tanker. Every time there was some movement on the road, they thought it was the tanker,\u201d he said. The hospital turned down oxygen to its patients to conserve whatever it could till the oxygen arrived. The hospital received supply just in time after having dipped into reserves.Metro hospital in Preet Vihar, which had over 100 Covid-19 patients admitted, had to start moving them to its other centres in Shadipur, Noida and Faridabad after it completely ran out of oxygen. The hospital last received half its supply of medical oxygen on Wednesday night. It has been managing by refilling oxygen cylinders since Thursday afternoon.The crisis has been precipitated by obstruction of supply tankers from Haryana coming to Delhi on Wednesday, which resulted in a critical situation on Thursday, according to a doctor in know of the matter.\u201cThe oxygen reserves at most hospitals are running low because of the increased demand \u2013 hospitals are accommodating more patients than usual and almost all the patients need a lot of oxygen. Most hospitals had around 8 to 10 hours of back-up and would receive supply in time. The situation got worse on Wednesday because of several tankers being stopped by the Haryana government. It was a domino effect that delayed supply to all hospital. This resulted in hospitals having almost no reserves on Thursday,\u201d the doctor said.He added, \u201cIt has become like a game of musical chair \u2013 the oxygen tankers are being diverted to whichever hospital is running out of oxygen. This means, the hospital that was to receive the oxygen also goes into a crisis,\u201d the doctor said.The Delhi government estimated that the city would need around 700 MT of oxygen a day due to the increase in the number of patients with Covid-19. On Wednesday, the Centre increased Delhi\u2019s quota of medical oxygen to 480 MT from 378 MT.Yet, tankers of oxygen that were meant for Delhi hospitals were stopped by administrations from neighbouring states, officials said. \u201cDespite the quota being increased by the Centre, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments are stopping oxygen supply to Delhi. Yesterday, Delhi received 177 MT of oxygen against its quota of 378 MT. I urge the Centre to ensure oxygen reaches us even if paramilitary force needs to be deputed,\u201d said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in a tweet on Thursday evening.The Ministry of Home Affairs had to intervene and order all states to ensure allotted quota of oxygen be allowed to be supplied to states other than where the medical oxygen plants are located.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal too said that he spoke to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and the Centre to facilitate the passage of oxygen. Of the extended quota of oxygen, majority is from Orissa that might take days to arrive, Kejriwal said, adding that he had a word with the state\u2019s chief minister Naveen Patnaik to facilitate \u201clifting of Delhi\u2019s quota of oxygen\u201d from the state.Holy family hospital too received its supply of liquid medical oxygen minutes before its stock would have run out. \u201cWe already had all of our staff scrambling to gather oxygen cylinders and attaching it to the manifold in case the oxygen runs out. We have attached 35 cylinders and are waiting with bated breaths,\u201d said Dr Sumit Ray, medical superintendent of the hospital. The hospital received its supply.Aakash hospital had just 1.5 hours of medical supply when it desperately reached out to authorities on Twitter. \u201cWe have 233 Covid-19 patients admitted with, of which 75 are dependent on oxygen. My whole team is running around but we have no assurance so far,\u201d said Dr Kausar Shah, COO, Aakash group. The hospital managed to get 50 oxygen cylinders from neighbouring hospitals and half a tanker of oxygen just in the nick of time.Action Balaji hospital also raised an alarm when they had about three to four hours of supply. Again they received a tanker of oxygen only after dipping into their reserves, which is like going beyond the red line on a fuel tank.Even Delhi government hospitals weren\u2019t spared of problems, with Rajiv Gandhi superspeciality hospital in Tahirpur receiving its supply of medical oxygen just 30 minutes before it was to run out. The hospital has nearly 500 Covid-19 patients.At night, Sir Ganga Ram hospital again raised an alarm that it had oxygen left for five hours of normal use, meaning lesser time if high flow oxygen is given to Covid-19 patients. The hospital currently has over 500 Covid-19 patients admitted."},

We had only one oxygen cylinder left at that time,\u201d Sabharwal said. The police and the district administration helped the hospital get nine cylinders by 1pm. \u201cHad there been a delay of five minutes, we would have lost two critical Covid patients who were on ventilator support. The lives of other nine patients were also at risk,\u201d said Sabharwal.While the news of big hospitals in the city was being amplified on the social media, several hospitals with low bed capacity have also been struggling to get their regular oxygen supply. Big hospitals use liquid medical oxygen pumped through a gas pipeline in their wards but most hospitals with low bed strength depend on oxygen cylinders that can be attached to the supply line. Delhi\u2019s oxygen requirement has soared to nearly three times of the normal as an unprecedented surge of Covid-19 infections has filled up city hospitals with critical cases. Many of the owners of these hospitals and nursing homes with a bed capacity between 15-100 said with the scarcity of medical oxygen and the week-long curfew has ensured that they have a little chance to get their oxygen stock replenished. Dr RP Singh, medical superintendent of Amarleela Hospital in Janakpuri, said they have stopped taking new patients from Thursday morning. \u201cIt has become difficult to arrange oxygen cylinders. We flagged the oxygen shortage on Wednesday evening but except the police, no other agency came to our rescue. The police could only arrange two cylinders last night. Our regular supplier is able to provide only 3-4 cylinders against our requirement of 40 cylinders,\u201d said .Some other hospital owners said the local oxygen suppliers were either themselves affected by Covid or scared to step out. Dr Pawan Solanki, owner of the 50-bed Dharamveer Solanki Multispeciality Hospital in Rohini, said, \u201cOur main oxygen vendor is in home isolation after testing Covid positive. But he is still managing to deliver us some cylinders. We have at least 10 Covid patients in ICU. Their lives are at risk as we are not getting the adequate supply of oxygen cylinders. We are also worried about legal problems that we may have to face in case of any untoward situation,\u201d said Solanki. HT tried to contact at least four local oxygen vendors. While the cellphones of two of them were switched off, the other two disconnected or did not respond to calls.The management of at least two other hospitals, who did not want to come on record, said the government officials have taken hold of the oxygen refilling plants and are giving priority to government hospitals or bigger private hospitals.On Thursday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia urged the central government to intervene and stop Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments from \u201choarding and monopolising oxygen supply designated for Delhi\u201d. \u201cThere is a fight for oxygen supply and this is because, even after increasing the oxygen quote by Central government, there are some states that are stopping oxygen supply to reach hospitals in Delhi. Several hospitals in Delhi now see a dearth of oxygen supply. There is no oxygen left anymore. I have received many messages from hospitals \u2013 Saroj Hospital, Rathi Hospital, UK Hospital, Jeevan Hospital etc., have informed they don\u2019t have oxygen supply left anymore. Delhi government has been arranging cylinders for these and many other hospitals. Internal arrangements are makeshift arrangements which are not long-term solutions. Government and private hospitals in Delhi have very limited supply of oxygen now,\u201d said Sisodia."},

A high proportion of patients are on supplemental oxygen and under ICU care and this has led to a quantum increase in medical oxygen requirement in various Covid related health establishments\u2026. Consequently, in many cases, the existing contractual arrangements have either been disturbed or the health facility\u2019s oxygen requirement has exceeded the contractual quantity, thereby leading to widespread disruption in the supply chain leading to a precarious situation. Furthermore, local supply side disruptions in the neighbouring states is leading to wide variation in day to day delivery of oxygen to Delhi,\u201d the DDMA order read.From Friday, the Delhi government will issue a daily schedule specifying the oxygen allocation to every healthcare facility in the city, the order said.Stating that the allocation and supply of oxygen within the city will be \u201cstrictly regulated\u201d, the rules stated: \u201cThe allocation order shall supersede any existing contractual arrangements entered into by any facility with any supplier until further orders.\u201dThe DDMA also appointed three IAS officers to oversee the demand-supply chain, the transportation and the grievance redressal mechanism of hospitals.Ashish Verma, OSD in Delhi government\u2019s health department has been asked to ensure proper distribution of oxygen from the suppliers to the hospitals, once the tankers enter the city. Udit Prakash Rai, special secretary (health) has been asked to ensure smooth and seamless movement of tankers up to Delhi borders. He has also been asked to sort out all issues raised by suppliers.Vijay Bidhuri, MD, Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), has been tasked with controlling, coordinating and facilitating the supply of oxygen to all health establishments.\u201cA 24x7 control room shall function under Bidhuri. The control room shall also operate a help desk manned by a SDM level officer and 8 other officers for redressing all the grievances and complaints received from all hospitals (Central govt, state govt and private) within half an hour of the receipt of the grievances and complaints. If the grievances/complaints received are not redressed within half an hour, then it shall be the responsibility of Bidhuri to look into the issues and resolve the same,\u201d the order read.The DDMA also asked the Delhi Police to monitor and control seamless and safe movement of all the oxygen tankers, appointing special commissioner of police Muktesh Chander as the nodal officer provide all help, support and security logistics in respect of movements of all tankers from the manufacturers sites to the various hospitals as per the allocation orders.It also asked all hospitals to appoint an audit committee for supervising and rationalising the use of medical oxygen. These committees will have to collect data on usage and stock of oxygen and submit daily reports. Every hospital has been asked to also appoint a nodal officer who shall be available round the clock for any matter relating to coordination and redressal of grievances pertaining to medical oxygen.The DDMA stated that anyone found violating these rules will be preceded against as per the provisions of sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, and other applicable laws."},

We are making a humble request to the Central government and are ready to even touch their feet. We urge the Centre to provide a maximum supply of oxygen to Maharashtra,\u201d said Tope.Mumbai is currently receiving 235 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, although its daily requirement is 300 MT; Nagpur is getting 155 MT daily, despite its need of 180 MT; Pune needs 375 MT, but can garner just 300 MT daily; while Nashik, which needs 125 MT, gets just 85 MT daily. As of now, the state requires 1,500 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen daily, against its production capacity of 1,250 MT. The state is procuring 300 MT from other states, namely Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Chhattisgarh. The government has requested the Centre to increase the Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) supply from other states to 500 MT daily. It is also expecting 105 MT oxygen by way of Oxygen Express train from Vishakhapatnam.There are reports that many Covid patients who are unable to get oxygen beds are now procuring oxygen cylinders at home as a temporary measure. To deal with the shortage, the state is considering using oxygen being produced at steel and thermal power plants. Tope said that Covid-19 centres can be built near the four thermal plants of Parli, Paras, Koradi and Khaparkheda and oxygen supply can be made by connecting a pipeline."},

The most worrying factor right now is how fast daily cases are multiplying, and how the trajectory is showing no clear signs of approaching a peak.The DRDO is among the organisations that are at the forefront of fighting the second deadly wave of Covid that has ripped through the country. It has so far set up or is in the process of setting up state-of-the-art Covid hospitals in six cities to treat more than 3,100 critical patients, said a second official.The DRDO has set up a 500-bed hospital in Delhi and converted an ESIC hospital into a 500-bed Covid facility in Patna. In addition, hospitals with 450 beds in Lucknow, 750 beds in Varanasi and 900 beds in Ahmedabad are expected to be functional soon. A sixth Covid hospital is being readied in Bihar\u2019s Muzaffarpur.The DRDO has also stepped in to address the oxygen crisis precipitated by the second wave of the disease. It has transferred oxygen generation technology to the industry, which has now started providing oxygen plants to state governments and hospitals, the official said. The Uttar Pradesh government, for instance, has ordered five such plants from Coimbatore-based Trident Pneumatics.The technology transferred to the industry is based on the onboard oxygen generation technology developed for the Tejas light combat aircraft. The oxygen generation plants can produce 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute. \u201cMore plants can be supplied by the industry to cater to the hospital requirements pan-India,\u201d the official said.The DPSUs are also making arrangements to buy oxygen plants for the production and supply of oxygen cylinders at a swift pace.Technology developed by the DRDO for a supplemental oxygen delivery system for soldiers posted in high-altitude areas has also been transferred to the industry, and it will soon be available in the market for use by Covid patients.The Indian Air Force has deployed its aircraft for airlifting medical personnel, oxygen containers, oxygen cylinders, trolleys and essential medicines, an IAF official said.\u201cDoctors and nursing staff were airlifted from Kochi, Mumbai, Vizag and Bengaluru for setting up the DRDO Covid hospital at Delhi. Oxygen containers of the DRDO have also been airlifted from Bengaluru for Covid centres in Delhi,\u201d he said.The armed forces and other wings of the defence ministry can play an important role in the fight against Covid-19, said Lieutenant General BK Chopra (retd), a former director general of the Armed Forces Medical Services.\u201cThey have the manpower, resources and discipline to provide relief in these hard times. The military especially has a culture of quick response, be it enemy action or natural catastrophes. It can do a lot to alleviate the sufferings of our countrymen during the pandemic too,\u201d Chopra said.On April 20, defence minister Rajnath Singh carried out an extensive review of the preparedness of the armed forces and other allied organisations to deal with the surge in Covid infections across the country.At that meeting, Singh asked the DPSUs, the DRDO and others to work on war footing to provide oxygen cylinders and extra beds to civil administration and state governments. The armed forces and other stakeholders were also given the go-ahead to buy medicines and other critical items using their emergency powers.The military is also exploring the possibility of utilising the services of vaccinated retired military personnel to help the civil administration and state governments deal with the grim situation."},

If they are out of food, they should guide the person to the nearest shelter. We maintain records for the purpose of scaling up capacity, if needed.\u201dThe lockdown was imposed from Monday night in the light of the Covid-19 surge that has left the health care infrastructure in the city overburdened, forcing patients to run from pillar to post for hospital beds, oxygen, medicines, etc. \u201cWe urge people to maintain social distancing and adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour when they come to the shelters to collect the meals,\u201d said Vijay Kumar Bidhuri, CEO, Dusib.When the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 24 last year, the city government made similar arrangements for the scores of migrants who were leaving for their native towns and villages, triggered by panic and anxiety about loss of livelihood.Last year, the Delhi government also turned its schools into shelters for the migrants who decided to stay back. The Delhi government also prepared 1 million meals per day during the stringent phase of the lockdown, that lasted for 68 days, which were distributed from the night shelters and \u2018hunger centres\u2019 set up in the 70 assembly constituencies in the city.\u201cThe relief measures undertaken during the lockdown last year was massive. This time, there are fewer people lining up for food. People are scared of Covid-19 now. They are scared of stepping out and queueing. They hear about the deaths and the burden of the disease,\u201d said Rai.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday set up a six-member committee and entrusted it the responsibility of ensuring basic essentials such as food, water, sanitation, shelters and medicines to daily wagers and migrant labourers, including those at construction sites. It also directed the panel to tie up with midday meal contractors for preparing enough meals for thousands of workers and their families.Sunil Kumar Aledia, executive director of the Centre for Holistic Development, an advocacy group that works with homeless and migrant workers in the city, said the government should increase its capacity of preparing meals at the earliest. \u201cGroups of NGOs have set up meal distributing centres in Kashmere Gate, Ramleela Maidan, Sarai Kale Khan and Nizamuddin Basti. A large number of people are still availing food from these centres and complaining they are being denied food at the shelters run by Dusib. Such mismanagement is unacceptable.\u201dWhen contacted, Dusib officials dismissed such claims and said they have not received any complaint of anyone being refused food at the nigh shelters."},

We cannot go to hospitals directly in the present situation and that\u2019s why I tried to book an appointment for a virtual consultation. But it took me two days to reach a doctor. I was told that slots were few due to the unavailability of doctors. I am grateful that my condition did not deteriorate in the meantime but the situation is scary for those having moderate to severe symptoms.\u201dSeveral other Covid-19 patients are facing similar issues. Anamika Kapur, a resident of Green Park, said she placed a request for online consultation with a private hospital for her Covid positive mother on Sunday and did not get a response even after three days. \u201cMy mother\u2019s oxygen saturation dropped to 70 (from an optimum of 95%) in that time. Finally, we had to contact a general physician providing telemedicine services in my locality to start her treatment on Tuesday,\u201d she said.Several hospitals and tele consultation services acknowledged that the facility has been hit by the raging pandemic. Dr Alexander Kuruvilla, chief health strategy officer on digital health app \u2018Practo\u2019, said the number of requests for tele consultation has increased by five times in the last 20 days.\u201cThe spike was mainly for general medicine . There are complaints of unavailability of slots as doctors on board with us are not available -- they are stretched by the existing situation. It was challenging for us to respond to the sudden surge and it takes time to get more doctors on board. The situation is getting better now and it will further improve in the coming days,\u201d he said.Officials at a few private hospitals said they will have to step up measures to meet the increasing demand for over-the-phone consultations. Prashant Singh, Director IT, and CIO at Max Healthcare said the number of patients reaching out for tele consultations has surpassed the number of patients seeking in-person consultations. \u201cOur doctors are fully occupied with Covid patients right now but we do not have any other option other than tele consultations in the present scenario. We have reduced the timing of each slot so that doctors can attend to more patients,\u201d he said.An official at the tele consultation department at Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital in Dwarka said they have prepared roasters for doctors to divide their time between in-person and tele consultations. \u201cWe are trying to connect patients with available doctors on the same day itself. But our doctors are occupied with Covid patients and a few even have Covid cases at home,\u201d said the official.Meanwhile, independent practitioners are also flooded with tele consultation requests. Dr Rachna Kucheria, a general physician in South Delhi, said, \u201cThe number of calls I am getting are unprecedented and 98% of those who call have Covid symptoms. Besides Covid-related queries, I am also getting calls requesting beds and oxygen,\u201d she said.Kucheria, founder of DocGenie Telemedicine, said it is important to strengthen tele consultation services to take the load off the health-care system. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pool together general physicians at the community level to step up tele consultation services. It\u2019s very challenging for doctors to manage hospital patients and telemedicine consults both,\u201d she said."},

During present times, we must make optimum use of resources. Beds cannot be increased if regular oxygen supply is not ensured and as a result patients will keep roaming around in search of beds. There are hospitals which cannot use ICU beds because of lack of oxygen supply. So, people occupying beds without any major symptoms should leave it for others,\u201d said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). \u201cAdministration should gear up and rope in charitable institutions or NGOs for more beds.

The state health department had expressed concern over the surge in daily cases as going by their projection the tally of active cases is likely to go up to 1.1 million cases, which will overwhelm the entire health infrastructure and situation may go out of control. More than 80% health infrastructure is already occupied. As the state is struggling with shortage of oxygen and anti-viral drug such as Remdesivir, ministers insisted on a complete lockdown in the cabinet meeting. \u201cAll shops related to groceries, vegetables, fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries and confectionaries, including those of chicken, mutton, poultry, fish and eggs, have been allowed to operate between 7am and 11am. Home delivery from the said shops; hotels, restaurants and bars and from e-commerce websites have also been allowed till 8pm,\u201d said Aseem Gupta, principal secretary, disaster management and relief and rehabilitation department said. \u201cWe have brought restrictions only on public transport, offices, marriage functions and private vehicles,\u201d he added. The wedding ceremony, which has proved to be a super-spreader event in the past, has been allowed in the presence of only 25 attendees. The ceremony has to be completed in two hours, while flouting of the condition may attract a fine of 50,000 to the family and action against the operator by shutting down the facility till the end of the pandemic. Flouting of rules will attract a fine of 10,000, stated the order. \u201cThe offices from the exempted category, including banks, mediclaim, insurance sector, too, will have to reduce the attendance to 15% from the existing permission of 50%. However, offices dealing in essential services, including hospitals, clinics, pharmaceutical companies, posts, ports, petrol pumps, petroleum companies, e-commerce companies etc. can operate at 50% capacity,\u201d the order said.

On Thursday, these three facilities collectively had 1,390 total beds \u2013 of which 400 beds were equipped with oxygen. As per the government\u2019s augmentation plan, these three centres should have had 1,875 oxygen beds by Tuesday (April 20), said a senior government official.The centre set up at the Radhasoami Satsang Beas\u2019s Chhatarpur campus is vacant right now, despite being reopened on April 20 with 250 beds. In an April 20 order, the Delhi government said the Chhatarpur facility will be attached with Madan Mohan Malviya hospital, which will provide the centre with doctors, nurses, paramedics and at least 10 dedicated ambulances. \u201cThe district administration has not been able to provide the facility with oxygen beds. We plan to reopen the centre again by Saturday with 500 oxygen beds. Oxygen supply is likely to be normalised by then,\u201d said a senior revenue department official. Similarly, plans to run temporary care facilities at the CWG village and Yamuna complex \u2014 that collectively have 1,140 beds, of which 400 are oxygen-equipped \u2014 have also been interrupted by the shortage, which chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia, and health minister Satyendar Jain have flagged repeatedly over the past few days. These two shelters should have had 1,375 beds \u2013 all with oxygen facilities \u2013 by April 20, said the first government official.The care centre in the CWG village was opened on Wednesday with 460 beds, of which 200 have oxygen facilities. Similarly, the centre in Yamuna Sports Complex was also opened on Wednesday, with 680 beds, of which 200 have oxygen facilities. \u201cAll oxygen beds are occupied in the two centres, and we are also facing a major shortage of oxygen. There is little scope of increasing the number of oxygen beds unless the shortage is resolved,\u201d said a senior official in the district administration of east Delhi, where the two centres are located. As Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the lockdown on Monday, he said the curbs would help the state government augment the city\u2019s health care infrastructure, which has been brought to the brink by the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths. Delhi on Thursday added 26,169 cases and 306 deaths. Of the 20,448 Covid-19 beds in the city, 18,282 were occupied as of 7pm, the Delhi Corona app showed. Alarmingly, only 18 of the 4,684 intensive care unit beds were vacant, the portal showed. Delhi\u2019s demand for medical oxygen has nearly tripled due to the devastating surge, with hospitals forced to send out distress calls to authorities, which have pitted the Capital\u2019s government against the administrations in neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, forcing the Centre to intervene. The Centre on Thursday meanwhile ordered that there should be no restrictions on the movement of medical oxygen between states, and that transport authorities shall be instructed to accordingly allow free inter-state movement of vehicles carrying oxygen. However, state officials said they cannot add oxygen beds at Covid care centres till supply bottlenecks are overcome. A Delhi government spokesperson said: \u201cWe have the required infrastructure to augment beds in Covid-19 facilities. The problem is the supply of oxygen. The augmentation plan will face no difficulties if they supply of oxygen is stable. Supply of oxygen across the country is regulated by the central government and every state has an allocated quota. Delhi has been facing a major shortage of medical oxygen. While the central government has increased the state\u2019s allocation to 480 MT (from 378 MT) per day, the city\u2019s current demand is more than 700 MT per day. Secondly, Delhi is also not getting the allocated oxygen because authorities in neighbouring states such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are stopping oxygen tankers, interrupting the supply. We have urged the central government to immediately intervene in this regard. Yesterday, Delhi received only 178 MT oxygen against the old quota of 378 MT.\u201d "},

The attendants of many patients are being asked to shift their patients to another hospital due to a shortage in medical oxygen. This demand and supply gap of oxygen has left many in the lurch. Panna Lal (68), a resident of a colony near Varuna Bridge, took ill on April 12. His Covid test was done and the report came out negative, however, his condition deteriorated. Later, his son prof Anil Kumar Chaudhary admitted him to a Vivek Hospital in the Bhikharipur area of Varanasi on April 16. His condition was detected with pneumonia. On April 17, the hospital administration informed prof Chaudhary that there would be a shortage of oxygen, therefore, he should shift his father to another hospital. Chaudhary said, \u201cI somehow managed to shift my father to Sahyog Hospital and Surgical Centre in Orderly Bazar area. My father is admitted to ICU and his condition is improving. However, on April 22 morning, the hospital administration asked me to shift my father to another hospital since the hospital as there would shortage of oxygen because the hospital was left with oxygen for next few hours only.\u201d He said, \u201cThis information made me shocked because it is not easy to find a hospital under the current circumstances. I raised the issue before the authorities and urged them to ensure oxygen supply to the hospital because there are 12 patients, including my father in the ICU. By afternoon, the hospital received around eight cylinders of oxygen.\u201d Thereafter he took a sigh of relief and thanked the authorities for paying attention to his request. Chaudhary appealed to the authorities to maintain supply to the hospital to avoid inconvenience to the patients in the ICU. Another 40-year-old patient has been admitted to the same hospital on April 18. He is on oxygen support. On Thursday morning, the patient\u2019s kin, who does not wish to be named, said that the hospital authorities asked her to shift the patient to another hospital since the hospital was left with oxygen supply only till noon and there would be a shortage of oxygen. She took a sigh of relief after the hospital got a supply of cylinder in the noon. Not only these two persons but many others in Varanasi are being asked to shift their respective patient to another hospital due to the shortage of medical oxygen. Besides, many people are struggling to get beds with oxygen facility for their ailing kin. District Magistrate Kaushalraj Sharma said, \u201cWe are facing the biggest challenge to remove dearth of oxygen and meet its demand. This time, almost all the people who are getting infected by this deadly form of coronavirus require oxygen.\u201d That is why, beds with oxygen facilities are being increased at the Trauma Centre, BHU. A total of 40 beds have been increased in the trauma centre on Thursday, besides, 15 ventilators have been provided to the BHU so that the general beds can be prepared for Covid patients, said Sharma. He said that all possible efforts are being made to meet the oxygen demand. \u2018Now O2 reserve in hosps remain for 8-10 hrs\u2019 VARANASI District magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said that nowadays, the hospitals in Varanasi have an oxygen reserve of 8-10 hours. Therefore, hospitals should admit the patients as per the availability of oxygen. DM said that a meeting was held with the in-charges of different hospitals on Tuesday. In the meeting, it was told to them that any hospital if facing problems in getting oxygen should reduce the number of beds and not admits new patients till the old patients get discharged. Every hospital should keep only as many patients as fits into its quota of oxygen, he said. The daily Oxygen supply is fixed and around 3400 oxygen cylinders are being supplied to various Covid hospitals. When the oxygen supply will get better, beds can be increased after a few days. We have reached the maximum capacity of beds according to oxygen availability, he added. BOXEmpty O2 cylinders reach Kashi from GujVARANASI Two hundred empty cylinders of oxygen reached Varanasi, said divisional commissioner of Varanasi, Deepak Agarwal, on Thursday. He said that these cylinders will be filled with oxygen and supplied to the hospitals. These cylinders have been brought from Gujarat. He added that 400 more empty cylinders will arrive in Varanasi within the next two days from Gujarat. These cylinders would be filled with oxygen and supplied to the hospitals. The order for these cylinders was placed a few days ago. "},

A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Mumbai-based lawyers Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari seeking directions to the Centre, the state government and BMC to provide door-to-door vaccination facility for people over 75 years of age, the disabled and the bedridden, was informed that the MoHFW had filed an affidavit in response to the court\u2019s direction in the earlier hearing. The affidavit stated that there could not be a door-to-door vaccination policy as it would lead to \u201chigh vaccine wastage and contamination leading to a reduction in efficacy\u201d, and that the protocols on physical distancing and infection prevention, including a 30-minute observation period, would not be followed.The MoHFW affidavit had also stated that in the case of adverse event following immunization (AEFI), there could be a delay in reaching the health facility and managing that case may not be as per requirement. The affidavit also stated it was not mandatory to administer the vaccine close to an intensive care unit ( ICU), \u201cThe occurrence of serious/severe AEFI is very rare, which may not necessarily require admission into ICU. Hence, there is no such requirement for an ICU for the administration of vaccines.\u201dAfter perusing the affidavit the court questioned, \u201cThere are ICUs in ambulances, you cannot keep a refrigerator? Where is the study that shows there will be wastage due to the time taken to reach the beneficiary? We expected a better affidavit with more facts and figures from the Centre. There needs to be a solution. You need to have a relook at it.\u201dWhen additional solicitor general (ASG) Anil Singh for the Union of India submitted that in case of co-morbidities, there would be a risk in door-to-door vaccination to senior citizens. The court observed, \u201cThis is choosing between the devil and the deep sea. You do not want patients with comorbidities to be given vaccines without supervision, but because they cannot come to the vaccination centre, you want them to suffer?... In our country, old people and children should be taken care of on priority...We cannot leave old people to die...It is upon us that our near and dear ones get vaccinated.\u201dThereafter, Kapadia urged the HC to pass orders to waive off mandatory documents like Aadhaar or PAN card for vaccination, however, ASG opposed it and said that some document was required for it. The court then observed, \u201cIf some person is living under the bridge, then will not he/she carry the disease? Then what do we do? Unless you start a drive to get an Aadhar card for everyone.\u201d The court directed the MoHFW to have a relook at its decision and said that it would give \u2018prima facie\u2019 opinions on the five reasons given by the Centre for not being able to have a door-to-door policy for vaccination and posted the hearing of the PIL to May 6.

A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish S Kulkarni issued the directions in the suo motu (on its own) public interest litigation (PIL) on the issue of overcrowding in the state and district jails which had resulted in almost 200 prisoners and 76 prison staff testing positive for Covid in the past month. In the previous hearing on April 20, the court had asked the state government to respond to its concerns over the surge in Covid-19 cases across prisons and provide suggestions on measures to prevent the same. According to the data furnished by the state to the HC about 35,124 prisoners are lodged across 47 jails in Maharashtra, which can house around 23,217 inmates only.

The chart provided by the government is showing the crime rate in 2019 and 2020.\u201d The court granted time to the state government to furnish a relevant response to its query during the next hearing. Thereafter, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the court that the procedure for decongesting jails and transferring prisoners required a judicial order, which the concerned magistrates could decide after hearing the prisoner and prison authority, and pass a reasoned order on the transfer. After senior advocate, Mihir Desai who had represented the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), an NGO which had sought various reliefs for prisoners during the outbreak of coronavirus in jails last year informed the court that transferring prisoners to other prisons could be a good option the bench said, \u201cWe do not doubt in our mind that having regard to the critical situation prevailing now, the state government may to ensure equitable distribution of undertrial prisoners, have to decide upon shifting some of them from overcrowded correctional homes. We have expressed hope and trust that the magistrate decides application as earliest possible, preferably within 48 hours of making such application.\u201d HC will hear the PIL next on Tuesday, April 27.

Referring to a news report from last year which said that people need to be cautious about the spread of Covid till June 2021, the HC said, \u201cHad we not lowered our guard at least till June 30, 2021, this situation would not have arisen.\u201d \u201cYou should realise this is an emergency situation,\u201d said the bench, adding that black-marketing and profiteering should also be stopped. With regards to availability of Covid-19 tests, the state submitted the concerns and suggestions of advocate Simil Purohit for the petitioner to allow more labs for testing and having a uniform rate for the medicines would be considered. The court also stressed on the need for a faster way of testing, asking the state whether the RT-PCR tests could be made more affordable and accessible to all.Addressing the issue of availability of beds, both Kumbhakoni and senior advocate Anil Sakhare for the BMC submitted there were sufficient beds in the state and statistics showed there were more beds than existing patients. \u201cThe shortage is because the middle class and upper class are now affected and they want a bed in a hospital of their choice. When the same is not available, it is depicted as shortage, while closeby hospitals may have vacant beds,\u201d said Kumbhakoni. The court accepted the suggestions of Purohit and advocate Rajesh Inamdar, for an intervener, on the use of print and electronic media to spread awareness on the measures and to curb panic.The court also sought to know from the state the effects of Covid-19 on smokers and said that till the virus was not eradicated completely, the state and Centre should consider banning smoking and consumption of tobacco products. Reacting to the Nashik oxygen leak that claimed 24 lives on Wednesday, the court said, \u201cHow can this happen in a civilised society? While the oxygen supply is less, there is leakage. It is of concern. This is not what we expect from a responsible government.\u201d The HC said the Centre and state should set aside politicking and concentrate on tackling the problems. The court has scheduled the next hearing on May 6. "},

In a bid to regulate the charges of cremation at the ghats, the administration has fixed the fee of cremation to 4000 including that of wood. The steps have been taken after reports that people were being charged hefty amounts for the cremation of the bodies of their kin started floating on social media. A video had also gone viral in which the person responsible for giving woods at Phaphamau Ghat was asking a family to pay a hefty amount. The police reached the scene after the family created a ruckus when they were allegedly stopped from cremating the body themselves. After the incident, two more persons were given the responsibility to supply wood at the ghat.It is worth mentioning that due to the large number of bodies coming in for cremation the family of deceased persons were charged 7000 and even more in the name of giving wood. The extra fee was causing scuffles at the ghat after which cops were deployed there.ADM (nazul) Gangaram Gupta said charges for wood have been fixed at 4000. No wood supplier can charge more than this amount. If any person is asked to pay more than the fixed amount then a complaint can be made in this connection. Strict action will be taken on such complaints, he added. "},

The burden on government vaccination centres has increased as there are frequent closures of vaccination centres and many private hospitals have discontinued vaccination owing to shortage of stock.On Thursday, 48 private vaccination centres were shut owing to shortage of vaccine doses. As a result, long queues were seen outside civic-run vaccination centres. The scene was the same on Wednesday when around 40 of the total 129 vaccination centres could not carry out vaccination. Several jumbo centres like Dahisar Jumbo Centre, NESCO and civic hospitals in the city are witnessing long queues for vaccination.The daily number of people being vaccinated has come down to 25,000 to 40,000 from 50,000 to 60,000 about two weeks ago.Ashish Mhatre, a Dahisar resident said, \u201cI had gone to Dahisar Jumbo Centre for vaccination, but there was a long queue and no social distancing was followed. I will now register and go at a later stage after taking a prior appointment.\u201dThe BMC on the other hand aims to have 500 vaccination centres in the city in the coming months, as vaccination for everyone above 18 years of age starts from May 1, 2021. As of Wednesday morning, the BMC had around 180,000 vaccines in stock that may go down to around 100,000 by Friday morning. On Thursday, 48,152 citizens were vaccinated of which 21,762 were senior citizens above the age of 60, 22,104 were between the age group of 45 to 60, 1,491 were health care workers and 2,795 were front line workers. Overall, 2,128,095 of citizens have been vaccinated in the city, so far. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, \u201cWe have been getting vaccine doses from the Centre, but they are not in bulk.\u201d The BMC has a storage capacity of stocking around 12 million vaccine doses at the central vaccine storage facility in Kanjurmarg, and the same is expected to be utilised starting May 1. Meanwhile, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, city-based physician said, \u201cThe crowding in the form of long queues outside civic vaccination centres will only prove dangerous considering the virus is mutating and its new variants are spreading faster. In all this, the long queues outside vaccination centres only add to the spread.\u201d"}
