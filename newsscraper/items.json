Over a dozen bodies were found floating in the Ganga in Bara and Gahmar areas of Ghazipur district on Monday. Similarly, more than two dozen bodies were found from Ujiyar Ghat and Bharauli area of Ballia district on Tuesday. Ghazipur administration has initiated a probe into the matter. \u201cOur officials are present on the spot and an investigation is underway. We are trying to find out from where these bodies came,\u201d district magistrate of Ghazipur MP Singh said. It came to light when local people, traumatised by the sight of floating human bodies in the Ganga and fearing spreading of diseases in the area, informed the district administration officials. Bara town in Ghazipur district shares boundary with Buxar district of Bihar. It is just two kilometres from Gahmar (Ghazipur). \u201cThe bodies, found in Gahmar and Bara stretch of Ganga, are different from those found in Buxar of Bihar,\u201d said a Local.Former village head of Gahmar Durga Prasad Chaurasia said that over a dozen bodies were seen floating. Thereafter, locals informed administrative officials. A team of administrative officials reached the spot and initiated a probe, he said. \u201cI received information that two bodies were floating in the Ganga in Bara area of Ghazipur. I along with my team reached the spot and found that two bodies floating in the river. This is a matter of grave concern,\u201d said Ramesh Kumar Maurya, sub divisional magistrate of Sevrai division, who reached the spot along with his team on Monday evening. Maurya said that he had no idea from where the two bodies came. He said that the bodies appeared to be a fortnight old. Maurya, however, refused to comment on Buxar administration\u2019s claim that the bodies found in the Ganga in Buxar had come from UP\u2019s side. A senior police official, not willing to be named, said a vigil would be maintained along the river stretch in Gahmar area of the district. At the same time, the locals have been asked to inform police in case they see anyone immersing a body in the river. Meanwhile, a social worker and village head of Mubarakpur in Ghazipur district, Shyamnarayan Singh said that he heard that a few bodies (four bodies) were immersed in the Ganga by the families of the dead as they couldn\u2019t afford to buy wood required for cremation. \u201cSuch incidents are being reported for the last one week from several villages in the area,\u201d he claimed. Ex-village head of Gahmar Gahmar Durga Chaurasia also backed it. \u201cIn rural pocket, this has been taking place for the last one week,\u201d he said. Over two dozen bodies were also found floating in the Ganga at Ujiyar Ghat and Bharauli area of Ballia district, locals said. On being informed by locals, a team of administrative officials along with police personnel reached the spot and took out six bodies from the Ganga\u2019s Bharauli stretch, and remaining from Ujiyar area, according to reports. According to ANI, Ballia district magistrate Aditi Singh said few bodies were found near the banks of the river Ganga under the Ballia-Buxar bridge last evening. Last rites of these bodies were performed by police and local administration. The incident of corpses floating in Bihar has sparked fears about the scale of the Covid crisis in the country. Authorities believe the relatives of those succumbed to the virus may not have been able to find space for the last rites. On Tuesday, Union minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat had termed the incident as \u201cunfortunate\u201d and asked concerned states to take immediate cognizance. \u201cThe incident of corpses found floating in the Ganga in Buxar region of Bihar is unfortunate. This is definitely a matter of investigation. The Modi government is committed to the cleanliness \u2018mother\u2019 Ganga. This incident is unexpected. The concerned states should take immediate cognizance in this regard,\u201d Shekhawat tweeted. (With agency input)"}

Over the course of more than two centuries, the Swiss institution has discreetly tended to the assets of the very\u00a0rich, led by a small crop of partners who form the most exclusive men-only club anywhere outside the Vatican.In its entire history, only 43 individuals \u2014 all men, all white \u2014 have risen to the rank of Pictet managing partner, creating a bond more enduring than your typical marriage. From their Geneva perch, they\u00a0oversee more than 600 billion francs ($662 billion) in assets under management and a level of profitability far beyond larger, publicly-listed peers, often rewarding each of them with more than 20 million francs a year.\u00a0\u00a0But in recent years, an unsettling new trend crept into Pictet, cracking the fa\u00e7ade of corporate cohesion: key employees began leaving. Over the course of 2019, a dozen long-tenured relationship managers at the wealth unit\u00a0departed. Within days in September of that year, four leading bankers from the team looking after Russian clients handed in their resignations.\u00a0Bankers for Scandinavia and Israel followed, putting billions in assets under management at stake.At the heart of the exodus lies\u00a0a culture clash.\u00a0Longtime employees were bristling at the brash style\u00a0of the flood of recent hires brought on to manage the money of the ultra rich, particularly the explosive growth of new wealth in Asia that has set off an aggressive race for assets and talent with bigger rivals like UBS Group AG\u00a0and HSBC Holdings Plc.Yet for others, change wasn\u2019t happening fast enough;\u00a0some newcomers who had signed up to the promise of the\u00a0rejuvenated Pictet\u00a0were departing again in frustration.Interviews with a dozen people familiar with Pictet\u2019s private-wealth arm reveal a business at a crossroads, confronted with the reality that, in order to stay ahead, Switzerland\u2019s preeminent private bank must adapt. That means embracing more risk and changing the client relationship \u2014\u00a0away from\u00a0the concierge-like approach\u00a0that endured for generations toward a more transactional model.That can be tough for employees accustomed to the principle of caution and secrecy that guided Pictet through the centuries. But change has also brought opportunity to rethink old habits and expand the bank on the global stage.The people asked not to be identified discussing the bank\u2019s\u00a0inner workings. Pictet declined to comment for this story.While overall attrition at Pictet Wealth Management stands\u00a0at an all-time\u00a0low of 2.8%, the\u00a0evacuation of longtime talent has reverberated through\u00a0the corridors of the five-story modernist headquarters. The departures startled the partners, who viewed the outflow\u00a0as an assault on an institution priding itself in flat fluctuation. So late in 2019, they gathered in a spartan conference room for what the partners call\u00a0their salon meeting\u00a0to learn more about what was behind the defections.Sitting in tiered formation at the large conference table, much in the same way they congregate several times a week to discuss the order of business, the men heard\u00a0of tensions, a dispute over restraint\u00a0and renewal\u00a0rippling through the bank\u2019s private wealth subsidiary.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cPictet is in between two worlds,\u201d says Pedro Araujo, a senior researcher at the University of Fribourg, who has studied Switzerland\u2019s elite families. \u201cThey are in the old world of Geneva private bankers, and the new world of globalized finance, where they want to be present internationally, they want to grow, they want to present themselves as modern, but not too much. Two worlds that are on a collision course.\u201dFor all its tradition, Pictet has become more attuned to change in recent years. The company transformed\u00a0its legal status after the end\u00a0of banking secrecy in 2014, disclosing more performance metrics as a result. One of its partners, R\u00e9my Best, had already made his mark revamping the asset-management unit. Next, he\u00a0turned\u00a0his attention to\u00a0the wealth division, long the beating heart of Pictet.\u00a0It turned out that the operation required\u00a0fresh blood. And the bank found it in\u00a0Boris Collardi, who performed one of the most audacious maneuvers in Swiss banking in 2018 when he abruptly left as CEO of Zurich private-banking nemesis Julius Baer and decamped to the shores of Lake Geneva to join Pictet.On the face of it, Collardi is everything that the typical Pictet stakeholder is not. More bonvivant than ascetic financier, Collardi, 46, stands apart as the first outside partner in decades. He also brought serious star power and a dose of bonhomie to the Pictet franchise that values uniformity over individualism, down to the subdued color palette of the partners\u2019 perfectly tailored suits.Collardi, by contrast, is known to greet\u00a0close colleagues with a hug or a peck on the cheek; in meetings, he is the first to take off his suit jacket and jokingly complains about having to wear a tie. His ascent to the Pictet partnership not only made him one of the youngest people in recent history\u00a0to hold that title, it also tipped the scale for the first time to a majority of members\u00a0in the group who aren\u2019t\u00a0descendants of the founding families.In Collardi, the partners identified\u00a0a peer\u00a0who could pick up from Best,\u00a0a longtime acquaintance who had introduced the new hire to the other partners. And Collardi was already well versed in Asia, where Pictet was keen to tap\u00a0into an affluent class of newly minted billionaires preparing to pass on their wealth to the next generation.But Collardi also had to adjust to the new reality of no longer being the undisputed leader. Instead, he is now one voice among seven, where every decision is made in unison.\u00a0The weekly meetings\u00a0are presided over by senior partner Renaud de Planta, who declined to comment for this story.\u00a0Given that the average tenure of an active\u00a0partner is 20 years, collegial harmony is the glue that holds together the senior team.\u00a0That hasn\u2019t stopped Collardi from moving swiftly in his new role. Within a year, more than 100 of his loyalists had followed him to Pictet, including close to the complete\u00a0teams for the Middle East and Latin America.Collardi also accelerated an overhaul of the investment and trading platforms, replacing some of the longest-serving portfolio managers with investment advisers half their age.\u00a0By the end of 2020, Pictet's wealth bankers had swelled to 1,098 from 740 just five years earlier, an expansion not dissimilar to absorbing a full-blown acquisition.\u00a0The changes echo the overhaul that Collardi enacted at Julius Baer. Over the course of a decade, he turbo-charged the storied private bank, sending it on a breakneck expansion from Sao Paulo to Singapore, doubling assets under management as a result. But despite his meteoric rise, Collardi remained, by his own account at the time of the move, \u201conly an employee.\u201d Pictet, by contrast, offered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become an entrepreneur\u00a0with extra financial legroom\u00a0but without the\u00a0daily grind of running a publicly-listed company.\u00a0Making Pictet partner brings a stake in a steady business whose owners share in more than 500 million francs in annual profit.\u00a0Up until a few years ago, the firm was so old-fashioned that managing partners were expected to be addressed as Notre Sieur, a formal French title for sire.\u00a0The challenge facing the partners is that in order to grow, they need to aggressively target Asia, the epicenter of wealth creation. But that requires the embrace of new \u2014\u00a0and potentially riskier \u2014\u00a0investment assets, chief among them structured products, which use derivatives to track the performance of an underlying asset.Collardi spent more than a year trying to win backing from the other partners to push Pictet to sell its own products in that asset class. The others weren\u2019t convinced, priding themselves in their track record of never having endured a defaulted loan. The project\u00a0was watered down in early 2020 and Pictet settled for the less-risky option of being a broker selling other bank\u2019s structured products.Asia has nevertheless remained an important focus for Collardi\u2019s reorganization, where he wants to break into the ranks of the top 10 private banks. For now, Pictet is\u00a0willing to wait for clients to\u00a0come to the bank\u00a0once they are ready for a\u00a0risk-averse approach to wealth management.\u00a0Collardi appointed Fong Seng Tee, a banker he knew from his time at Credit Suisse Group AG, as the head\u00a0for the wealth arm\u2019s Asia division, pushing the existing leader\u00a0into a more ceremonial chairmanship position. He\u00a0also brought an ally over from Baer to run a new Middle East region, stripping the territory from the longtime banker\u00a0who oversaw the wealth business for Greece, Turkey and the Middle East.While Pictet has steadily grown over the years, it has so far avoided the tense\u00a0transitions to a\u00a0modernized corporate structure embraced by other well-known former partnerships, notably Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Lazard Ltd.\u00a0\u00a0Pictet may\u00a0still be much smaller than publicly-listed wealth managers, but the bank packs a punch when it comes to profitability. Pictet long managed to achieve a return on equity above 40%, a number that's unheard of for any modern bank. While the figure has come down to between 16% and 21% in the past half decade, it's still a cut above UBS, Credit Suisse and Julius Baer.The transformation in 2014 into a limited partnership removed\u00a0the risk of the partners bearing the full brunt of losses. As a result of the change in legal status, Pictet began publicly disclosing performance data.\u00a0Suddenly, Pictet was forced to reckon with its haphazard organization\u00a0that often\u00a0put personal relationships before a systematic structure. Until then, it wasn\u2019t unusual for bankers to act independently with no uniform approach to clients, for example sending out correspondence using their own fonts and letterheads. Among historic quirks, some employees didn\u2019t\u00a0have a formal work contract \u2014\u00a0joining the bank was a social compact with a benevolent patriarchy holding a\u00a0protective hand over its flock.\u00a0Pictet embarked on a long march into the 21st Century, guided by one of its partners. A former McKinsey executive, R\u00e9my Best was attuned to performance metrics and organizational optimization. Fresh from turning Pictet\u2019s asset management arm into a metric-minded profit generator, Best next set his eyes on wealth management, long a protected sanctuary at Pictet because it used to bring in the bulk of money.The bank took a hard look at which private wealth customers were bringing in the lion\u2019s share\u00a0of revenue, realizing that some were costing Pictet too much, while others still should be targeted more aggressively to buy more services.Best\u2019s forensic approach caused a stir among employees. Pictet\u2019s private bankers hadn\u2019t previously been\u00a0required to disclose their clients, or say how much money they were making for the bank. Personal customer relationships gave way to faceless scorecards measuring net new money, return on assets, and whether bankers met growth targets.The details were made available to an army of internal business managers poring over the numbers, often re-assigning clients by funneling them into categories based on wealth, location and level of activity with the bank.\u00a0Some individual bankers lost coveted clients to new teams with regional focuses, and others bristled at what they saw as an\u00a0unvarnished style of the newer hires. Still others threw up their hands and decided to leave.The tone of modern corporate efficiency can grate in a firm where former managing partner Nicolas Pictet once\u00a0told his employees that retaining a client was more important than making a profit. The company has also grown past the point where partners could regularly act as rainmakers on a hard-fought deal or bringing on a big client.But as owners of a private partnership, they still stand apart from the rank-and-file.\u00a0After all, a confidential calculation determines how much profit is kept for the partners and how much is distributed to the rest of the bank to support the firm\u2019s entire equity structure.\u00a0\u00a0Each time a partner joins the reigning fellowship, he is required to purchase a substantial stake of the company. To finance the transaction, existing partners provide a loan to their newest member, who pays them back over time. A departing partner must start selling his share back to the bank. To support this ebb and flow of stakes, the bank aims for a\u00a0minimum 20% return on equity.Maintaining that level has become harder amid mounting competition and higher compliance costs. When profitability has dropped below 20%, employees have felt the pain in their personal compensation, which contains a variable component tied to the annual results. That, in turn, has led to a growing divide between average employees and the partners, who have continued to enjoy their steady inflow.During a\u00a0presentation in February, a cherished Pictet ritual\u00a0held online for the first time this year, de Planta laid out last year\u2019s key numbers. The bank was buoyed like many others by the market volatility the pandemic provided \u2014 from the boom in investing revenue to a rebound in variable compensation for employees and a record number of assets under management as clients sought safety.But while the partners spoke at length about performance, charitable efforts or Pictet\u2019s gleaming new building slowly rising on the outskirts of Geneva, one member from their group remained conspicuously absent: Collardi didn\u2019t speak or show once during the presentation.Instead, the man most associated with Pictet\u2019s turbulent\u00a0last years\u00a0had slipped into the background."}

Abid Ali\u2019s hopes were shattered as Covid-19 started claiming lives of people. Although none in his family was infected with Covid-19, Abid Ali and his family members were shocked over the large number of deaths, including many in their locality and in their extended family. Upset by the tragedy, the family has decided not to wear new clothes this Eid.Many local leaders and religious heads have also urged community members to mark Eid with simplicity and focus on helping the needy around them who are still fighting for survival.Imam Jama Masjid and former Sheher Qazi Sayyad Maqbool Hussain urged Muslims to offer Eid-ul-Fitr prayers at home.

With the strict implementation of lockdown, no markets are open for shopping but people are also staying away from purchasing clothes etc online.Former Samajwadi Party MLA Haji Parwez Ahmad and his family used to organise grand Eid celebrations every year. This year, the family has cancelled all festivities.\u201cMy family and I used to distribute new clothes among the poor on Eid and celebrate the occasion with friends and relatives. With the pandemic claiming so many lives this year, patients have been helped and all celebrations have been cancelled,\u201d the former MLA said.With deadly disease playing havoc, celebrating Eid is not only unwise but also meaningless, says MA Ansari, a senior High Court advocate, whose family has recently recovered from Covid-19.Hundreds of deaths in Old City localities of Atala, Shahganj, Akbarpur, Roshanbagh, Dariabad, Rasulpur, Rani Mandi, Daira Shah Ajmal, Kareli, Khuldabad etc have been reported in the second wave of the pandemic. Many infected are still fighting for their lives and their families are praying for their recovery.\u201cTraditionally, Eid is not celebrated in homes where a member has recently died. Prayagraj has been a symbol of mixed culture and its citizens have always shared their joys and sorrows. With so many deaths this year across the city, it is impossible for Muslims to rejoice. Religious heads have already urged to offer special Eid-ul-Fitr prayers at home,\u201d Syed Mohd Askari, a Samajwadi Party leader said.Principal of Madarsa Jammatul Abbas Maulana Kalbe Abbas Rizvi said Muslims should pray not only for themselves but also for all human beings suffering due to the pandemic.Contractor Arif Khan, a resident of Rasulpur, returned from Delhi, expecting to celebrate Eid with his large family of eight brothers. However, with the disease claiming so many lives, Arif and his kin did not purchase new clothes and other items for Eid. \u201cOur dining table used to be full with varieties of \u2018sewain\u2019 prepared by the women in our family. Our family, relatives and friends used to flock to the house throughout the day. We will miss the festivities but will pray for a happy Eid next year,\u201d Arif said."}

The cases under hospitalisation in the military increased from 1,067 on April 18 to 5,134 on May 10, reflecting, to some extent, the wider national trend of a surge in Covid-19 infections. To be sure, the armed forces have done a better job than others in checking the transmission of the virus and keeping the mortality rate exceptionally low by adhering to strict Covid protocols --- 133 deaths of serving soldiers have been reported since the pandemic broke out last year (including 17 in the three weeks cited above). The figures show that the cumulative number of soldiers discharged from military hospitals after being treated for the disease after the first outbreak in 2020 stands at 45,413 (as of May 10, 2021). Almost all soldiers in the armed forces have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus disease. Veterans suffering from Covid-19 also account for a considerable load at military hospitals. As many as 1,814 ex-servicemen are currently being treated at these hospitals, compared to 356 three weeks ago. At 1,027, the cumulative veteran deaths outnumber the serving fatalities - 44 veterans died on May 9 alone compared to a single serving soldier, a subedar. Military hospitals have discharged 5,242 veterans after treatment since last year. There are more than 3.2 million ex-servicemen in the country. Dependents of serving soldiers and ex-servicemen are also battling Covid-19 in military hospitals. As many as 3,662 dependents of serving soldiers and 1,439 dependents of veterans were undergoing treatment in military hospitals as of May 10, compared to April 18 figures of 667 and 166, respectively. The cumulative number of dependents in both categories discharged after treatment since last year stands at 11,820. Dependent deaths add up to 2,094. Dependents include spouses, sons (till the age of 25 or when they start earning, whichever is earlier), unmarried/divorced daughters, parents with a monthly income of less than 9,000 and special children for life. The number of military dependents in India is around 2.3 million. Taken together, as many as 12,049 soldiers, ex-servicemen and both their dependents are currently in military hospitals for treatment, with the cumulative death figure since last year being 2,611. In all, military hospitals admitted a total of 77,135 soldiers, veterans and their dependents over the last 14 months and discharged 63,631 patients. Civilians are also being treated at military hospitals and currently account for 448 admissions, up from 71 three weeks ago. The hospitals have recorded 177 civilian deaths since last year. While catering to the health needs of serving soldiers, veterans and their dependents, the military is also operating in full battle mode for national Covid-19 relief and foresees a bigger role for itself in the coming weeks and months to help civilian authorities tackle the pandemic.

The government needs the high court\u2019s approval before a probe by a judge, sitting or retired, can get off the ground.\u201cWe are facing a shortage of oxygen. Yesterday we required 1,200 cylinders of oxygen but we got only 400. Because of interrupted oxygen supply, I think somewhere between the hours 2am to 6am, there are a lot of deaths happening. Even today between 2am to 6am, there were around 26 deaths,\u201d Rane said.Goa recorded 75 deaths of Covid-19 patients on Tuesday, the highest single day toll since the onset of pandemic. The state also recorded 3,124 new cases, at a positivity rate of 37%, the health department said.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said the logistics of maintaining a steady supply of cylinders rather than availability of medical oxygen appeared to be the primary problem. Sawant, who interacted with doctors, health workers and patients, promised to streamline the logistical issues involved in not just getting the cylinders, but also replacing them before they run out of oxygen.The hospital, which is dealing with patients up to three times its capacity, treats many of its patients lying on stretchers or on the floor because there aren\u2019t enough beds. While patients on beds are supplied oxygen using the central piping system, the others are given oxygen supply through cylinders that need to be replaced and refilled.This is where there is a problem. If the cylinder is not replaced on time, it results in a drop in oxygen level of patients and a deterioration in their condition. On Monday night, SOS messages were sent out claiming that the oxygen cylinders were running low and there was no one to change them.Sawant said there was \u201csome mismanagement\u201d.\u201cCylinders have to be taken to the wards, the housekeeping. There needs to be a person in charge (of oxygen cylinders) for each ward. This cannot be left to nurses. Oxygen is there, but it doesn\u2019t reach the wards/patients. We will streamline the process of ensuring that the supply is adequate. We will allocate the work properly,\u201d Sawant said.\u201cWe have oxygen, but if the cylinder is not where it needs to be then it might as well be said that there is no oxygen,\u201d Sawant added. Congress leader Sunil Kawthankar said the government wasn\u2019t serious enough about the challenge at hand.\u201cSince 12.30 am, people in GMC Ward 147 were told oxygen would arrive in 10 minutes only to arrive past 4am. That too, just four cylinders. How are patients supposed to survive those several hours in between? Surprised how even after so many deaths health authorities are okay with \u2018favourite oxygen suppliers\u2019 slow mode of transportation using tractor trolleys and how still no arrangements for adequate oxygen is made. Are the lives of people so cheap? That the authorities can sleep over calmly when innocent lives are lost,\u201d Sunil Kawthankar, a Congress leader, who has also been coordinating relief efforts, said."}

Over the course of litigation brought by Epic, the game maker has claimed that Apple uses its payment system, which takes a 15% to 30% cut of transactions, and app approval process to juice profits and hurt developers.The iPhone maker provided several new statistics about its app review process and payment system to back up its defense that those measures are in place to protect consumers:Apple said its app review team \u201cis an essential line of defense\u201d and can protect users from apps that would facilitate the purchase of drugs, predatory loans, gambling and pornography. The company blocked 110,000 apps found on pirate app stores that circumvented its App Store over the last year and blocked 3.2 million apps distributed through its enterprise program in the last month.The trial in Oakland, California, comes as Apple faces a backlash -- with billions of dollars in revenue on the line -- from global regulators and some app developers who say its standard App Store fee of 30% and other policies are unjust and self-serving. Apple\u2019s disclosure of how many apps it rejects also serves its argument against Epic\u2019s request for a ruling that would unravel the app review process and pave the way for alternative payment systems.The fight with Epic blew up in August when the game maker told customers it would replace Apple\u2019s in-app purchase system with its own, circumventing Apple\u2019s commissions from add-ons inside of Fortnite. Apple then removed the game, cutting off access for more than a billion customers.Apple, which vehemently denies abusing its market power, has called Epic\u2019s legal gambit a \u201cfundamental assault\u201d on a business model that\u2019s beneficial to both developers and consumers."}

Suu Kyi's party, which won in a landslide, has rejected that.Despite the imposition of limited economic sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others, the junta has shown no sign of compromise. It has the tacit support of neighbouring China, a major investor and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.Tuesday's protests took place amid sporadic violence in the country that has included fatal attacks on military-appointed administrators and a weeks of small blasts involving homemade bombs, which the junta says is the work of the ousted government.The NUG has said the military has orchestrated much of the unrest as a pretext to intensify its crackdown.News reporting and information flow inside Myanmar has been severely impacted since the coup, with restrictions on internet access, a ban on foreign broadcasts and some news organisations ordered to close, accused by authorities of inciting rebellion.Security forces have killed 781 people since the coup, including 52 children, and 3,843 people are in detention, according to monitoring group the Association for Political Prisoners, whose figures are being used by the United Nations.The U.N. human rights body on Tuesday said the military was showing no letup in its efforts to consolidate power.In said in a statement that human rights violations went beyond the killings and included raids on homes, forced disappearances, illegal detention and the dismissal or suspension of thousands of civil servants.\"It is clear that there needs to be greater international involvement to prevent the human rights situation in Myanmar from deteriorating further,\" said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N.

It\u2019s an expansion of programs they were already providing to some low-income users in cooperation with pharmacies and non-profits.The Biden administration and its federal pharmacy partners are also seeking to start on-site vaccination clinics at community colleges in a bid to inoculate students, staff and those in nearby communities. The White House said it had selected community colleges because of the diversity of their student populations.The announcement comes as President Joe Biden is poised to meet virtually on Tuesday with the leaders of Massachusetts, Utah, Ohio, New Mexico, Maine and Minnesota to discuss \u201cinnovative ways governors are working to get the people in their states vaccinated,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber\u2019s chief executive officer, and John Zimmer, Lyft\u2019s president, urged Americans to get vaccinated in separate statements confirming the expanded programs.Biden has said the country is in a new phase of its vaccination campaign as domestic demand weakens. The U.S. is administering about 2.1 million shots per day, down from 3.4 million about a month ago, even though there\u2019s enough supply to give more.But coronavirus cases are falling at an even faster pace than vaccinations. The U.S. reported 21,767 new cases on Sunday, the lowest daily total since June 2020. In early April, the country was still averaging more than 60,000 new cases a day, according to federal data.The pool of people who will eagerly seek out an appointment to get a vaccine is all but exhausted, forcing the government to shift its attention to those willing to take it but who don\u2019t want to go out of their way.The administration\u2019s moves include winding down mass vaccination clinics while steering more shots to rural and mobile sites. Some states are offering incentives: West Virginia Governor Jim Justice has proposed giving a $100 savings bond to anyone age 16-35 who gets a shot, while leaders in New Jersey, New Orleans and Washington, D.C., have offered beers and shots of liquor.\u201cWe always expected we\u2019d be in a different phase,\u201d Psaki said Monday. \u201cAnd it means we have to work extra hard to get into communities, to have partnerships with local doctors, with primary care physicians, to expand access, expand mobile units that are going into communities to get the supply out to people.\u201dBiden and his team have repeatedly dismissed any suggestion of requiring vaccination or creating a federal registry of people who have gotten their shots, instead focusing on increasing information about vaccine safety and efficacy and access to shots.Biden\u2019s latest target calls for 70% of U.S. adults to receive at least one shot by July 4; about 58% have gotten one as of now.Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a top Biden medical adviser, said reaching the president\u2019s target likely will prevent major flare-ups later this year.\u201cThe larger proportion of the population that\u2019s vaccinated, the less likelihood that in a season like the coming fall or winter you\u2019re going to see a significant surge,\u201d Fauci said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press\u201d on Sunday."}

Mumbai City FC defender Amey Ranawade suffered a head injury that led to a concussion in the Indian Super League final against ATK Mohun Bagan in Goa on March 13.The second half of the game, and the rest of the night were a blank. They still are. The next morning brought glad tidings as the 23-year-old woke up\u2014his team had won the title. But not in his wildest dreams would he have expected a personal message from Pep Guardiola!The drama had unfolded late in the first half when Ranawade and ATK Mohun Bagan\u2019s Subhasish Bose clashed heads going for the ball near the touchline. Ranawade lay still for over five minutes, and when he tried to get up, fell again. He was taken in an ambulance to the hospital, where he was treated overnight for concussion.The morning after his team won its maiden ISL title, Ranawade woke up to a flood of messages from family, friends, team-mates, well-wishers. And the Manchester City manager.\u201c (I mean, what can I say)? I don\u2019t think I ever dreamt about something like this,\u201d Ranawade said. \u201cBeing an Indian footballer, I don\u2019t think anyone can even think of getting a message from Pep personally. To see that the morning after a night like that was magical.\u201dIt was a video message from Guardiola, delivered to him via officials of the City Football Group\u2014the parent group of Manchester City and Mumbai City\u2014who were with the Mumbai squad in the ISL bubble.\u201cAmey, I\u2019m Pep,\u201d Guardiola says in the video. \u201cFirst of all, congratulations for the league\u2014well deserved. I heard that you're having a concussion and you're in hospital. Hopefully, you can recover as soon as possible, you can get back home and celebrate this victory with your family, friends and teammates. Stay safe, stay well and I wish you all the best.\u201dGuardiola\u2019s wishes, and those from others, worked. Ranawade was discharged from hospital later that day, in time to join his team-mates in their extended celebrations at the hotel. \u201cI was happy, but looking at the faces of my team-mates it felt like they were happier,\u201d Ranawade, who was an integral part of Mumbai\u2019s dominant run in the 2020-21 season, said. \u201cThey were relieved.\u201dThose faces had been a picture of anxiety the previous night. As the stricken Ranawade was being attended to on the pitch, visuals of Mumbai left-back Vignesh Dakshinamurthy and Bagan's Manvir Singh praying flashed on TV. The entire Mumbai team was visibly shaken when the half-time whistle blew, the break helping them calm down.Two months on, most of that eventful night is a blur for Ranawade. \u201cTill date, I don\u2019t remember any of that; the doctors told me I never will because of the concussion. I was told I wanted to carry on playing. It was only the next morning that my friends, family and doctors told me what had happened,\u201d he said.Mumbai City won the final to add to their Shield triumph. Every victory speech, by the players and head coach Sergio Lobera, was about how they wanted to win it for Ranawade. Moroccan midfielder Ahmed Jahouh held the youngster\u2019s No. 4 jersey when the team lifted the trophy. \u201cWhen I woke up the next day, I saw those pictures and heard from my family what my team-mates had done, how everyone spoke about me. I was in tears. Such big players, such a big team and doing these things for me. To win the trophy with them, even if I wasn\u2019t part of the celebrations, was a great feeling.\u201dRanawade enjoyed a fruitful ISL, and for the first time playing for his home club. The right-back featured in 20 matches in the season, notching up 30 clearances, 67 tackles and 34 interceptions. He played a key role alongside the likes of Mourtada Fall to keep Mumbai's defensive structure while providing a thrust to Lobera\u2019s attacking game. More than the numbers, Ranawade cherished his game time\u20141,564 minutes this term compared to 66 in the previous edition playing two matches for FC Goa.\u201cThe last two seasons I didn\u2019t get much game time. I gained a lot of experience this season. I learnt a lot playing with guys like Fall, Hernan (Santana), Jahouh. I was with them before but playing competitive matches in a league is totally different to training with them.\u201dTurning up for his home club while continuing to evolve as a player under Lobera\u2014he coached FC Goa last season before shifting\u2014was a bonus. \u201cI knew even before joining Mumbai City what kind of football he likes and what I was expected to do. I love his style of play. I support Manchester City, enjoy Pep Guardiola\u2019s football. I love it.\u201dRanawade\u2019s bond with football, and its most famous coach, has only strengthened."}

It may have a cascading effect,\u201d the order said. During the proceedings, the Karnataka government informed the Court that it is stopping the first dose, to provide second doses to those above the age of 45 years. However, the court quoting numbers questioned the availability of the vaccines. \u201cOnly 9 lakh doses available. 16 lakh people need a second dose immediately. Forget about the 18-44 age group. They can\u2019t even give a second dose. For people above 45 years, how will state give the second dose,\u201d the bench pointed out. The bench further added that the second dose of Covaxin should be taken within four weeks while asking about the implications of the delay in giving the second dose. \u201cAs per the target of 1.71 crores, 72 lakh have been given first dose and over 11 lakh given the second dose. Hence, it is obvious that if the present scenario continues, the first dose cannot be given to front-line workers and 18-44 years\u2026 If the present scenario continues, the entire vaccination drive will be completely ineffective,\u201d the bench said.Talking about the availability of oxygen, the court also pointed out that despite the Centre telling the court that the state\u2019s oxygen quota is being increased from 965 MT to 1200 MT, no document has been placed on record to prove this said allocation. \u201cThe Court, therefore, proceeded to direct the state government to place on record its daily requirement of oxygen from May 5 till May 11 and quantum of oxygen actually procured. The state government should also place on record projected requirement of state for at least for 1 week from tomorrow (Wednesday),\u201d the HC direct. The court also observed the incidents of the police excesses that were reported on the first day of the second lockdown. \u201cPolice excesses should be avoided, and people must co-operate with the government. If people are not cooperating, take them to the nearest police station,\u201d said the bench. "}

The last time Chinese state media acknowledged local cases was in early April.The expert noted that strict border controls meant few Chinese have naturally acquired immunity against the new viral mutants while at the same time the efficacy of China's vaccines against the new strains remains largely uncertain.Currently, China only grants admission to foreigners with work visas and stay permits who must get clean slates in blood serum and polymerase chain reaction tests 24 hours before their departure. Upon arrival in China, they must undergo up to three weeks of quarantine as well as multiple subsequent tests before they are granted admission, reported Asia Times.Also, China's slow vaccine take-up also means the masses are ill-prepared for any influx of the virus from border re-openings. The NHC's previous vaccination target of 40 per cent of the entire population, or 560 million Chinese, by the end of June now looks unachievable as daily jabs administered nationwide continue to hover around five million, half of the original goal.The NHC said on Monday that more than 324 million doses had been given, though it didn't say how many have received the two shots needed to be fully vaccinated. Experts now warn that the slow pace of vaccination combined with people's hesitancy has left Beijing with no choice but to fortify the border firewall, reported Asia Times."}

These are perhaps the first cases of black fungus among corona patients in the state. Black fungus or mucormycosis is caused by exposure to mucor mould which is ubiquitous. It affects the sinuses, the brain and the lungs and can be life-threatening.Assistant chief medical officer ( ACMO) Dr Pooja Sharma confirmed to the media on Tuesday that the rare fungal infection had been detected in two Covid -19 patients undergoing treatment in a private hospital here. She said one patient was from Muzaffarnagar and another from Bijnor. Chief medical officer ( CMO) Dr Akhilesh Mohan said that he had sought a report from the hospital in this regard. Two other patients with black fungus infection reported at an eye hospital and were cured. Dr Shakeel Ahmad, chairman and chief medical director of Vision Care Superspeciality Eye Hospital, said that it was a rare and potentially fatal fungal infection called mucormycosis. Dr Shakeel said that last week he also came across two patients in his OPD who developed black fungus infection after recovering from Covid-19. One of the women patients, above 60 years of age, was from neighbouring Hapur district. \u201cI am unable to recall the native place of the other patient right now,\u201d said Dr Shakeel. In one patient the infection was at an advanced stage and cured through surgery while in the other it was in a preliminary stage and cured with medicines. Dr Shakeel explained that use of high flow of oxygen during treatment of Covid-19 patients infused moisture inside, which caused serious problems starting with nasal congestion. In many cases it badly affected the eyes and could be detected and cured by keeping a close examination of eyes and nasal obstruction during treatment. "}

As per the Allahabad high court order of February 4, 2021, the state government and the state election commission are supposed to hold indirect elections to the posts of zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat chairpersons, completing the exercise by May 25 after holding direct elections by May 10. The four-phase direct elections in which around 12 crore rural voters exercised their franchise to elect village pradhans, village ward members, kshetra panchayat and zila panchayat ward members are over with counting of votes last week. Now, 75,852 kshetra panchayat members and 3,050 zila pachayat members elected in the recent direct polls will vote to elect 75 zila panchayat and 826 kshetra panchayat chiefs respectively in the final round. The state government, according to people dealing with the issue, has decided to not hold indirect elections till the pandemic subsides in the state and it may soon seek the court\u2019s permission for the same. \u201cHaving drawn a lot of flak for not deferring the three-tier panchayat polls despite the devastating second wave of the Covid-19, the government has got cold feet about its plans to hold indirect rural polls this month\u201d, they disclosed. Indicating that the indirect rural polls may be put on hold for now, minister panchayati raj, Bhupendra Singh Chaudhary said that the government\u2019s entire focus, as of now, was on winning the fight against the pandemic. \u201cThe current time is not conducive to holding polls and the government wants to focus on its fight against the Covid-19 that has started spreading its tentacles in rural areas as well,\u201d he said before adding, \u201cBut no final decision on polls has been taken yet.\u201d Additional chief secretary panchayati raj, Manoj Kumar Singh also said the issue was under consideration. \u201cA final call on this issue will be taken soon,\u201d he said. Another senior official, however, disclosed that the government would soon file an affidavit in the high court, stating that due to the pandemic it was not advisable to hold indirect rural polls at this juncture. \u201cThe hearing of the case filed in January is already scheduled to be held on May 27 by the court and the government is most likely to submit an affidavit the court the same day, explaining why it could not comply with its earlier directives for holding indirect elections by May 25,\u201d sources revealed.

This could be even more severe in the anticipated third wave as vaccination for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers is under consideration by the government of India. According to the British Medical Journal there are 44 reported cases of neonates with confirmed Covid-19. The study states: \u201c26 observational studies (18 case reports and ei0ght case series) with 44 newborns with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. Studies were mainly from China and Italy. Half of neonates had a documented contact with the infected mother and one out of three infected neonates was admitted from home. Median age at diagnosis was five days. One out of four neonates was asymptomatic, and the remaining showed mild symptoms typical of acute respiratory infections and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. The majority of neonates were left in spontaneous breathing (room air) and had good prognosis after a median duration of hospitalisation of 10 days\u201d. Dr Pradeep Suryanvashi, who is working as a consultant with the three hospitals, Noble hospital, Sahyadri hospital and Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital said, \u201cWe have seen 11 newborn babies with Covid-19 infection after five days of life. Most of the babies had fever as a presentation, four babies presented with breathing problems and one baby presented with convulsion (viral encephalitis). This type of presentation we have not noticed in the first wave. We also saw rare cases of one case of convulsion and heart failure. In view of the anticipated third wave we have prepared six beds in intensive care for neonatal Ccovid-19 cases.\u201dDr Suryavanshi also added it was found that steroids worked well with the babies. He said, \u201cSome of the common symptoms among symptomatic newborns were fever, decreased feeding, dehydration, loose motions, breathing difficulty, convulsion, cardiac failure and renal failure.\u201d \u201cRegarding treatment for severe neonate cases, it was found that the baby needs admission in neonatal ICU. No need of Remdesivir for newborn infection and it was found that there is no role of immunoglobulin and plasma therapy,\u201d he added. In view of the increasing cases of Covid19 among paediatric and neonates, the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) released a statement that said, \u201cPregnant women are not at increased risk of getting infected as compared to the general population. Just as for the general population, Covid-19 has an asymptomatic or mild course for most pregnant women. However, compared to non-pregnant women and pregnant women who are not infected, pregnant women who are infected are more likely to need hospitalisation, and critical care.\u201d The statement added, \u201cFor pregnant women, live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated. It should be noted that none of the vaccines available in the market globally are live attenuated. Other vaccines which may have some theoretical considerations regarding transmission are the viral vector vaccines. We emphasise that these considerations are theoretical. One can conclude that based on the mechanism of the available vaccines; there is no obvious basis for excluding pregnant or lactating women from vaccination.\u201d"}

While these two committees have a clear task cut out for them, party leaders were quick to point out the significance of the presence of Azad and Tewari in these all-important panels. A senior leader added that this is the first time after Azad retired from the Rajya Sabha as the Leader of Opposition, the party has formally appointed him for an assignment, that too, a crucial job given the surge of the Covid-19 pandemic in India.

Tewari, who had campaigned for the party in the recently-concluded assembly polls, has also found a position for another key work.

The Government Resolution (GR) cited a Bombay High Court decision from August 4, 2017, that invalidated reservation in promotion of government officials to make the decision.

When Pune witnessed a 69.7% case positivity rate in the first week of March 2021, it started measures like night curfew, imposed from 11 pm. to 6 am. This resulted in two things, reduction in growth trajectory of Covid cases and reduction in positivity rate, as positivity rate reduced from 41.8% to 23.4 %.

Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) social-media cell co-coordinators Vineet Vajpayee, Rupesh Pawar and Gaurav Shetty lodged the FIR under section 469 (forgery for the purpose of harming the reputation of any person or knowing that it is likely to be used for that purpose) and section 501 (printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

It's possibly going to be a more prolonged long-drawn-out process running possibly till July, That means, even if the curve starts to decline, we will continue to have to deal with a large number of infections every day,\u201d Jameel said.\u00a0According to the scientist, Covid-19 cases in the second wave also won\u2019t come down in as steady a fashion as they did after the first wave.\u00a0\u201cIn the first wave, we did see a steady decline. But remember\u2026 this time we are starting from a higher number. Instead of 96,000-97,000 cases, we are starting from over 400,000. So it will take that much longer. And during the process at every time point, you'll have a lot of cases,\u201d Jameel explained.In his view, the actual mortality data for India is completely wrong. \u201c\u2026 not because of some evil design of someone or a group of people or the state or whatever. But the way we record data I think is faulty.\u201d\u00a0Discussing why India faced a second wave, he said the constant narrative was that somehow Indians are special and have some special kind of immunity.\u00a0\u201cYou know, we had BCG shots when we are children. We get a lot of malaria. So you get all sorts of arguments,\u201d he said. The BCG\u00a0vaccine is primarily used against tuberculosis.The noted virologist also said people gave opportunity to the virus not to just spread but also to transmit quickly by not adhering to Covid-19 protocols.\u201c..by the time we came to December and the cases kept going down, we did start believing in this narrative (of immunity). There were a lot of big weddings that we had in January and February. So super spreading events happened,\u201d he added.\u00a0\u00a0He cited other \"super spreading events\", including elections rallies and religious congregations, for the high number of cases in the second wave.\u00a0Vaccine coverage is a matter of concern in his view.Enough people, he said, did not get vaccinated when they had the opportunity in January and February.\u00a0\u00a0\u201c\u2026 around the third week of February when numbers started going up, we had very, very little vaccine coverage, possibly about 2 per cent of people,\u201d Jameel said, adding that some people believed in the messaging that vaccines were not safe.\u201cVaccines are safe and the side effects are very rare. There are more chances of someone dying from lightning than due to rare side effects of vaccines.\u201d\u00a0Referring to the vaccine shortage in some states, he noted that all big countries that had vaccinated a considerable proportion of their population had booked their doses around June 2020.\u00a0\u201cIndia didn't do that. We did have a big vaccine enterprise but remember our biggest vaccine companies are private limited companies. You know, it's another story that going back a few years we closed down all our public vaccine enterprises. So we depend entirely on the private sector.\u00a0\u201cPrivate sector does not work on charity. The private sector needs to be given orders for them to be confident or, you know, building facilities to make vaccines. And that is where we took our eye off the ball,\u201d he said.\u00a0However, the virologist said funds have now been allotted to Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech and the Serum Institute of India, Pune, and both are expanding facilities. But it will take around July by the time vaccine supplies normalise.\u00a0Calculations done during the first wave suggested that herd immunity may set in when about 65 per cent of the population gets infected or vaccinated. It no longer holds true, Jameel said.\u00a0Herd immunity is a form of indirect protection that can occur when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through vaccination or previous infections. However, for Covid-19, it is not known when such immunity will set in.\u00a0\u201cNow you have a virus that is moving at least twice as fast as thought, if not more. So what you need is you know, at least possibly 75 per cent of the population to be infected or vaccinated before we can achieve what you call herd immunity. So it's a shifting goal post right now.\u00a0\u201c\u00a0\u201cAnd that is why it is so important for us to go and get vaccinated as soon as vaccines are available,\u201d he added.\u00a0The virologist also said India may possibly see many waves of Covid-19 pandemic depending upon the conditions at that time and the progress of the vaccination drive.

L Brands, based in Columbus, Ohio, has been shopping the struggling chain elsewhere since the collapse of that deal and said it had held talks with a number of potential buyers, but it appears it could not come to an agreement on price.Victoria's Secret was to be sold to Sycamore Partners last year for about $525 million, but the private equity firm sued to get out of the deal citing the coronavirus pandemic. At that point, Victoria's Secret was forced to close stores and sales, which had been falling as the brand fell out of favor, evaporated.Victoria's Secret has been trying to turn its business around, with an eye on changing the corporate culture, reinventing fashions and redesigning stores. While the brand had been known for its sexy style, women have increasingly shifted toward more comfortable options, particularly during the pandemic when many have spent most of their time at home.But Victoria\u2019s Secret had a long unparalleled run of success. The brand was founded by the late Roy Larson Raymond in the late 1970s after he felt embarrassed about purchasing lingerie for his wife. Les Wexner, founder of the then Limited Stores Inc., purchased Victoria\u2019s Secret in 1982 and turned it into a powerful retail force. By the mid-1990s, Victoria\u2019s Secret lit up runways and later filled the internet with its supermodels and an annual television special that mixed fashion, beauty and music.Failing to adapt to changing tastes saw sales tumble, and its annual show was canceled in 2019. There's also been increased competition. Rivals like Adore Me and ThirdLove, which have sprouted up online and marketed themselves heavily on social media platforms like Instagram, have focused on fit and comfort while offering more options for different body types. Meanwhile, American Eagle\u2019s Aerie lingerie chain, which partners with women activists like Manuela Baron, has also lured customers away from Victoria\u2019s Secret.With the decision announced Tuesday, L Brands created two independent, publicly traded companies, the other being Bath & Body Works.Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said that the spinoff means Victoria's Secret will have to stand on its own.\u201cIts numbers will no longer be flattered by the contribution of Bath & Body Works, and its management team will be fully accountable to investors,\" he said.The split becomes official in August if approved by the board at L Brands. Shares of the company fell 2.8% in early trading on Tuesday."}

Once a rare infection, Mucormycosis, commonly called the \u201cblack fungus\u201d has now become an increasingly common complaint among patients who have recovered from Covid-19. In severe cases, the infection could lead to loss of eyesight and in rare cases, death. Hospitals are also finding it difficult to admit such patients due to the non-availability of beds for non-Covid patients. Sahyadri hospital is now seeing 40-50 black fungus cases a month across its four branches. Dr Kailash Sant, ENT specialist at Sahyadri hospital said, \u201cWe are seeing an increasing number of cases from all over and the interiors of Maharashtra coming to Pune for treatment. Those who have recovered from Covid-19 should be vigilant as post-Covid Mucormycosis has become a cause of concern in the second wave. The mortality rate is almost 50% where the brain is involved and about 20% in nasal and orbital involvement. Judicious use of steroids in treatment of Covid-19 and strict control over blood glucose levels can bring down the risk of Mucormycosis.\u201d Doctors at Noble, where a patient underwent reconstructive surgery after losing his eye two weeks ago, said hospital has seen about 40 cases in the last one month alone. Dr Abhishek Ghosh, a microvascular reconstructive surgeon from Noble hospital who treated the patient, said, \u201cFrom mid-March to mid-April, we saw six to seven cases. Recently, in the last 30 days we have seen 30 to 40 cases of Mucormycosis. Around 80 per cent of people do well post treatment. Because of increased awareness, we are able to save a patient\u2019s eyesight, as they are coming at early stages. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical in saving vision and life in such patients.\u201d Dr H K Sale, executive director of Noble hospital said, \u201cWe are not able to admit more non-Covid19 patients due to unavailability of beds, but we are seeing a rising number of such patients.\u201d Ruby hall has about 15 such patients currently undergoing treatment. Also Rising Medicare hospital, Symbiosis Lavale hospital, Rao Nursing home and Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital are all treating black fungus cases. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director, Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital said, \u201cCurrently there are three cases of Mucormycosis under treatment and we have seen 10 cases which came in in just the last two months. We also saw two deaths due to the infection.\u201d District administration does not have a count on how many such cases have been reported in the city. District health officer Dr Bhagwan Pawar said, \u201cWe do not have any such number on how many reported cases of Mucormycosis. However, the district task force has sent out an advisory to government hospitals to take all necessary precautions and seek administrative help when required.\u201d The Indian Medical Association (IMA), Maharashtra chapter welcomed the government decision to offer free treatment for Mucormycosis. \u201cIt is known that this fungal infection of Mucormycosis is common in diabetics and in cases of Covid-19 treated by injudicious use of steroids. We, at IMA are making our members aware of the above facts and training them in proper treatment. We are sure that the government will show a similar proactive approach,\u201d stated IMA in a press release issues on Tuesday. In view of the costly treatment, the state government has decided to include expenses under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. \u201cThe treatment for Mucormycosis is costly. So the government has decided that Mucormycosis patients will be treated for free under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana,\u201d said Maharashtra health Minister Rajesh Tope speaking to reporters in Mumbai. According to the health minister, 2,000 cases have been reported and eight people have died of this infection in the state so far. \u201cWe are making special wards for these patients. An awareness campaign to educate people about the infection will also be organised while government is planning to procure drugs to treat the infection,\u201d Tope said. \u201cThe incidence of Mucormycosis among corona patients with uncontrolled diabetes is on the rise and the state government has decided to procure 0.1 million injectable vials effective against the disease. A request has been made to Haffkine Institute for the same and the procurement process will be carried out by issuing a tender,\u201d he said. Infection mainly affects people who have health problems or take medicines that lower the body\u2019s ability to fight germs and sickness, commonly known as low-immunity status or immune compromised individuals. Early signs include headache, facial numbness, nasal stuffiness, reduced vision, vision loss, inability to open the eye and redness in the eye. If you notice any symptoms, immediately visit doctor for diagnostic nasal endoscopy examination. Mucormycosis is seen in the deep areas of the nose and sinuses (as blackish discoloured mucosa), which may not be visualised by conventional methods of nose examination. Early diagnosis with MRI &CT scan of nose, sinuses, jaw bones, orbit and brain will formulate treatment protocol. This will include early administration of antifungal drugs, tight control of blood sugar level , plus timely intervention by endoscopic radical debridement surgery to reduce fungal load from sinuses. Treatment consists of tight control of blood sugar levels (daily basis) and maintaining normal function of kidneys and other organs.However in instances where the disease is detected late and involves eye/ jaw bones, extensive surgery may be the only choice and can result in disfigurement of face.In some cases the treatment may involve a multidisciplinary approach and involve a physician, diabetologist, infectious disease expert, microbiologist, ENT endoscopy surgeon, eye surgeon, oral surgeon, neuro physician, nephrologist and neurosurgeon.

A division bench of Justices K K Tated and N R Borkar on May 6 heard an application filed by Karnataka\u2019s Biovet Private Limited, seeking direction to the Maharashtra government to hand over possession of the manufacturing unit at Manjari Khurd village in Pune. Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forest (Pune division), said his department, which owns the land, will cooperate with the procedure while formalities related to the hand-over will be completed in two-three days, following which the pharma company can make arrangements for vaccine production. The unit was first being used by Intervet India Pvt Ltd, a multinational and subsidiary of Merck & Co, after land was granted to it in 1973 to manufacture vaccines for the foot and mouth disease. Later Intervet decided to exit business operations in India and entered into an agreement with Biovet for the transfer of the land and manufacturing unit. However when Biovet sought the Maharashtra government\u2019s approval for the transfer, the forest department claimed the land was reserved and the initial 1973 grant itself was a violation. Biovet later approached the Bombay High Court challenging the forest department\u2019s order.\u201cThe land belongs to the forest department. Now according to the HC order it will be given to them temporarily to manufacture Covid vaccines,\u201d said Patil.Patil clarified that the use of this manufacturing unit is approved on a temporary basis to produce life-saving vaccines during the pandemic. \u201cThat land was assigned to the company before. Infrastructure is ready on that land. As per the court order we will handover it to the concerned party,\u201d said Patil. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the process to activate the vaccine plant in Pune will be expedited. \u201cWe want to vaccinate everyone in the state to defeat the virus. I have directed the Pune Collector to make the land available for Bharat Biotech\u2019s vaccine plant,\u201d said Ajit Pawar in Mumbai at an online event. The vaccine manufacturing facility is situated in a village in Manjari Khurd in Haveli taluka, on land measuring 11.58 hectares.

Another man kept nudging him for a better view. Exasperated, the big man picked him up and dropped him into the lion enclosure. There, he said, you now have the closest view. The policy to increase demand for vaccines by opening vaccination up to adults below 45 years, allowing states to compete, and firms to price, in a situation of vaccine supply shortage, seems born out of such pique.States are irresponsible in demanding vaccination for all, when the total supply is not even three million doses a day. The Centre is reckless in agreeing to the demand and callous in designing a new \u201cliberalised\u201d scheme to replace a more reasonable previous policy.Any vaccine policy must increase supply as quickly as possible; procure at the least expensive cost, while enabling medium-term planning; and distribute to most effectively save lives now and in the future. The current version does none of these.First, we are buying vaccines like monthly groceries. The finance minister said that Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech will get an advance of 3,000 crore and 1,567 crore respectively. Instead, they are being paid about half that to supply 160 million doses at 157 a jab, a month\u2019s supply if the target is five million a day, and for less than two months even at April\u2019s lower usage. The implicit rationale is that the Centre will only help vaccinate the 45-plus population, with the rest of the supply presumably met from other firms.Vaccinating the rest is the task of the states.Will manufacturers invest in increasing supply, without clear future orders? Sputnik V has been approved and a few million initial doses will be imported, but, apparently, though six manufacturers reportedly stand ready to deliver, orders are awaited. Janssen and Novavax are not yet approved. Both have identified Indian manufacturing partners and one hopes they will not be deterred by the current need to negotiate with multiple states, rather than one national government. Covaxin supply too can be increased by outsourcing to other firms, especially since intellectual property rights are shared with the Indian Council of Medical Research.We must stop shadowboxing. In no other federal country are sub-national governments competing to buy vaccines. The Centre should negotiate a single price for each vaccine, with a delivery schedule, contingent on regulatory approval. Large national orders will provide the reassurance needed for investment to the various manufacturers and reliability of supply for our vaccination demand of one-and-a-half billion doses. This will allow firms to plan to meet our other international commitments, especially to COVAX, where our default in supply has left most developing nations hanging on to nothing, precipitating a Chinese turn.Second, on pricing. The new policy appears designed to punish the states. In the relatively sensible \u201cpre-liberalisation\u201d policy, the vaccine cost was borne by the Centre, for which it has budgeted 35,000 crore, and the vaccination cost was largely borne by the state, with an important private supplement. Daily press releases of \u201cfree vaccines\u201d to states, like a kind of dole, are offensive to this spirit of federal cost-sharing.Under the new policy, the Centre procures only half the supply. A quarter is for states, shared as per central quota, and a quarter for the private sector, which is paying twice, or thrice (in Covaxin\u2019s case) the price. If SII and Bharat Biotech behave like normal private firms, they will first meet the entire demand of the private sector at the higher price and then offer the remaining supply, if any, to the states. For the right to vaccinate younger people, states will now get less vaccine and pay more for it.This is chillingly stated in the health minister\u2019s blog. The \u201cprivate\u2026 route will empower a large number of people to get themselves quickly vaccinated\u2026 those who can afford to get them at the private\u2026 rates shall go ahead.\u201d Shared idealism indeed. Michael Sandel\u2019s market society writ large. Or is it Deng Xiaoping \u2014 some people get rich first? All this so the states can vaccinate the 18-44 age group, which accounted for 12% of the vaccinations in the first week of May. Why is this tail wagging the dog?Third, if the Centre negotiates price and quantities with vaccine-makers, supply can be transparently allocated using current metrics, ie a state\u2019s population of 45-plus; possibly adding urbanisation, since the virus favours dense urban areas, though the second surge is not sparing villages; and current caseload \u2014 leveraging the first dose\u2019s protection to save as many lives as possible. There can be a little extra incentive supply for states that vaccinate more, while a small share can be flexible for state-specific demands. Similar flexibility already exists in the National Health Mission. If states can agree on tax-sharing, they can agree on vaccine-sharing too. A predictable supply will allow states to plan better and take vaccines closer and faster to the people \u2013 rather than passively wait for them. Some version of such a substantially and radically modified policy \u2014 a more transparent and flexible version of what was being pursued \u201cpre-liberalisation\u201d \u2014 can even lead to a fully vaccinated population by year-end, and even exports if manufacturers invest in starting production early.So, will the Centre and states continue to keep posturing or will they sit down to make a sensible policy? In the past, such bickering usually affected only livelihoods. This time, it affects lives \u2013 of Indians, and of people around the world.Partha Mukhopadhyay is a senior fellow, Centre for Policy ResearchThe views expressed are personal"}

With the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led Nepali Congress (NC), Prachanda-led Maoist Centre, a faction of Mr Oli\u2019s party led by Madhav Nepal, and the Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) \u2014 a largely Madhesi formation \u2014 either opposing the PM or abstaining from Monday\u2019s vote, Mr Oli is now a caretaker PM. But this does not mean that the political turmoil in Nepal is over; in fact, it may just mark the beginning of another round of volatility. To form an alternative government, the NC, Maoists, Mr Nepal\u2019s faction, and the JSP now have to come together \u2014 but the JSP is torn. One faction led by veteran Madhesi leader Mahant Thakur is keen to maintain a policy of equidistance from both Mr Oli and Mr Deuba (who would be PM if the NC formed the next government), claiming that neither serve Madhesi interests. This is widely attributed to India\u2019s advice to Mr Thakur to stay neutral, since Mr Oli still has New Delhi\u2019s support. Another faction, led by another Madhesi leader Upendra Yadav and former PM Baburam Bhattarai, is keen to oust Mr Oli from power \u2014 on the grounds that democracy is at stake. If a new government isn\u2019t formed, Nepal\u2019s president will eventually invite Mr Oli again \u2014 as the leader of the single largest party \u2014 to continue as PM.All of this is happening when Nepal is going through a devastating wave of Covid-19, with its health care infrastructure under tremendous strain. Mr Oli wrote a piece in desperately seeking international assistance. Nepal\u2019s vaccination plans have also slowed down because of India\u2019s own internal vaccine shortage, resulting in restrictions on outside supplies. For Nepal to focus on the emergency at hand, the first step is having a legitimate and fully functional government immediately. India\u2019s support, the resultant division in the JSP, and the indifference of Mr Deuba himself (he isn\u2019t fully sure if assuming leadership at this time is politically beneficial) may still help Mr Oli stay in power. But he has been irresponsible when it comes to Covid management, undemocratic when it comes to internal politics, and discriminatory when it comes to minorities. Delhi should step back, let the political process play out organically, be open to democratic alternatives (irrespective of who leads it), support the new government, and help its closest neighbour, to whatever extent is possible, without compromising domestic needs, in dealing with the pandemic."}

This fast-track clearance can harm the environment as well as lives and livelihoods.

Importantly, the local communities had a chance to voice their opinions. An example is the Andaman water aerodrome project. The green assessment of this new project has established that the site for the construction of the terminal building and associate infrastructure will impact mangroves, which are natural green barriers, and that the local administration has no mitigation plan. A ministry panel has now raised questions, based on this EIA.Economic growth is a key national imperative. But it will not be possible to sustain high growth by using short-cuts.

But after failing to make it into the playing XI in the Test series against Australia, and then not being able to impress in the home Test series against England, questions were raised on his recent form.Now, as India prepare to travel to England for the upcoming World Test Championship final against New Zealand and the following five-match Test series against England, Kuldeep has found himself out of the traveling squad.Speaking in a recent interaction with Sports Today, former India cricketer Deep Dasgupta explained why he was surprised to see Kuldeep not being included in the squad.\"With Kuldeep, I am a little surprised (not picked for England tour). Because a year ago, he was the No. 1 spinner. Within a year, he is not on the contract list. He is not there on any side,\" he said.\"He might be there in the side for Sri Lanka. But I am a little surprised. Obviously, his arc has gone down, his performances have gone down. I still believe that his skill set is very unique. And we need to keep investing in him,\" he further added.\"I understand why he is not on the side, because of his performance. I still believe he is young. He has a lot of cricket left in him and he should not be left in the lurch, let to be on his own. We must back him,\" he further said.\"I hope so (he gets picked for the Sri Lanka tour). On the white-ball side, obviously someone like Yuzvendra Chahal, Rahul Chahar and Kuldeep... they should all be there,\" Dasgupta signed off."}

In a video that has gone viral on social media, the woman is seen wailing and appealing to people not to trust hospitals. Narrating her ordeal, the woman is heard saying she was molested by an employee at the Glocal Hospital in Bhagalpur, who she identified as one Jyoti Kumar. The woman\u2019s husband, a software engineer, was later brought to a private hospital in Patna where he died on May 8. The woman has alleged that a doctor at the Patna hospital too molested her and the hospital administration deliberately switched off the oxygen supply in the ICU to force people to buy oxygen cylinders. Talking to media persons in Patna, the woman said her family, living in Noida, had come to Bhagalpur to celebrate Holi and decided to stay back as Covid cases began rising across the country. On April 9, her husband fell ill and got himself tested twice for coronavirus, but the results were negative. Later, a doctor in Noida asked him to get a chest CT scan done, which showed infection in the lungs. The man and her mother were admitted to Glocal Hospital in Bhagalpur. The woman said Jyoti Kumar, an attendant at the hospital, molested her several times. She said that in the meantime, her husband\u2019s condition worsened, after which he was referred for treatment to Mayaganj government hospital, but doctors there refused to attend to him. \u201cWe then decided to take him to a hospital in Patna and admitted him in the ICU on April 26. However, doctors there did not even visit the ICU. One of them inappropriately touched me several times during his visit to the ICU. I could not gather courage to shout as I feared for my husband,\u201d she said. She alleged the hospital staff cut off her husband\u2019s oxygen supply and she was forced to buy oxygen cylinders from the black market. The hospital sold an oxygen cylinder for 50,000 each, she alleged. When contacted, Glocal Hospital at Bhagalpur accepted that a person by the name of Jyoti Kumar worked in the hospital. \u201cWe have removed Jyoti Kumar from the services and the police are free to probe and take action,\u201d said Dr Ajim, the hospital\u2019s managing director. Meanwhile, Bhagalpur\u2019s senior superintendent of police Natasha Gudia said a three-member team headed by city SP Puran Jha would probe the incident. The SSP said she spoke to the woman and asked her to send a written complaint about the incident. Meanwhile, Patna High Court advocate Sama Sinha mentioned the incident before the court and urged it to take suo motu cognizance. Sinha said she had sought an urgent hearing in the case.

The Mahavir Vatsalya Hospital, which reached out to the Serum Institute of India (SII) to procure Covishield vaccines, was on Monday told to wait for another three to four months for the vaccines, said Dr Upendra Prasad Sinha, nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination. \u201cThe firm\u2019s Mumbai office has told us to access the vaccines when it becomes available in the private market supply chain channels, which will take about 3-4 months from now,\u201d added Dr Sinha. \u201cThe medical representative of the Serum Institute has communicated the head of paediatrics department Dr Vijay Ranjan that our hospital is among the four private centres shortlisted by the firm for giving vaccines in Patna because of our bulk consumption of children vaccines for other diseases,\u201d said Acharya Kishore Kunal, secretary of the Mahavir Mandir Temple Trust, which runs a series of hospitals in Bihar. The hospital used to vaccinate around 100-150 people till April 30. The government move has also dissuaded the Ruban Memorial Hospital in New Patliputra Colony. \u201cI am not keen to continue with the vaccination now that the government is not providing us the vaccines. Taking it as a social commitment, we provided our infrastructure and manpower to help the government in its vaccination drive. If the government expects us to buy the vaccines on our own and administer it to people, I don\u2019t think we are interested in it because our hands are full in management of Covid-19 cases,\u201d said Dr Satyajit Singh, managing director of the Ruban hospital, accredited to the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH). The Ruban used to vaccinate an average 250-400 people per day, he claimed. The Paras-HMRI Hospital, another private facility accredited to the NABH said it was clueless where to get the vaccines from. \u201cWe are cluless at this point where to get the vaccines from. The state health department is also not clear about it. Our Gurgaon office wrote to the Serum Institute of India for the vaccine, but it has not responded yet. If the government provides us the Covid-19 vaccines, we are ready to administer them to people,\u201d said Dr Syed Asif Rahman, medical superintendent, Paras-HMRI Hospital, Patna. The hospital, he said, used to administer an average 150-200 vaccine doses per day till April 30. Meanwhile, the NTPC, a public sector undertaking, wrote to the Patna district magistrate (DM) Chandrashekhar Singh on Tuesday requesting him to establish Covid-19 vaccination centre at NTPC Barh to facilitate its employees take the jab. \u201cWe have around 320 employees below 45 years of age at NTPC Barh who may please be vaccinated at utmost priority,\u201d said Onkar Nath, deputy general manager (HR), in his letter to the Patna DM. Earlier, on May 5, regional executive director East-1, Praveen Saxena wrote to the Bihar chief secretary, urging him to establish Covid-19 vaccination centre at various NTPC plants of Bihar to facilitate NTPC employees and its associates take the shot. COVID WATCH Bihar reported 10,920 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the state\u2019s cumulative tally to 6,12,570 It reported 72 deaths, taking the total death toll to 3,429.

Changing the route might be the need of the hour, but according to the actor, it doesn\u2019t mean OTT is a threat to the big screen. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the cinema watching experience in a large darkened hall with other people, and all the reactions, which is infectious, can ever be replaced,\u201d the actor says with confidence, and continues, \u201cBut OTT platforms have recently defined its audience.\u201dHooda points out that this change in consumption pattern has not only made the web a lucrative avenue for filmmakers, but is also giving new lease of life to some old projects. Picking examples from his work life, the 44-year-old reveals, \u201cA lot of my films which suffered because of marketing or release (plan), have now found their audience on digital platforms\u201d.The actor, who has actively explored the OTT space in India as well as internationally, credits the pandemic for boosting the popularity of the medium. \u201cThe growth which was to come in industry in the next five years \u2014 in terms of the content we produce or the movies we make \u2014 has hastened up because of Covid-19. For all these months when people were in lockdown, they explored a variety of different themes and different executions,\u201d he opines. And no wonder, the audience today is yearning for something new and different, \u201cbecause maturity in the audience has come earlier than it would have otherwise\u201d.Fortunately, Hooda isn\u2019t the person who fears change, instead he welcomes it. \u201cI try to adapt to the changing world as best as I can. Like, I adapted due to the Covid-19 pandemic, lockdown and adapted to the fact that you don\u2019t need much, that happiness is dependent on very less compared to what we think,\u201d says Hooda, who made his international web debut last year with Chris Hemsworth-starrer Extraction, and will soon be seen in web series, Inspector Avinash. At the moment, he feels more adaptable than before. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing, and no roles I want to avoid. I\u2019m playing a full-fledged villain in Radhe for the first time. That has been a welcome change. I\u2019m hoping that there\u2019ll will be more things that knock on my door, which I\u2019ve not thought of. I hope I can do them and cope with it,\u201d he concludes."}

They have developed a digital portal for oxygen monitoring which they feel would help in ensuring timely supply of oxygen. National level shooter Raj Kumar, who runs an organization named Rodic Consutants, came up with the idea and sought support in the initiative to fight Covid. Well-known shooters like Asutosh Dwiwedi (UP), Pardeep Kumar Singh (Haryana), Tabish Ahmed (UP), Rahul Soni (Delhi), Monu Kumar (Delhi), Harpreet Singh (Delhi) and Shalender (UP) joined Kumar whose portal has been regularly monitoring and tracking the real-time location of vehicles so that oxygen reaches hospitals without delay. Using the \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 model to streamline the oxygen supply - the model requires intensive manpower to ensure hassle-free supply \u2013 the shooters are conducting data gathering and entry, GPS Web application monitoring, oxygen tanker location tracking and monitoring with regional transport office (RTO) and medical department. Kumar said in the \u2018hub and spoke\u2019 model, the state has been divided into five hubs \u2013 Lucknow, Kanpur, Modinagar, Ghaziabad and Varanasi - for route optimization. Gorakhpur and Bareilly are functioning as co-hubs. \u201cEach hub comprises 5-6 cities. The spokes are 57 medical colleges across UP where the demand for oxygen has increased. This model is flexible to allow modifications in case of any fluctuations in oxygen demand. The creation of an additional hub requires approximately 9-10 hours of turnaround time,\u201d said Kumar. The shooters remain present at the oxygen manufacturing facilities where the tracking devices are installed and enabled. These devices ensure minimum turnaround times and facilitate end-to-end coordination between multiple departments for seamless movement of oxygen tankers. \u201cWe are witnessing spike in coronavirus cases across the country. Collaboration is the key to winning the battle against COVID-19. We are contributing by setting up a command centre for oxygen movement across the country like we did successfully for UP,\u201d said Kumar. \u201cIn this endeavor we required volunteers to support us for efficient management of this entire process. I had appealed to all my fellow shooters across India to come forward and support us as volunteers. We have received a very positive response from the community,\u201d he added. Deepak Dubey, who coached many national level shooters appreciated efforts of Kumar and his team. \u201cIt\u2019s a real service to the people of the state by the sportspersons. Such initiatives will go a long way in alleviating the miseries of Covid-19 patients. I urge more people to come forward to join the cause,\u201d he said. "}

The second wave will slow down the near-term economic recovery and could weigh on longer-term growth dynamics, Moody\u2019s said.Issuing a release, it said the negative impact on India\u2019s economic output is expected to be limited to the April-June quarter, followed by a strong rebound in the second half of the year.\u201cAs a result of the negative impact of the second wave, we have revised our real, inflation-adjusted GDP growth forecast down to 9.3 per cent from 13.7 per cent for fiscal 2021 and to 7.9 per cent from 6.2 per cent in fiscal 2022. Over the longer term, we expect growth of around 6 per cent thereafter,\u201d the rating agency added.India, hit by a deadly second wave, saw an increase in the daily number of cases and related fatalities. But in the last two days, the number of cases have been declining.Moody\u2019s also said it expects a wider general government deficit of around 11.8 per cent of the GDP in fiscal 2021, compared with its previous forecast of 10.8 per cent and an estimated 14 per cent in fiscal 2020. The combined impact of slower growth and wider deficit will drive the general government burden to 90 per cent of the GDP in fiscal 2021 which will gradually increase to 92 per cent in fiscal 2023, it said in the release.Apart from Moody\u2019s, two other agencies have also predicted a downfall in India\u2019s GDP growth in the current financial year due to the deadlier second wave of the pandemic.Rating agency Crisil said on Tuesday the GDP might drop to 8.2 per cent in financial year 2021-22 if the second wave peaks by the end of June. On the other hand, Japanese financial services company Nomura on Tuesday slashed the GDP growth to 10.8 per cent from the projected 12.6 per cent and held the Covid-19 lockdowns responsible for this reduction."}

Now and in the future. If you look at the number of births, India has twice as many as China\u2019s children per year. I am very jealous of India frankly.\u201d\u201cPopulation is positive, future population is strength. Not weakness,\u201d said Huang, who has studied and researched on demographics at Johns Hopkins and Harvard universities in the US.Yi Fuxian, a scientist at University of Wisconsin-Madison, has long argued that India\u2019s population has already overtaken China\u2019s because officials here had overestimated the number of births between 1990 and 2016 by almost 90 million.In an email interaction with HT, Yi shared a paper he had written on China\u2019s latest census.\u201cOn May 22, 2017, I was invited to speak at a seminar on demographic situation and economic development organised by Peking University. I said at the symposium that China\u2019s population was overestimated by 90 million (100 million if taking account of Chinese migration to other countries), and India\u2019s population had already overtaken China\u2019s,\u201d he wrote in the paper.India has maintained a fertility rate of around 2.3, which indicates that its population may surpass China\u2019s by 2023 or 2024, He Yafu, an independent demographer told Chinese state media on Tuesday, which is sooner than a UN prediction in 2019 that this would happen by 2027.Some Chinese demographers also predicted that India\u2019s population may overtake that of China as early as in 2022. Huang said that in the future, India will experience a sharp decline in fertility rate. \u201cWhen India gets richer, I think you also need to handle this problem. But now I think the people in India have the mindset of China 30 years ago, which is that we have too many people. That\u2019s not the case,\u201d he said.\u201cIndia\u2019s population is certainly young compared to China and bodes well for the future. Demographers call this advantage \u2018demographic dividend\u2019, which means the share of the working age population has risen, implying a fall in dependency ratio. We must learn from China\u2019s experiences and the proven inefficacy of coercive population policies,\u201d Muttreja said.Muttreja said that every year, 12 million to 14 million people enter the workforce in India, and India needs to take advantage of that \u201cdividend\u201d.For that, India should invest in quality education, particularly for girls, different skill-building initiatives, and identifying employment pathways. Women\u2019s empowerment and a greater gender equitable environment will assist girls and young women to complete their education, delay marriage and pregnancy and enter the labour force, she argued.\u201cStepping up investments in health, nutrition, and social conditions will naturally result in fertility decline and help India achieve its development goals,\u201d she added."}

One of the factors for the increase in cyclone intensity and frequency is warmer sea surface temperature (SST), said IMD scientists. Studies have also highlighted that pre-monsoon cyclones in the Arabian Sea are increasing.Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general, said that normally the frequency of cyclones in the Arabian Sea is one every year.\u201cHowever, for this cyclogenesis, it is very early to say what path the cyclone will take and what the intensity will be. We have issued an early warning so that fishermen can be cautioned from venturing out to sea from May 14. IMD will be issuing updated forecasts of the same, from time to time,\u201d said Dr Mohapatra.Vineet Kumar Singh, a scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), who has published a paper on warmer sea surface temperatures (SST) and subsurface temperatures being responsible for the rapid intensification of cyclones that India has witnessed in the recent past, said that we can expect the Arabian Sea to witness more cyclones each year.\u201cThe intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea is also rapidly increasing due to warmer sea surface temperature. In 2020, we witnessed the Nisarga Cyclone, which was a category 1 cyclone. Though it is early to predict the path of this upcoming cyclone, the weather department has issued a warning to inform fishermen not to venture out to sea,\u201d said Singh.He added that based on various national and international models, there is a possibility that this cyclone will be more intense than Cyclone Nisarga.\u201cHowever, the intensity of the cyclone can be predicted only in the next few days, as the conditions get clearer. Due to the rotation axis of the earth, many cyclones in Arabian Sea take a path towards Yemen and Oman,\u201d said Singh.He added that in 2007, Cyclone Gonu which was developed in the pre-monsoon Arabian Sea was a category 3 cyclone and had a wind speed of about 180-200km per hour.\u201cIt is the Arabian sea where an increase in intensity of cyclones is observed,\u201d said Singh.Another study by Researchers at University of Virginia, USA, published in the journal Nature in 2011 states that there is an increase in the intensity of pre-monsoon tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea during the period 1979\u20132010. The study shows that the change in storm strength is a consequence of a simultaneous upward trend in anthropogenic black carbon and sulphate emissions.Cyclone watch* A low pressure area is likely to form over southeast Arabian Sea around May 14* Likely to move north-north-westwards across southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep area and intensify into a depression around May 15. * It may intensify into a cyclonic storm over east central Arabian Sea around May 16 and continue to move north north-westward.

The conflict escalated relentlessly throughout the day, and Israel vowed that its strikes would only increase.The latest exchange of fire was sparked by weeks of tensions in contested Jerusalem.Since sundown Monday, 26 Palestinians \u2014 including nine children and a woman\u2014 were killed in Gaza, most by airstrikes, Gaza health officials said. The Israeli military said at least 16 of the dead were militants. During the same period, Gaza militants fired hundreds of rockets toward Israel, killing two Israeli civilians and wounding 10 others.But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warning in the evening that more was coming. He said after meeting with senior defense officials that Israel would \u201cincrease even more the strength of the strikes and also the rate of the strikes\u201d against Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants in the Gaza Strip.\u201cHamas will receive blows now that it didn\u2019t expect,\u201d he said in a statement.In a further sign of rising tensions, Israel signaled it is widening its military campaign. The military said it is sending troop reinforcements to the Gaza border and the defense minister ordered the mobilization of 5,000 reserve soldiers.Even as the two sides ramped up tensions, officials said Egypt was working on brokering a cease-fire.The barrage of rockets and airstrikes was preceded by hours of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces, including dramatic confrontations at Jerusalem\u2019s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a sacred site to both Jews and Muslims. The current violence, like previous rounds, including the last intifada, or uprising, has been fueled by conflicting claims over Jerusalem, which is at the emotional core of the long conflict.In a sign of widening unrest, hundreds of residents of Arab communities across Israel staged overnight demonstrations \u2014 denouncing the recent actions of Israeli security forces against Palestinians. It was one of the largest protests by Palestinian citizens in Israel in recent years.Israel and Hamas, an Islamic militant group that seeks Israel\u2019s destruction, have fought three wars and numerous skirmishes since Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007. Recent rounds of fighting have usually ended after a few days, often helped by behind-the-scenes mediation by Qatar, Egypt and others.An Egyptian official confirmed that the country was trying to broker a truce. But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing sensitive diplomacy, said Israeli actions in Jerusalem had complicated those efforts. A Palestinian security official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the cease-fire efforts.Even before he vowed more strikes, Netanyahu had warned that fighting could \u201ccontinue for some time.\u201d Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israeli military spokesman, told reporters Tuesday that the military was in \u201cthe early stages\u201d of its strikes.Israel carried out dozens of airstrikes, including two that targeted high-rise buildings where militants were believed to be hiding.At midday, an airstrike hit an apartment building in central Gaza City. Local media said an unknown number of militants had been killed. But the force of the blast sent terrified residents, including women and children who were barefoot, running into the streets.An earlier airstrike struck a high-rise elsewhere in Gaza City as people were conducting dawn prayers, residents said. Health officials said two men and a woman were killed. The woman\u2019s 19-year-old disabled son was among the dead, residents said.Ashraf al-Kidra, spokesman for the Gaza Health Ministry, said a total of 26 people, including nine children and the woman, were killed and 122 people were wounded. He said Israel's \u201crelentless assault\u201d was overwhelming the health care system, which has been struggling with a COVID-19 outbreak.The escalation comes at a time of political limbo in Israel.Netanyahu has been acting as a caretaker prime minister since an inconclusive parliamentary election in March. He tried and failed to form a coalition government with his hard-line and ultra-Orthodox allies, and the task was handed to his political rivals last week.One of those rivals is Israel\u2019s defense minister, who is overseeing the Gaza campaign. It was not clear whether the toxic political atmosphere is spilling over into military decision-making, though the rival camps have unanimously expressed support for striking Hamas hard.The support of an Arab-backed party with Islamist roots is key for the anti-Netanyahu bloc\u2019s efforts. But the current tensions might deter the party\u2019s leader, Mansour Abbas, from joining a coalition for now. The sides have three more weeks to reach a deal.The current round of violence in Jerusalem coincided with the start of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in mid-April.Critics say heavy-handed police measures helped stoke nightly unrest, including a decision to temporarily seal off a popular gathering spot where Palestinian residents would meet after evening prayers. Another flashpoint was the Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where dozens of Palestinians are under treat of eviction by Jewish settlers.Over the weekend, confrontations erupted at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which is the third holiest site of Islam and the holiest site in Judaism.Over several days, Israel police fired tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets at Palestinians in the compound who hurled stones and chairs. At times, police fired stun grenades into the carpeted mosque.On Monday evening, Hamas began firing rockets from Gaza, setting off air raid sirens as far as Jerusalem. From there on, the escalation was rapid.Conricus, the army spokesman, said Gaza militants fired more than 250 rockets at Israel, with about one-third falling short and landing in Gaza.The army said that a rocket landed a direct hit on a seven-story apartment block in the coastal Israeli city of Ashkelon. Israeli paramedic service Magen David Adom said it treated six people injured in the rocket strike. Two were hospitalized in moderate condition.Later, a second building in the city of Ashdod was hit, lightly wounding four people, Israeli police said.Conricus said the military hit 130 targets in Gaza, including two tunnels militants were digging under the border with Israel. He said Israel\u2019s new system of concrete barriers and electronic sensors, intended to thwart tunnel digging, has proven effective.He did not address Gaza Health Ministry reports about the dead children.In Gaza, most of the deaths were attributed to airstrikes. However, seven of the deaths were members of a single family, including three children, who died in an explosion in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun. It was not clear if the blast was caused by an Israeli airstrike or errant rocket.Dozens of mourners took part in the funeral of Hussein Hamad, an 11-year-old boy who was among the dead.More than 100 Gazans were wounded in the airstrikes, the Health Ministry said.Israel struck scores of Gaza homes in its 2014 war with Hamas, arguing it was aiming at militants, but also killing many civilians.

In one incident, a complainant was duped of 2 lakh through UPI scam when all he wanted was a refund for the cancellation of his ticket. He was struggling to find a customer care number and obtained a number from Google search results. He received a call and was asked to download a mobile application called Team Viewer Quick Support on his cell phone. After following the steps told by the fraudsters, he was duped of 2 lakh from his bank account. The victim immediately reported the fraud,\u201d the police spokesman said in a statement.He said that Cyber Police Kashmir was able to recover the money from the fraudsters.\u201cIn OTP frauds, multiple complaints were received regarding vishing (OTP) scams wherein the complainants get phone calls from fraudsters claiming to be bank officers. These fraudsters convince the complainants and inform them that their debit cards have been blocked and are due for renewal. In order to renew the debit cards, the complainants are asked to share the card details along with six digits OTP received on their cell phones. The gullible victims end up sharing their card details along with OTP and fall prey to such scams. An amount of 11 lakh was duped similarly,\u201d the police said.Police said amid the Covid-19 pandemic, when the public is dependent on cyber platforms, the vulnerability of getting trapped into cyber scams/frauds gets increased.\u201cPublic is advised to refrain from downloading any remote access apps like Team viewer quick support, Anydesk App etc. or dialling fake helpline or customer care numbers found on Google search engine. These legitimate apps are remote software tools which provide a third party with complete hold of the users\u2019 cell phones and computer. People are advised to be aware of these latest scams and not to fell prey to these fraudsters. If you or your family member get infected from Corona, you may receive a fraud call from cyber criminals that Covid-19 help will be provided, moreover, fraudsters may also ask for an advance payment and promise to provide an oxygen cylinder via home delivery, vaccines etc,\u201d the police statement said."}
