I again urge centre to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi. Some hospitals left with just a few hours of oxygen,\" the chief minister said on Twitter.He had earlier made a similar appeal to the Centre, saying that hospitals in the national capital are running low on oxygen as well as ICU beds.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also took to Twitter to red flag the oxygen crisis in Delhi, saying that SOS calls are coming in from several hospitals over short supply.\"People supplying oxygen are being stopped in different states. There should be no jungle raj between states on the supply of oxygen. For this, the central government will have to be very sensitive and active,\" Sisodia said.In a separate tweet, Sisodia attached a list of hospitals in the national capital where only a few hours of oxygen supply is left.\"In most hospitals in Delhi, oxygen is available only for the next 8 to 12 hours. We have been demanding for one week to increase the oxygen supply quota to Delhi, which the central government has to do,\" Sisodia said.The AAP government's appeal comes just hours after the Centre told the Delhi high court that there is no gap in oxygen supply to the national capital at present and its use has been banned for industrial purposes.The Union health ministry told the court that there has been an inordinate increase of 133 per cent in the projected medical oxygen required, as on April 20, between the initial estimate of 300 metric tonnes and revised estimate of 700 metric tonnes submitted by Delhi.The court had questioned the Centre over reports that doctors at Ganga Ram Hospital were being forced to reduce oxygen being given to Covid-19 patients amid scarcity.The national capital is witnessing a severe second wave of infections over the last few weeks. On Monday, Delhi had reported over 23,600 new infections."}

Among people aged 30-40, the incidence of infection remains unchanged at 21% during both the waves.In case of hospitalised patients, younger people (0-39 years) are slightly more vulnerable in the second wave as compared to the first despite opening up of economic activities and general movement. Around 5.8% of patients hospitalised are 0-19 years, compared to 4.2% in the first wave. Similarly, hospitalised cases in the 20-39 bracket increased to 25.5% from 23.7% earlier.Around 70% hospitalised patients in both waves are 40 and above, indicating that older people continue to be more vulnerable.The data also shows a higher proportion of asymptomatic patients got admitted in hospitals in the second wave with more complaints of breathlessness. The percentage of deaths in hospitalised patients remains unchanged during the interim analysis of the second wave conducted on 1,885 people during March-April. The analysis of the first wave was done on 7,600 people during September-November 2020.According to the analysis of hospitalised Covid-19 patients by the Indian Council of Medical Research, 47.5% patients have reported shortness of breath during the second wave, against 41.7% in the first wave, explaining the recent rise in demand for oxygen.A total of 41.1% of patients during the first wave required oxygen, with the share rising to 54.5% in the second, the demographic study based on data collected from 40 centres across the country shows. It also found that 37.3% hospitalised patients required mechanical ventilation during the second wave, whereas the number was 27.8% in the first wave.Almost 55% of the patients in the first wave had at least one comorbidity. However, during the second wave, the share of such patients dropped to 48.6%."}

The state governments that have announced lockdowns to tackle rising Covid-19 cases have mandated that only essential items can be sold online and offline. Essential items include medicines, food items, sanitary products and other day-to-day household items. Mobile phones, laptops, routers, batteries, appliances and all other electronics do not come in this essentials list and are hence barred from being sold online.With mobile and electronics shops closed, people have no choice to buy electronic items online. So, state governments have taken this decision to ensure a level playing field for both online and offline businesses.Earlier this month, as coronavirus cases begun to rise and the speculations of likely lockdown started, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) wrote a mail to minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal to intervene and ensure that e-commerce companies like Amazon Flipkart and others too are not allowed to deliver non-essential goods in states where curfew is imposed. The trade body said that this is extremely \u201cimportant to maintain parity between online and offline trade.\u201dCAIT represents over eight crore traders across India through 40,000 trade associations. The trade body in its letter to the minister said that e-commerce companies may \u201cpressurise\u201d the governments, through lobby groups, to allow sale and delivery of non-essential goods in places where lockdown and curfews have been imposed.While e-commerce majors like Amazon and Flipkart have stopped deliveries of all electronic goods and are only sticking to selling essential items for pincodes of Delhi and Maharashtra; the online stores of chains like Croma, Reliance Digital and others are either showing most electronic goods as out of stock or are deferring delivery dates to May 2021 the moment a buyer selects pincodes of these cities.Individual online stores like those of Apple and Xiaomi too have shut deliveries entirely for Delhi and Maharashtra residents while other smartphone brands are showing delayed delivery dates.Laptop brands like HP and Lenovo have stopped deliveries while Dell is showing most items as \u2018out-of-stock\u2019. Acer is showing delivery dates of at least April 27 for buyers in these regions.Major e-commerce platforms shutting down deliveries for electronics items in Delhi and Maharashtra could be concerning given that most employees are working from home in these two regions."}

He demanded immediate measures to provide more treatment facilities in the light of rising number of patients.Puglia appreciated the approach of Chandrapur MLA Kishor Jorgewar, who donated Rs1 crore from his MLA fund for building Covid hospitals in the light of hassles faced by patients and their relatives in finding a bed.Puglia pointed out that there are two Lok Sabha members, 5 MLAs, and two MLCs from the district. If each of the MLAs provides Rs1 crore and each MP gives Rs2 crore, then it would add up to Rs11 crore. In addition, essential grants from mining royalty fund can be contributed for the construction 500-bed jumbo Covid hospital, he said.He also suggested taking the help of some private agency to build the 500-bed Covid hospital. He warned that if the administration fails to do so, entire responsibility of deaths and hassles faced by relatives of patients will lie upon them.MLA Jorgewar too has pitched for hassle-free permissions to private hospitals ready to build Covid treatment facilities. In letters sent to CM Uddhav Thackeray and health minister Rajesh Tope, he demanded that administration should set aside stringent conditions laid down to build Covid hospital.The MLA claimed that many private hospitals have applied to set up Covid treatment facility, however stringent permission process has delayed their efforts. If these hospitals are given permission, Chandrapur can have additional facility of around 300 beds, Jorgewar has pointed out."}

On Monday, one of the workers in a fair price shop died due to Covid. He was just 26 years old. There are at least 40 workers in different shops who have tested positive and now we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t risk our lives. This is all happening because those beneficiaries are pressing their thumbs on the biometric machine, which is being handled by us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aggrawal.When asked why the machine is not being sanitized after every use, Aggrawal said it leads to technical issues. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have tried this many times and after just one sanitization session, the biometric machine becomes unusable for 15 minutes. The next person\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thumb is not being read by the software thus creating bottlenecks for us,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aggrawal.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThough we decided to go on strike from May 1, many of our members have started depositing their POS at our association\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office from today itself. They say that Covid-19 cases are rising steadily and the longer they wait, more are the chances of they getting infected,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aggawal.RDS says that reverting to the offline mode of beneficiary identification is the only way out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been pressing for this change to offline mode for the last few months. Our association wrote to the district collector and also to minister Chhagan Bhujbal who heads the department. But till date the government has not responded,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Aggrawal.District collector Ravindra Thakre cofirmed that the association has been in touch with him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have forwarded their proposal to the government. Whatever decision is taken will be applicable to the entire state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Thakre.Aggrawal added that the biometric system was introduced in 2015. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSince then, every beneficiary has to be authenticated through the thumb biometric process. Around 3.8 lakh beneficiaries are eligible to get essential foodgrains through our fair price shops,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said."}

A detailed study of cases and deaths in Vidarbha shows that the municipal corporation areas or even semi-urban areas account for less than 40% of the deaths in the last five days. Above 60% deaths are coming from the rural/tribal and hilly regions especially in the last two weeks. Cases, however, are more from urban/semi-urban region.\n\nIn the last 5 days, Nagpur (426), Bhandara (108), Gondia (101) and Yavatmal (128) have reported highest deaths in Vidarbha region. Only in Nagpur, 60% deaths have been reported from Nagpur City (municipal corporation area) while 40% are from Nagpur rural and other state/region patients.\n\nIn Yavatmal, 72 out of 128 deaths (56%) reported from rural areas (not even Tehsil headquarters but villages). In Bhandara, 63 of 108 (58%) deaths are from rural area (Gram Pachayat villages). In Chandrapur, 35% deaths are from Municipal corporation limits while 75% are from rural area. Similar is the data from Akola, Washim, and Amravati.\n\nThis indicates that the Covid-19 has spread badly in rural Vidarbha. Experts said that many deaths must have gone unreported in rural areas as people perform last rites of their relatives in villages without informing authorities. The difference in number of new cases reported supports this claim.\n\nOut of more than 70k new cases reported in last five days, majority of cases (39,300) are from urban (Municipal council/corporation) areas. This means, many cases in rural Vidarbha are going unreported and people are coming late to hospitals.\n\nBhandara district collector Sandip Kadam confirmed this. According to him, many people in the district, especially from rural areas are dying out of fear of the Covid-19.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople are reporting late in a critical condition from the rural parts of the district. I appeal to them to not avoid treatment and hide symptoms. Early treatment is the key,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kadam. The collector also told that increased tests are bringing more cases.\n\nDoctors said that the need of the hour is to concentrate on rural health infrastructure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least ensure supply of basic preventive medicines like vitamin C and zinc to rural health centers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr Naresh Kolhe, who works for an NGO in Amravati.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople still have the fear and stigma about Covid-19 in rural/tribal regions. If we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t act fast, the rural spread of Covid-19 will be scary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe entire health system is focusing on cities, availability of O2, medicines etc. in urban hospitals. Rural health centres should at least have first line medicines,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a senior doctor from the divisional health department in Nagpur.\n\nRURAL SPREAD\n\n* 1,098 deaths in last 5 days (April 15-19); 600+ are from rural (Tehsil places, Gram Panchayat Villages)\n\n* In Yavatmal, Akola, Chandrapur and Bhandara, many Covid-19 deaths\n\n* In Chandrapur, Gadchiroli and Gondia, deaths are being reported from tribal-dominated region\n\n* A large number of Covid-19 deaths in rural Vidarbha might have been unreported\n\n*As cases are also more from rural region, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to strengthen health infrastructure in villages\n\n"}

The officer got the cylinders to the hospital that had barely two hours\u00e2\u0080\u0099 supply left by virtually robbing an oxygen plant.\n\nIt is learnt the management of the Nimunabai Tirpude Hospital sent a message to Jaripatka police station shortly after the Sunday midnight that lives of 15 Covid patients was at risk as oxygen supply may not last after 5 am. The hospital received its regular oxygen supply from a Mouda-based plant which was not responding to their repeated calls, said Dr Shivaji Supalkar of the Tirpude Hospital.

The control room informed Naikwade about an oxygen plant at Yashodhara Nagar where the the officer landed up with his team.\n\nThe Yashodhara Nagar plant was unwilling to spare any cylinder because an earlier order from collector had asked all oxygen plants to supply only as per quota allotted to hospital by his office. PSI Naikwade, emotionally moved by the situation, forcibly took seven oxygen cylinders and delivered them to Tirpude Hospital.\n\nThough his act may have saved lives, it did not go down well with the senior officials as there were some gross violations involved including that of collector\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders.\n\nThe hospital authorities said they were panicked by the situation and approached the cops fearing anger by patient\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kin if something untoward happened. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe PSI\u00e2\u0080\u0099s act ensured oxygen for our patients and we are ready to pay whatever amount is due.

There are various problems in transporting it from Wardha to city and filling oxygen in jumbo cylinders. Therefore, Jumbo Covid Hospital will begin in the plant premises with 200 beds, which will go up to 1,000 beds in a phased manner.

Four tankers with 15 metric tonne arrived on Monday, from which we also distributed to Gondia, Wardha and Chhindwara. More tankers are coming from Bhilai steel plant .

The civic body postponed this due to shortage of oxygen. Raut said oxygen tanks will be established at Pachpaoli Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hospital, where liquid oxygen will be filled in tanks and given to patients so that there is no requirement of refilling jumbo oxygen cylinders.On testing, Raut said medical education minister Amit Deshmukh has assured to provide CRISPR Feluda machine, which will facilitate results of RT-PCR within 30 minutes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accuracy is 95%,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the minister said.On shortage of Remdisivir drug, Raut said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a crisis across the country. Production is less due to shortage of raw material from foreign countries. District got 3,000 vials which will be distributed tomorrow. I requested two companies to send 25,000 vials. We approved production at Wardha plant but it will take at least 14 days for sterilization. District may get stock from this plant from May 10 onwards, subject to availability of raw material,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.Municipal commissioner Radhakrishnan B issued an order on Monday reducing timings of essential shops."}

The course of treatment had to be modified by prescribing the available drugs, often leading to a delayed and even incomplete recuperation, they said.\n\nThe statistics shared by the district information office also underlined the fact that during the period of drug shortage there had been an increase in number of patients in hospitals. Till the midnight of April 14, there had been 13,672 patients in different Covid hospitals, which increased to 14,079 on April 15. After a brief drop on April 16, there was another leap the following day with 15,247 patients in hospital. The number further increased to 20,246 as on April 18.\n\nDr Pinak Dande of the Dande Hospital said the patients cannot be discharged or are not willing to take discharge until and unless they feel cured and safe. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWithout completion of the treatment course, the patients are not cured and are also not safe to be discharged,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe patient feels psychologically unsafe if a crucial drug like Remdesivir is not being administered as per the treatment guidelines.

He has also urged the oxygen suppliers to first deliver at the Covid hospitals and then to the patients isolated at home.\n\n"}

Activists of Citizens for Animal Protection Foundation have lodged an FIR at Rabodi police station against unknown persons for animal cruelty.\n\n\"After the medical treatment of the puppy, it was released back at its original spot at Masanwada, near Castle Mill area of Thane last Wednesday. However, the next day (Thursday) when our volunteer Atharva Prabhavale went back to the site to check the puppy, he was shocked to find the animal dead and its body partially burned and put inside a carton box. We have pictorial evidence of this cruelty,\" said Sushank Tomar of CAP Foundation.\n\nHe further added that initially the police was reluctant to file an FIR, but after the activists insisted that this was a case of animal cruelty, the complaint was lodged at Rabodi police station under section 429 of the Indian Penal Code and section 11(1)(a) of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act , 1960.\n\nThe activists suspect that some animal haters from the nearby areas may have killed the puppy; and hence have urged the police to fully inquire into it and also check the CCTV camera footages.\n\nBurning animals is a common violent crime that must be curbed. Research shows that people who commit acts of cruelty to animals are often repeat offenders who move on to hurting other animals, including humans. In a study of domestic violence victims, 60% of women said that their abusive partners had harmed or killed their dogs or other animals. According to statistics released by the National Crime Records Bureau , nearly 8,000 women are killed every year through \u00e2\u0080\u009cbride burning\u00e2\u0080\u009d after dowry-related disputes.\n\n"}

She is slated to go to Australia for pursuing masters in computer engineering course commencing May. But the pendency of the DV case creates hurdles for her to get her visa, her advocate Kenny Thakkar submitted.\n\nThe judges noted that the mother filed a DV case against the father. Although she arraigned the daughter, there was only one allegation against her. The mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reply said it is not necessary for the daughter to go abroad for further studies and she is using this excuse to avoid legal proceedings. She also made statements on the daughter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character and that she has many boyfriends. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe petitioner is a young lady who has just graduated and her future depends upon how she is able to improve her educational qualifications and develop her personality\u00e2\u0080\u00a6It is surprising that her own mother is hell-bent upon creating obstructions in her progress,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Justice Pitale wrote for the bench.\n\nThe judges said it appears that the single allegation of assault against the daughter is an exaggeration and it arose out of anger as she continued to stay with her father. There is nothing to indicate its veracity or even genuineness of photographs annexed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, the tenor of the reply does show that the respondent (mother) is not positively disposed towards her own daughter and it is for this reason that she has levelled allegations against her daughter pertaining to her character and other such things. We do not wish to comment on the same. But, it is evident that the petitioner is caught in the crossfire of acrimony and matrimonial discord between the respondent and her husband, who is the father of the petitioner,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the bench,\n\nThe judges concluded that in the facts and circumstances of the case the allegations, borne out of marital discord, can be said to be improbable and fall under category 5 of SC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s judgment in Bhajan Lal case where it laid categories where HC can quash proceedings. They directed quashing of the DV case pending against the daughter before the magistrate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s court.\n\n"}

The PIL has raised serious concerns about the control and spread of the pandemic,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni told the government pleader.The PIL filed by advocate Sneha Marjadi has highlighted the difficulties faced by patients and their relatives in procuring beds and also mentioned the shortage of oxygen and the unavailability of Remdesivir injection which is one of the important drugs for treatment of Covid-19 patients.She gave her personal example after she tested positive about the delay in receiving results of the rapid antigen test and how her husband was asked by a nursing home to bring a doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prescription to take the test.On April 18 her aunt was hospitalised and the hospital asked them to arrange for 6 vials of Remdesivir.Marjadi and her relatives in vain made all efforts, including posting on social media to get the injections.Her petition alleged that some hospitals and doctors are black marketing Ramdesivir injections at high rates taking advantage of the situation.She urged the high court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention \u00e2\u0080\u009cto monitor the supply of the injection by pharmaceutical companies and procurement by the respondents and/or hospitals at consistent price all over the state to stop black marketing and panic situation about the unavailability.\u00e2\u0080\u009dAlso, to call for a status report on availability of beds in hospitals, laboratory test facilities, procurement of Remdesivir injections and oxygen.Marjadi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s petition cited Bombay HC's Nagpur bench\u00e2\u0080\u0099s April 13, 2021 order in a suo motu PIL regarding the centralisation and administering dosage of Remdesivir in Nagpur.A reference was also made to the high courts of Gujarat and Allahabad taking suo motu cognisance of the multiple difficulties in the management of Covid-19.Advocate Arshil Shah, appearing for Marjadi, submitted that only after Nagpur bench\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention some 10,000 vials were made available last night.\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople have been losing their lives waiting for beds.

Are you interested in the poor, underprivileged and needy or you want to highlight a political issue?\u00e2\u0080\u009d the CJ asked.Shah said he will omit the relevant pages on the politician\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tweets.The judges said the PIL should have been confined only for the benefit of the people concerned and the petitioner being an advocate should have been careful.\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat politicians do we know very well\u00e2\u0080\u00a6We are not influenced by political comments,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said the CJ.Posting the hearing on Thursday, the judges also asked that BMC and the Centre keep its responses ready."}

Shrikant told TOI he will never forget the six harrowing hours spent outside Bhabha Hospital in Bandra that couldn't admit his father since they had run out of oxygen. His father passed away at 2.30pm, about four hours after they had set out in search of an oxygen bed.Deepak Mhatre had tested positive for malaria last week and hence the family didn't suspect Covid-19 when he developed fever and other symptoms. On Sunday morning, though, he became breathless. Shrikant said they contacted the ward war room around 8am but were told no oxygen beds were available. \"They said they would check with a few hospitals and inform us. Since it didn't happen till 10am, we headed to Bhabha,\" said the son.On reaching Bhabha, the family was told the hospital had run out of oxygen since Friday and hence were not admitting any patients who may need it. \"My dad was wearing the pulse oximeter on his finger. His saturation had dropped to 55%. We felt helpless and started making calls everywhere,\" Shrikant said.Shrikant added that they stayed put in the hospital thinking they would directly head to one that had a bed. An added impediment was not having a Covid-positive report, the son said.Srikant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cousin Santosh, who made calls to half a dozen private hospitals and ward war rooms, said there was no guidance on what they could do next. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEveryone kept on asking for a Covid report,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Santosh said. They even went to enquire at the BKC jumbo centre where staffers told them that beds are only allocated through the ward war rooms. They finally arranged an acquaintance to come and do an antigen test outside Bhabha Hospital, hoping that could aid in getting a bed.In the meantime, as Deepak complained of his worsening breathlessness, they purchased a portable can that holds about 8 litre oxygen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoon as we gave that, his oxygen level showed some improvement, but the can lasted less than ten minutes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Santosh said. They once again rushed him to Bhabha around 2.15pm, where he collapsed and passed away in the casualty. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHad we found an oxygen bed, we could have saved him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the son said. Deepak is survived by his wife, two sons, daughtersin-law and grandchildren.Dr P Jadhav, superintendent of Bandra Bhabha, said they have had to shift patients since Friday for want of oxygen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have completely stopped admitting patients who require oxygen. This family was told to contact the ward war room and they would help them find a bed.\u00e2\u0080\u009dMumbai\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daily oxygen need has hit 235 tonne.

Even drivers have been kept on standby so that vehicles, especially those carrying oxygen, are on the move,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Singh added.\n\n"}

He has also created 150 fake company websites that use similar modus operandi.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fake and genuine websites look similar.

The constable\u00e2\u0080\u0099s partially charred body was found from a house in a slum colony at Santacruz (W) in 2014, which the prosecution claimed was rented by the accused.\n\nHowever, acquitting the woman, the court said there was no proof that the accused was seen in the company of the victim before his death or that the woman lived in that house at any point of time.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c...The prosecution has not succeeded to prove the chain of events to provide conclusive and satisfactory evidence that the accused was involved in committing homicide of victim. The prosecution has also not succeeded to prove that after killing the victim , the accused had tried to destroy evidence of murder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the court said. The woman was out on bail.\n\nIt was the prosecution\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case that the woman sedated the victim, strangled him and then burnt the corpse on the intervening night of September 11 and 12, 2014. People had gathered outside the house in the afternoon after they saw smoke emitting from there. The body was found in a rolled mattress inside the bathroom. It was alleged that the house was rented to the accused. The prosecution also alleged that the woman had claimed the victim owed her Rs 20 lakh and threatened to make her intimate video viral if she didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay Rs 20,000 every month. The woman denied the allegations and submitted that she was falsely implicated.\n\nWhile the prosecution submitted that sleeping pills were recovered from the woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purse, the court said there was no direct evidence that the accused had actually administered those sedatives to the victim. The court also said the coroner in his deposition had not spoken about finding any traces of sedatives in the victim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body.\n\nIt further said that there was no evidence to show that the woman was living in the room where the victim was found. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs domestical and personal usable articles were not found in the room, therefore, prosecution could not prove that the accused lady was living there at any point of time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the court said.\n\nThe court also pointed out that neither was the mattress produced before the court nor did the mattress selle depose during trial. The court said this nullified the argument that the accused had purchased the mattress from a shop close by.\n\nThe court also questioned how a man, claiming to have seen the woman alighting from a rickshaw with the mattress near that house, remembered its pattern after five years. In court, the man had identified a piece of cloth purportedly taken from the mattress. \u00e2\u0080\u009c During cross-examination, he said he was facing a criminal case. The probability, as per the defence, is that the evidence by this witness is suspicious and therefore not acceptable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the court said.\n\n"}

Data with the agency's Anti Phishing Unit received 5226 complaints between April 2019 and March 2021.A phishing attack involves sending fraudulent communication like texts or emails that appear to have come from a reputable source. The goal is to steal sensitive data or to install malware. \"As people were grounded and spent a large part of 2020 in front of the screen, cyberscamsters became more active,\" said a senior official with Maharashtra Cyber.But lawyers believe that the actual number of phishing attacks occurring in the state are far more than those being reported to Maharashtra Cyber's portal. \"The agency's portal (reportphishing.in) has not been publicized enough,\" says cyber lawyer Prashant Mali. \"The Anti Phishing Unit should also make data available on how many complaints received by them eventually convert into FIRs. For a victim of cyber crime, what matters the most is getting his money back and the process of law cannot begin without registration of an FIR,\" he added.A few lawyers have been utilizing a provision in the Information Technology (IT) Act to seek monetary relief for their clients. The IT Act gives powers to an adjudicating authority (principal IT secretary for Maharashtra) to hold an enquiry and adjudicate matters where claims do not exceed Rs 5 crore. \"A civil complaint can be filed and compensation sought where corporates have failed to protect sensitive personal data (such as a bank in case of a banking fraud or a telecom company in case of a Sim swap fraud),\" Mali said.Cybercrimes in India had caused a financial loss of Rs 1.25 lakh crore in 2019. \"Most malware attacks in India begin through phishing,\" says Sivarama Krishnan, partner and leader, cyber security, PwC India. Organisations are doing their bit to tackle phishing by installing filters that throw out phishing emails before they reach employees. Some are training employees on the do's and dont's.\"The golden rule is to not click on dubious links nor share passwords/ OTPs,\" says lawyer Vicky Shah. \"The government also needs to make stringent norms for the issue of duplicate Sim cards ,\" he added. Sim swap frauds could also begin with a phishing attack. A phishing email is first sent to get the user's banking details. To use these details, the fraudster clones the user's mobile Sim card to get access to his texts. At present, any street side vendor offers to sell Sim cards.Among other complaints reported to the Anti Phishing Unit, about 7% involved users losing money in the lure of winning lotteries, 5% complaints pertained to employment scams where users keyed in details on fake job portals, 3% were investment related scams and 2% frauds mentioned government schemes. The Anti Phishing Unit coordinates with nodals of cyber police stations across India and overseas to help resolve or report such cases."}

If given early before saturation of oxygen falls, it has harmful effect. Covid patients who got steroids early had higher mortality than those who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. It is of no use if steroids are given on day one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he further added.\n\nUnderlining the clinical learnings so far, Dr Guleria maintained that it is important to use drugs based on evidence gathered so far. The comments come in the wake of rising concerns about huge shortage of medicines like Tocilizumab , Remdesivir and even in oxygen supply.\n\n"}

The Anand Vihar bus terminal saw chaotic scenes with people jostling for space on the foot overbridges and scrambling to take the first bus out or board a train.The weekend curfew had set the return journey to their homes in motion but on Monday it acquired an urgency. This time, however, they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to trudge it back home. The trains are running, albeit for those with confirmed tickets, and buses too are available.Delhi Covid lockdown news: Live updatesThe Anand Vihar terminal became the epicentre with thousands of people turning up to leave the city. There was barely any space to plant your foot on the stairs and overbridges. The mad rush at Kaushambi, from where buses leave for UP towns, right across the road from Anand Vihar, only added to the chaos. Home-bound people there were seen scaling the walls to enter the terminal and grab a place on a bus. All Covid precautions were thrown to the wind.Migrant worker Rajesh, who had his wife and daughter with him, said he was returning home since a lockdown had been announced and the panchayat elections were also scheduled to be held. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are saying one week now but we really don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better that I return home. At least my family will survive and get food,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, before catching a bus to Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh.Many labourers from Gorakhpur who were taking a bus home said they had gone to factories in search of work but were told to return later. They said last year they had walked for miles to reach home but this time the buses were available. Since there is no money and food, there was no point staying back, they said, adding that they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe that the government would take care of them.Harendra Singh, DCP, Railways pointed out that \u00e2\u0080\u009cunlike last year, only special trains are running now and hence railway stations are not seeing the kind of rush witnessed last year. Only those who have a valid reservation or ticket are being allowed to enter the railway platforms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. On Sunday, 4,97,500 people boarded around 303 trains to their respective destinations from Delhi. About 43,000 people boarded trains for various destinations from the Anand Vihar railway station.A senior railway official, however, pointed out that people from UP and Bihar usually return home around April-end as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the time for harvesting wheat. Besides, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the marriage season. So, attributing the rush entirely to the lockdown would not be right. However, several migrants who were waiting for buses to return home said they were leaving as they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust the government after what happened last year. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Covid cases are on the rise and more people are dying. They will definitely extend the lockdown and I want to be back home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a worker from Uttar Pradesh.Dr Punit Sethi, estate manager, Anand Vihar ISBT, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn Monday around 20,000 people left for their homes in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand in around 400 buses. Looking at the increasing number, we have added around 600 more buses. We appeal to the people to not panic and stay put but we are also prepared for the rush.\u00e2\u0080\u009dBy Monday afternoon at least 50,000 people had gathered in the hope of catching a bus home. The workers were so desperate to return home that some even paid for sitting on the roof of a bus. A man who was running to catch a bus for Gonda lost both his mobile phones in the melee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow will I inform my parents that I am coming home. We know very well after last year that no one will take care of us and hence I am going back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.The scenario was no different at Sarai Kale Khan and Kashmere Gate bus terminals where students, women and labourers were looking for a way back home. Many students from Sonepat reached Delhi soon after the lockdown was imposed and wanted to take the first bus back home to Bihar. A group of women waiting for a bus to Bundelkhand at Sarai Kale Khan said they have to go back in order to survive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen we are at home, we at least know we can ask someone for help and our children will not starve. Last year, we had to stand in queues and beg for food,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of them.Meanwhile, Delhi Police has said it will take strict action against rumour-mongering regarding the lockdown. Anybody found spreading rumours on social media and Whatsapp etc about the lockdown being extended will not be spared, said officials."}

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal warned that if strict measures were not taken now, the healthcare system could collapse.All non-essential movement, including that of domestic workers, has been prohibited. Public parks, malls, markets, liquor shops, barber shops, saloons, beauty parlours, cinemas, non-essential private offices, etc will remain shut with the aim to break the chain of coronavirus transmission. Public transport like the Metro, buses, cabs and autorickshaws will be allowed to run with a restricted sitting capacity but they can carry only those people who are exempted from the lockdown.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the health system collapses, then I fear we might witness a huge tragedy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the CM at a press conference after discussing the Covid situation with lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal. Kejriwal said he has always been opposed to such lockdowns but the government was left with no other option. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI understand how people lose their jobs and salaries during lockdowns. This is especially difficult for the economically weaker sections and daily wage labourers.\u00e2\u0080\u009dThe last time a lockdown was imposed in the entire country, we saw how a large number of migrant workers began returning to their villages. I would like to appeal to them, with folded hands, that this is a short lockdown, for six days. Please do not leave Delhi. You will lose a lot of time, money and energy in travelling. Stay in Delhi. I strongly believe that this short lockdown would not be extended,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kejriwal.Among the exemptions that have been granted is the movement of people for marriage- related gatherings. Up to 50 people will be allowed on producing a soft or hard copy of the wedding card while only up to 20 people will be allowed for funeral-related gatherings. All other social, political and religious gatherings have been banned. Visitors have been barred from religious places which, however, can stay open. Bars and restaurants will remain closed but home delivery is allowed.The lockdown was announced the day the weekend lockdown ended. Unlike the 2020 lockdown, this short lockdown does not prohibit interstate travel. People can go to the airport, railway stations and ISBT with a valid ticket and also use public transport services.The chief minister said that with about 25,000 cases being reported daily, the healthcare system of the city has reached its limit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has not collapsed but is under great stress. If strict measures are not taken now, it can collapse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, urging migrant labourers to stay in Delhi and not panic. Kejriwal said the AAP government has been honest and transparent in Covid management and sought the citizens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 cooperation.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the past 24 hours, approximately 23,500 new cases have been reported. The number of beds in the Delhi hospitals is falling short. Less than 100 ICU beds are left and there is a shortage of oxygen as well. One private hospital informed us that around 3am, the night before yesterday, they had almost no oxygen left. They panicked as a huge tragedy could have occurred. It was with great difficulty that they managed to procure oxygen. We are also falling short of medicines, especially Remdesivir ,\" said Kejriwal.The CM stressed that he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wish to scare people but was just spelling out the actual situation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNone of the hospitals can cater to a countless number of patients. We do not want Delhi to face a situation where patients will be lying in the corridors or losing their lives on the streets, at any cost. After reviewing the entire situation, your government feels that a lockdown should be imposed in Delhi for a few days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Kejriwal, hoping that the curbs may help reduce the cases.He said during the lockdown period the government will arrange a large number of beds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are asking the Centre for help and have been in constant touch with them. They are helping us too. We would also utilize this period to arrange for oxygen and medicines. It is a humble request to all that they follow the rules and do not step out of their home,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the CM.According to a DDMA order, which described the lockdown as a curfew, people will be allowed to appear for examinations on producing valid admit cards. For exempted activities, people can get e-passes by applying on the Delhi government website \u00e2\u0080\u0093 www.delhi.gov.in. No epass is needed for moving around on foot for all permitted activities. The e-passes obtained for night curfew or for the weekend curfew will be valid during the week-long lockdown.The Railways on Monday said it has stopped with immediate effect the sale of platform tickets at all major stations in the national capital in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases. The northern railway\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement came hours after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a six-day lockdown, which he said was necessary to deal with the rising number of cases as the city's health system was stretched to its limits. \u00e2\u0080\u009cStoppage of sale of platform tickets includes major railway stations of Delhi i. e. New Delhi, Old Delhi, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Anand Vihar Terminal, etc. The Railways said the trains already in operation would continue to run. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRailways is there to take the last passenger to the destination. There are enough trains running and most of them at very less capacity utilisation. All trains will continue to run,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Railway spokesperson DJ Narain said."}

The committee, also comprising one member each from Delhi Pollution Control Board, Delhi Jal Board, Haryana Pollution Control Board and Haryana Agricultural Board, is to file a report within three days and the bench will examine it on Friday.\n\nThe bench passed the order on a petition by DJB alleging that Haryana was deliberately discharging pollutants in the Yamuna, which resulted in rise of ammonia level in the water. The board said the neighbouring state was taking advantage of its geographical location as an upper riparian state in asserting \"right to pollute the river\".\n\nHaryana government, however, alleged that DJB was diverting water before it reached Wazirabad and blamed the board for lower water level at its Wazirabad plant.

Even on April 4, the ammonia level in Yamuna at the point it enters the Wazirabad reservoir was 4.4 ppm, which is much higher than the ammonia level that the plants of the board can process for purification,\" it said.\n\n"}

Read More\n\nBENGALURU: An undergraduate student with a private college in SG Palya on Hosur Road struggled for over a month to retrieve his luggage from his room in a hostel located on Doddakammanahalli Road, Hulimavu, southeast Bengaluru. Reason: All rooms were locked following a legal tussle between the building owner and the person running the hostel over monetary issues.\n\nThe student approached DCP (southeast) Srinath Mahadev Joshi last week and managed to get his luggage back. His documents were intact but kitchen utensils and a guitar were missing. While this youngster got lucky, another 70 like him are yet to get their belongings, which have been locked up in the hostel rooms for over a year.\n\nThe hostel has two blocks with 14 floors each and houses around 350 students from three different private colleges. Most of them are pursuing BSc or BBA. Each student had in early 2020 paid around Rs 1,88,000 towards hostel fee for 2020-21.\n\nHowever, they all left the hostel and headed back home when the lockdown was announced in March-April 2020.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the hostel occupants returned to their hometowns in different parts of the country. However, most of them came back in October, collected their baggage and returned home as classes were still happening online. But the luggage of many, who failed to come in October, had been kept in locked rooms. Around 70 students, who wish to leave the hostel, have to get back their belongings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an affected student said.\n\nWhile a couple of students managed to get back their stuff after several visits to the hostel, some sought police intervention. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAlong with our study materials and other luggage, documents like original marks cards, Aadhaar and birth certificates are locked in our rooms. Who will be responsible if something happens,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the students.\n\nSome students filed complaints saying their luggage with vital documents have been locked up in the hostel rooms and they needed them back. Jurisdictional Hulimavu police registered the complaints as non-cognizable reports.\n\nThe Hulimavu police inspeHctor called the hostel management over phone, requesting them to return the students\u00e2\u0080\u0099 luggage. Police accompanied students to the hostel, but returned empty-handed as the staff there said they had no idea who had the keys to the locked rooms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a civil matter. A legal battle is going on between the building owner and the person who ran the hostel on contract basis. It is said that the building owner had fixed Rs 30 lakh per month as rental for the entire hostel. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what exactly the legal fight is about; but it is related to rent payment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said inspector Mahesh Kanakagiri.\n\nWhen TOI contacted the president of the hostel, Mahesh, about the issue, he said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are some legal issues and I will ask the person concerned, Sanjay, to talk to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While no such call came, Mahesh too was unreachable later.\n\n"}

Some crew members didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report for duty, anticipating protests at depots.

They will join work from Tuesday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a transport department official.While the protesting employees signalled that they are open to negotiations and want to resolve the strike before Wednesday, the government seemed to be in no mood to compromise.

The government is trying to suppress the strike instead of negotiating with employees.\u00e2\u0080\u009dIn Bengaluru, staff members who came to protest were detained by police.

Read More\n\nBENGALURU: In a reiteration that the rate of infection in the second wave is higher than the first, data shows Karnataka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s average of daily cases so far in April is the highest since the outbreak.\n\nAt 9,114 cases per day, the daily average is 500 more than the highest number recorded during the peak in 2020 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 8,644 in September. Bengaluru numbers also show a similar trend but the difference between the current surge and that in 2020 is far more acute in the capital city. From 3,451 in September 2020 it has risen to 6,211 now \u00e2\u0080\u0094 80% higher.\n\nGoing by the current rate, Karnataka is expected to add at least 1.1 lakh cases this month, of which more than 80,000 may be in Bengaluru. That the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active cases \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than 1.3 lakh \u00e2\u0080\u0094 are at a higher level than the peak of 2020 is also concerning.\n\nWith the government suggesting the second wave would peak in the first week of May, experts anticipate a significant surge in deaths given that healthcare infrastructure is already showing signs of severe stress.\n\nDr Giridhara Babu, member, technical advisory committee (TAC), said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is already a shortage of beds especially for those needing critical care and with cases only rising, the number of deaths will certainly increase if the transmission chain isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t broken to reduce the stress on hospitals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnother expert said that the government lost focus late last year when cases began to dip despite projections of an impending second wave. Dr HM Prasanna, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), said beds are all filling up quickly and the shortage of medical oxygen is not helping critical care treatment.\n\nCompared to the more than 9,000 cases this month, the average of daily cases in March was just 1,475 \u00e2\u0080\u0094 517% less than April. Bengaluru too has reported a massive spike compared to March.\n\nThe average of daily cases had dipped continuously from November in Karnataka \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from 6,825 in October, it had dipped drastically to 1,927 in November and from there to 1,073 in December before hitting the low threedigit figure in January and February.\n\nDr V Ravi, nodal officer for genome sequencing of SARS-CoV2 and member, TAC, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is exactly what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been warning the government about. Unlike in 2020, we should have used the experience from last year and prepared in advance for this, but the government did not do that. It is now clear that there will be more deaths, many of which could have been prevented had there been proper planning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRavi and another expert TOI spoke with emphasised the need for effective home monitoring of patients to prevent further stress on the healthcare system.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOxygen saturation must be monitored every day and doctors need to call those in home isolation to ensure timely treatment and to save lives,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr Ravi said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt present, in the absence of this, patients are turning up very late to hospitals. This does two things: One, it makes it very difficult for doctors to save them, and two, such people will need critical care beds which could have been avoided,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added.\n\n"}

Besides, four other districts in Karnataka \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Bidar, Kalaburagi, Mysuru and Tumakuru \u00e2\u0080\u0094 have more than 3,000 active cases.As on Sunday (April 19), India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total active caseload had reached 19,29,329. Of these, five states \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Maharashtra , Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala \u00e2\u0080\u0094 together accounted for 63.1% of the cases. Karnataka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s share of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s active caseload is nearly 7%.Experts TOI spoke with say the only way to efficiently handle the increasing caseload is to categorise patients depending on the care they need and ensure sufficient beds.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf 15,000 cases are reported in Bengaluru every day and if say 90% are fit enough for home isolation, a minimum 1,500 patients will need to be hospitalised,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a doctor working on the BBMP expert\u00e2\u0080\u0099s committee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt the current rate, 1,500 beds are not falling vacant every day. It takes a minimum 4-5 days to discharge a Covid-infected patient from hospital. Saving lives will become much harder from here on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the doctor said.In the past 10 days, a majority of the fresh cases in Bengaluru were reported from BBMP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s south zone (15,811) which accounts for 19% of all cases, followed by west and east zones which account for 15% each.Karnataka\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Covid-19 technical advisory committee (TAC) has suggested that the government order select private hospitals to set up operations in hotels, which are stepdown hospitals equipped with oxygen beds.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis has been done in Mumbai and Delhi,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a TAC member. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNot every patient can be accommodated in hospitals henceforth and hence we need a system between hospitals and Covid Care Centres. These hotel-Covid care centres will have doctors and nurses and can be managed by the staff of private hospitals. They will be nothing but units of the hospitals in hotels,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the member said.The biggest challenge is to accommodate new patients in need of admission, said Dr BK Vijendra, chief health officer, BBMP. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA meeting with all elected representatives has been held,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dr Vijendra said, adding that the government will take appropriate measures.Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) said more restrictions are needed to break the chain of transmission. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEven if fresh cases come down by 10%, that will be a huge relief. Most private hospitals have limited scope to scale up. Instead, better utilisation of 10 medical colleges that have the infrastructure can be done and 8,000 beds can be created,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr HM Prasanna, president PHANA. He said private hospitals are already stretched to capacity."}

Of them, only 1,328 or 21.6% were vacant. Of the dedicated beds, 591 are ICU and 2,304 are HDU (high-dependency unit) beds. Only 2% (15) of the ICU beds and 9% of HDUs are vacant as of date. The data, part of BBMP \u00e2\u0080\u0099s Covid bed management database, is up to 12pm on Monday. It gets updated near real-time.According to the Private Hospitals\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and Nursing Homes\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Association, the difference between HDUs and ICUs is in terms of monitoring and type of ventilators. HDUs have one nurse for four patients; ICUs have one nurse for every two and, in some cases, for each patient. ICUs have invasive ventilators and a doctor round the clock. Both ICU and high-dependence units require oxygen.No less than 76% of the 5,560 beds listed for Covid care are in private facilities and the rest at two CCCs. The state government is trying to augment this by issuing diktats to private hospitals to allocate more beds, but with no great success.Citizen complaints have been pouring in, and many have reached out to volunteer groups seeking help in getting Covid beds. Ameen-e-Mudassar, part of a citizen volunteer group Emergency Response Team in Bengaluru, posted an emotional video on Monday urging people to stay indoors. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is absolute chaos. Several hospitals are discharging patients in ICUs as they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have oxygen while getting an ICU bed itself has become nearly impossible. We know of patients who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried 50-60 hospitals, there are queues outside hospitals, so please stay indoors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mudassar said.In many cases, hospitals cite existing occupancy for being unable to divert beds for Covid, and this is especially true for critical-care beds. An advocate seeking bed for a relative said private hospitals informed them that BBMP has taken over the beds and is dilly-dallying over allotment.Phana president Dr HM Prasanna admitted to problems with critical-care beds and said lack of home monitoring of cases is resulting in patients coming in at the last moment, requiring high-dependency units, if not ICUs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLast year, around 50% of patients in hospitals at any given time were not critical; this time, nearly 90% are critical.\u00e2\u0080\u009dOccupancy in general beds is also high. Of the 578 beds at two CCCs, only 14% are vacant; of the 2,666 general-category beds across facilities, 62% are occupied.Dr V Ravi, member, technical advisory committee, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rate at which cases are growing, the government must arrange for more beds. People should consult doctors before it is too late and to prevent need for ICU. They must regularly check for oxygen levels at home and consult doctors at the slightest change because deterioration occurs very quickly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d"}

Read More\n\nBy: R S Raveendhren\n\nCHENNAI: A section of people wants to free Hindu temples from government control. They want temples and their properties to be handed over to devotees to ensure better administration and management. These groups are also suggesting that the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) board under the Government of Tamil Nadu be disbanded.\n\nThere are three major grounds on which attacks are being launched against the HR&CE department. Its competency is under question in the light of mismanagement of temples, theft of idols and lack of protection to temple properties.\n\nIn January 2018, a response filed by the HR&CE department in the Madras high court stated that 1,204 sculptures belonging to 387 temples had been stolen since 1992. The laxity of the government in protecting the priceless idols, jewels, and sculptures of Hindu temples and its cavalier approach towards preservation of ancient heritage have sowed seeds of mistrust and shaken the confidence of the common man.\n\nTo understand the issues of the present, we need to delve into the past, looking into why the state control came into place.\n\nLegend has it that in the 7th century, Nandanar (one of the 63 Nayanmars), was denied entry into temples for being an outcast and Lord Sivalokanathar (Shiva) at the Tirupungur temple commanded Nandi (the bull) to move away from the gate to unobstruct Nandanar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view of the shrine. Discrimination while entering temples was a reality when the kings reigned, and the right to worship and access to temples remained elusive for a long time. Apart from this, there were complaints about mismanagement, misappropriation of temple funds, and failure to protect temple properties.\n\nMany believe that the British introduced the Madras Regulation VII of 1817, which brought temples under the control of the government as an agenda for colonisation and conversions. Temples in the south possessed massive land and wealth, with this regulation the British could monitor grants and endowments to them. In 1840, there was a directive to return temples to their trustees. This had something to do with Christian missionaries not liking the idea of managing Hindu temples.\n\nIn 1922, the Hindu Paripalanam Act was proposed by Ramraya Ningar, the king of Panagal, when he took charge as the chief minister of the Madras Presidency. He attempted to bring temples under the control of the government. In 1927, the HR&CE board was constituted and vested with the power to control and supervise administration of temples.\n\nFight against prejudices\n\nTamil Nadu may be a land with rich spiritual and cultural values, yet the right to worship at temples were secured only after the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention.\n\nFollowing the success of the temple entry movement by Periyar, A Vaidhyanatha Iyer headed the Madurai Temple Entry Movement in 1939 to facilitate the entry of the oppressed classes into Madurai Meenakshi temple. This was the time when the Temple Entry Authorisation and Indemnity Act of 1939 by C Rajagopalachari (the then CM of Madras Presidency) and Temple Entry Authorisation Act, 1947 by Omandoor P Ramasami Reddiar (first CM of Tamil Nadu) were passed. The legislation reflected the intent of the government to democratise temple worship and give all people access.\n\nPresent problem\n\nIn spite of damning allegations, the Tamil Nadu government chooses to stay silent on the issue. One of the campaigns against government control claims that the HR&CE Act, 1959 is ultra vires the Constitution and Hindu temples are selectively being subjected to state intervention. This is an attempt to mislead people. The Supreme Court had upheld the constitutional validity of the 1951 law which is its earlier version. Further, religious institutions and practices of Muslims, Christians and Sikhs are not immune to state intervention. It is a well-settled law that under Article 25 and Article 26 of the Constitution, the state has the right to regulate and manage the governance of temples.\n\nIt must be noted that the HR&CE department serves not just as a custodian of Hindu temples but also as a progressive transformative tool for society, managing eduational institutions, social welfare organisations and hospitals. The questions to be asked are: Can citizens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 groups seek any redemption of sovereign functions in their favour citing inefficient administration? Does this not tantamount to challenging the authority of a democratic state?\n\nThe state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention had unchained Hindu temples from communal hegemony that was enjoyed by dominant castes and economically strong sections. The right to worship and access to Hindu temples remained a socio-communal privilege. It was never available equally to all citizens.\n\nToday claims against state control are being made by whipping up religious sentiments. It buries the historical necessity of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention in the first place.\n\nWorking together for the future\n\nThe way forward is better accountability and efficiency on the part of the state. The provisions governing the eviction of encroachers and illegal occupants from temple land and properties should be amended by adopting a summary procedure. Present provisions do not come down heavily on squatters, which harms the interest of temples. Alienation of temple land and properties needs to be prohibited at the office of registration since the HR&CE department has completed the digitisation of land records of temples and mutts.\n\nThe government can invite citizens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 groups to forge and facilitate a government-citizen partnership (GCP) to restore and rehabilitate temples. It can welcome the devotees to sponsor various activities without compromising on its sovereign functions. That could go a long way in balancing sentiments of devout citizens without compromising on the social responsibilities of the government.\n\n(The author is an advocate at the Madras high court)\n\n"}

Prasad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family reached Chennai by bus from Dindigul where he was a daily wage labourer in a plywood-making unit.\n\nHowever, he was worried to see anxious guest workers like him slowly and steadily congregating at the railway station.\n\nFearful of a repeat of the exodus last year, guest workers are crowding railway stations and making inquiries on trains to their destinations. On Sunday, the Tamil Nadu government had put in place restrictions after Covid-19 cases breached the 10,000 mark for the first time. The restrictions have caused panic among hundreds of guest workers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have been adhering to the SOPs that are in place since last summer. We have advised employers to take care of the workforce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a senior IAS officer in the department of labour. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to see my family reach home (native village) before things turn unpleasant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Prasad who was worried about getting train tickets on time and a safe journey amid the Covid-19 surge due to the second wave of the pandemic.\n\nA group of youth from Odisha recalled their experience last summer and said they were \u00e2\u0080\u009cchased like dogs and treated badly\u00e2\u0080\u009d when they tried to escape the lockdown. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want that to happen this time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Vidhuth in not-so-fluent Tamil.

It has literally turned their home for the past three days. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are trying to book tatkal tickets for 10 of our family members, barring five of our children. Only four tickets were confirmed. Without a confirmed ticket, no one is let into the station.

He along with his brother and father were selling terracotta dolls in and around Tambaram to eke out a living. Though the situation was grim in their state, he said they had \u00e2\u0080\u009cno other choice\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nGopal, a porter in the railway station, said they had been seeing an unusual crowd in the past three days. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe can see hundreds of youngsters and women with children sitting with their belongings, packed and waiting restlessly to get tickets to their destination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young porter pointing to the long queue at the tatkal counter, while a Southern Railway official said the trains bound to north and northeastern states were going packed. They were allowing passengers with confirmed tickets into the station.\n\nA small section of guest workers from MSMEs in Coimbatore and garment sectors in Tirupur have begun leaving TN in the wake of the uncertain situation. The departure began a week ago and over the past two days, there has been a marginal increase in the number of guest workers leaving Coimbatore. However, the vast majority of guest workers in both cities have decided to wait and watch as they had returned only three months ago after almost six months in their hometowns.\n\nAs of now, there has been no sign of reverse migration from the central part of TN, particularly Karur, Trichy and Pudukottai districts that have a significant number of guest workers. A similar situation prevailed in Madurai and other southern districts.\n\n(With inputs from V Mayilvaganan, M K Ananth and K Sambath Kumar)\n\n"}

The Centre decided not to extend the scheme but introduce a \u00e2\u0080\u0098new dispensation to cover Covid-19 warriors\u00e2\u0080\u0099.

The duo urged the secretary to keep the insurance option open and make it user friendly.\n\n\"There is a growing shortage of doctors as they are overworked and stressed out. It is the responsibility of the government to keep their morale high with adequate care and open-minded support,\" they said.

He had visited Kochi towards the end of 2019, while a Master of Architecture student at the university.\n\nAccording to him, the Integrated Mangrove Fishery Research Centre project could address the issue of biodiversity loss in Kochi\u00e2\u0080\u0099s urban areas and to create a symbiotic relationship at the fringes where human and animal species meet. Spread over 5.2 hectares of land, the mangrove forest of Mangalavanam is home to 231 species.\n\nLacy suggested setting up the research centre next to a restored wetland area on the opposite side of the tracks to the old railway station. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis would mean that the old railway station could be preserved for future heritage and conservation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe centre is a multi-disciplinary biodiversity research centre which encourages interaction between people and wildlife through structures inhabited by nature,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he highlighted.\n\nWhen asked about the positive effect of a mangrove forest on the bird population of the town, Lacy said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThrough modelling species networks and understanding the interdependencies of bird species in the Mangalavanam, I discovered that the mangrove is a very important habitat structure for aquatic birds. Creating infrastructure that allows the mangroves to thrive will be important for the bird species but also to mitigate against flooding and other issues caused by climate change\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe site is an unusual occurrence in the highly urbanised metropolis of Kochi. Mangalavanam is a green lung, providing shelter and protection to over 231 different species within three different habitat types. Its densely forested area provide cooling to the busy streets that surround it. The high level of biodiversity means that the site is of special importance for migratory birds in an area where large developments are crowding out nesting spots. Locked in a bureaucratic land deadlock the site has been able to be peacefully inhabited by nature. Arguably the railway has been partly the reason for this as it has created a barrier which has deterred people from crossing the site,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lacy wrote in his thesis.\n\n"}

It is no longer appropriate for these two platforms to profit directly from local news while publishers increasingly struggle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he was quoted as saying.The report said that publishers from states like Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Mississippi, New Jersey, Indiana, Missouri, Maryland and Delaware have moved against the IT giants.Citing a recent report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the magazine said that nearly 30,000 newspaper jobs have disappeared between 1990 and 2016.\"Almost 20% of all newspapers have closed in the past 15 years, and countless others have become shells - or \u00e2\u0080\u0098ghosts\u00e2\u0080\u0099 - of themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the magazine said, quoting a recent report by the University of North Carolina.\u00e2\u0080\u009cNewspapers are essential to the functioning of our democracy and there is no replacement for a well-informed citizenry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d an attorney for the newspaper publishers said.Earlier this year, Australia had passed laws to forcing Google and Facebook to pay for news.The Australian government said that the law was passed to address the market imbalance between local news publishers and the two gateways to the internet.Australia's proposed law would be the first of its kind, but other governments also are pressuring Google, Facebook and other internet companies to pay news outlets and other publishers for material.In Europe, Google had to negotiate with French publishers after a court last year upheld an order saying such agreements were required by a 2019 European Union copyright directive.France is the first government to enforce the rules, but the decision suggests Google, Facebook and other companies will face similar requirements in other parts of the 27-nation trade bloc.Google and a group of French publishers have announced a framework agreement for the American company to negotiate licensing deals with individual publishers. The company has deals with outlets including the newspaper Le Monde and the weekly magazine l'Obs.Last year, Facebook announced it would pay US news organizations including The Wall Street Journal , The Washington Post and USA Today for headlines. No financial details were released.In Spain, Google shut down its news website after a 2014 law required it to pay publishers."}

Read More\n\nISLAMABAD: A banned Pakistani Islamist group called an end to violent nationwide anti-France protests on Tuesday after the government called a parliamentary vote on whether to expel the French ambassador and halted criminal cases against the group's members.\n\nPakistan outlawed the group Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) last week after its members blocked main highways, railways and access routes to major cities, assaulting police and burning public property.\n\nThe group has demanded that Pakistan expel the French ambassador in retaliation for the publication in France of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed.\n\nFour police officers were killed, 11 taken hostage and more than 800 wounded, many seriously, during the week-long clashes. The Islamists said three of their members were killed.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan warned his nation on Monday that Pakistan risked paying a price if it expelled the French envoy, as half the country's exports are sold to the European Union .\n\nNevertheless, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad said on Tuesday that the government had agreed \"after long negotiations with the TLP\" to put a resolution before parliament on whether to expel the ambassador. Parliament was specially convened so that the motion could be tabled.\n\nAll criminal cases registered against the TLP would also be withdrawn as a result of the agreement with the group, which had agreed in return to end its protests, the minister said.\n\nThe TLP responded by releasing an audio statement of its spokesman Shafiq Amini saying: \"It is requested to end protests wherever they are happening across the country.\"\n\nHowever there was no immediate sign that crowds were dispersing at the biggest protest, in the city of Lahore, where thousands of followers were gathered outside the group's headquarters.\n\nThe TLP has also demanded the release of its leader and hundreds of arrested staff, the removal of the ban and the dismissal of the interior minister.\n\nRelations between Paris and Islamabad became more strained after President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute late last year to a French teacher who was beheaded by a man of Chechen origin for showing cartoons depicting the Prophet in a lesson on free speech. Many Muslims consider such cartoons blasphemous. Macron maintains that free speech is a fundamental right in France.\n\nAt that time, protests broke out in Muslim world, including one led by the Islamists who shut the main highway to Islamabad until Khan's government agreed to endorse a boycott of French products and expel the envoy.\n\nFrance has already advised its citizens to temporarily leave Pakistan.\n\nAhmed Bilal Mehboob, a political analyst, told Reuters the government wanted the parliament to vote on the future of the French envoy, \"so they can say they have consulted with them and whatever step they take has a consensus behind it\".\n\nLast week's violence erupted after the government detained TLP leader Saad Hussain Rizvi on April 12 ahead of the planned anti-France campaign. The government started the negotiations after the Islamists freed the 11 police hostages on Monday.\n\nThe government's apparent acceptance of the militants' demands would be seen as a victory for the Islamists, said author and analyst Khaled Ahmed.\n\n\"The government's retreat from its stance and agreement indicate that none of the institutions can stand against them,\" he said.\n\n"}

The bank said the new currency, if it comes to pass, would be a new form of digital money for use by households and businesses and would exist alongside cash and bank deposits, rather than replacing them.\n\nDigital currencies are already being explored or even implemented in several other countries, with many proponents drawing inspiration from the success of Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies. However, digital currencies like the one being considered in the UK are different in a key sense to Bitcoin as they are issued by state authorities. One of the benefits of a digital currency would be as a backup to card payments if cash payments continue to drop in the years to come. By the end of this decade, only one in 10 payments in the UK are expected to be made with traditional paper money. Currently, only the Bahamas has such a currency, though China is trialing it in several cities. Sweden has indicated it could have its own digital currency by 2026, while the European Central Bank has indicated an e-euro might be created within four years.\n\nPromoting Monday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement, Sunak was brief. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBritcoin?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he tweeted.\n\n"}

I will be talking to Narendra Modi next Monday and we will do as much as we can virtually, and I look forward to doing it in person as and when the circumstances allow.\"The trip was meant to see the announcement of a post-Brexit enhanced trade partnership, together with various announcements on climate change and deepening defence and security ties in the Indo-Pacific region. Ficci had planned a maiden India-UK health summit with the presence of both PMs. Government officials told TOI all the planned announcements were now \"in limbo\".A business delegation was meant to accompany Johnson but this was never finalised owing to the deteriorating situation.Lord Karan Bilimoria, Confederation of British industry ( CBI ) president, said: \"Businesses are still hopeful that an enhanced trade deal with India is on the horizon \u00e2\u0080\u0094 an ambitious agreement that is forecasted to quadruple bilateral trade to \u00c2\u00a3100 billion by 2030.\"Jim Bligh, chair, CII UK India Business Forum, said: \"Business knows that the hard work of negotiating an enhanced trade partnership is going on regardless, and we look forward to that important document being signed.\"Others said it would have been bad optics to go ahead with the trip. \"Narendra Modi should be focused on getting oxygen tanks and PPE to hospitals rather than photo-ops with a foreign dignitary,\" one business leader said. \"Coming at the tail end of an election campaign was not a great idea even before the surge in Covid cases. The entire government apparatus has been focused on state elections,\" he said. \"Modi will visit Europe before the G7 and that would be a better time for them to meet.

Many felt such statues extol racism and are an affront to Black Britons. Others, including the prime minister, argued that removing them was erasing a piece of history.\n\n"}

They were denied entry after waiting for hours outside the gates.\n\nNavalny, who is Russian President Vladimir Putin 's most adamant opponent, has been on a hunger strike since March 31 to protest the prison officials' refusal to let his doctors visit him and provide adequate treatment for his back pains and numbness in his legs.\n\nRussia 's penitentiary service insists that Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs.\n\nThe prison service said in a statement Monday that Navalny's condition was deemed \"satisfactory,\" but another of his physicians, Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said over the weekend that test results provided by his family show Navalny has sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, as well as heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidney function.\n\nNavalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months convalescing from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin - an accusation Russian officials have rejected. His arrest triggered the biggest protests seen across Russia in recent years. In February, a Moscow court ordered him to serve 2 1/2 years in prison on a 2014 embezzlement conviction that the European Court of Human Rights deemed to be \"arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.\"\n\nIn response to Navalny's deteriorating health, his associates have called for a nationwide rally Wednesday, the same day that Putin is scheduled to deliver his annual state of the nation address.\n\nRussian authorities, meanwhile, have escalated their crackdown on Navalny's allies and supporters, with the Moscow prosecutor's office asking a court to brand Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his network of regional offices as extremist organizations.\n\nHuman rights activists say such a move would paralyze their activities and expose their members and donors to prison sentences of up to 10 years.\n\n"}

Diplomats from the world powers have been shuttling between the Iranian delegation and an American one, which is also in Vienna but not talking directly with the Iranian side.\n\nTwo expert groups have been brainstorming solutions to the two major issues: The rollback of American sanctions on one hand, and Iran's return to compliance on the other.\n\nNow, said Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov, \"we can note with satisfaction that the negotiations (are) entering the drafting stage.\"\n\n\"Practical solutions are still far away, but we have moved from general words to agreeing on specific steps towards the goal,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nFrom the perception of the E3, the three western European countries involved in the talks, there is \"progress and the will to move forward\" in Vienna, German Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Adebahr said.\n\n\"Overall, we may be, and hopefully are on a path of rapprochement,\" she told reporters in Berlin. \"But there are still many, many open questions.\"\n\nAlready on Saturday, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said that Tehran had proposed draft agreements that could be a basis for negotiations.\n\n\"We think that the talks have reached a stage where parties are able to begin to work on a joint draft,\" Araghchi told Iranian state television. \"It seems that a new understanding is taking shape, and now there is agreement over final goals.\"\n\n\"The path is better known, but it will not be easy path,\" Araghchi added. \"It does not mean that differences of views have come to the end.\"\n\nBiden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told Fox News Sunday that the Vienna talks had been \"constructive,\" but he wouldn't give specific details on the proposals.\n\n\"What I will say is that the United States is not going to lift sanctions unless we have clarity and confidence that Iran will fully return to compliance with its obligations under the deal,\" he said.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh was quoted by the country's official IRNA news agency Monday as saying that there was \"some progress in the talks, but it doesn't mean the resolution of differences.\"\n\n\"We think the US administration knows better than anyone that Iran's actions are within the framework of the nuclear deal and they will be halted when the US lifts sanctions and we can verify that,\" he said.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something it insists it doesn't want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed.\n\nChallenges also remain outside of the negotiations.\n\nAn attack suspected to have been carried out by Israel recently struck Iran's Natanz nuclear site, causing an unknown amount of damage. Tehran retaliated by beginning to enrich a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, its highest level ever. Inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency also could be disrupted without an agreement.\n\nThe IAEA , the UN's nuclear watchdog, has also been trying for months to get what it considers a credible explanation from Iran about the discovery of uranium particles at three former undeclared sites in the country.\n\nIn March, Iran had agreed to host IAEA technical experts for talks on the issue, but instead those discussions started Monday in Vienna, since the Iranian experts were already on hand for the ongoing JCPOA negotiations, the IAEA said.\n\nIAEA Director General Rafael Grossi has been pushing Iran for answers on the three sites where inspections had revealed traces of uranium of human-made origin, suggesting they were once connected to Iran's nuclear program.\n\nAfter Iran agreed to have its technical experts talk with those at the IAEA, Grossi said he hoped to \"come to some satisfactory outcome\" by the next IAEA board meeting in June.\n\n"}

A year later, he was also one of the main signatories of the Damascus-Beirut Declaration, calling for Syria to recognize Lebanon's independence. That declaration was one of the main reasons for his arrest and sentencing to three years in prison in 2006.Kilo was a strong supporter of protests that erupted against Assad's government in 2011 and was among leading figures who worked to develop a political framework for the opposition movement. The protests descended into civil war.Burhan Ghalioun, a Syrian-French professor of sociology and a prominent opposition member, called Kilo a \"historical figure.\"\"It's a big loss for the democratic and freedoms movement in Syria but also the Arab world. He was one of the most important pillars of the Syrian opposition,\" he said.\"He is a historical opposition figure, an important intellectual, thinker,\" Ghalioun added. He withstood all the pressure and resisted oppression all along.\"Kilo, a Christian, is survived by his wife, Wadia, his daughter Shadia and two sons. All of them live in France."}

AP Photo\n\nCAIRO: A passenger train derailed Sunday north of Cairo , killing at least 11 people, Egyptian authorities said. It was the latest of several rail accidents to hit the country in recent years.\n\nFour train wagons ran off the railway at the city of Banha in Qalyubia province, just outside Cairo, the railway authority said in a statement. Videos on social media showed wagons overturned and passengers escaping to safety along the railway.\n\nThe train was travelling to the Nile Delta city of Mansoura from the Egyptian capital, the statement said.\n\nThe Health Ministry said in a statement that besides the dead, at least 98 people were injured, with most of them suffering from broken bones, cuts and bruises.\n\nAt least 60 ambulances were sent to the scene and the injured were taken to nearby hospitals, the ministry added.\n\nSalvage teams could be seen searching for survivors and removing the derailed wagons. It was not immediately clear what caused the train to derail. Prosecutors said they were investigating the causes of the crash.\n\nThe state-run Ahram daily reported that authorities have detained at least 10 railway officials, including the train driver and his assistant, pending an investigation into the crash.\n\nAt Banha University hospital, people lined up to donate blood for the crash victims. Families were also present looking for loved ones who had been travelling on the train.\n\n\"We were surprised by the strain speeding up,\" said Tarek Gomaa, one of the injured. \"We found ourselves on top of each other.\"\n\nSunday's train accident came three weeks after two passenger trains collided in the province of Sohag, killing at least 18 people and injuring 200 others, including children.\n\nProsecutors said they found that gross negligence by railway employees was behind the deadly March 25 crash, which caused public outcry across the country.\n\nTrain wrecks and mishaps are common in Egypt , where the railway system has a history of badly maintained equipment and mismanagement. The government says it has launched a broad renovation and modernization initiative. President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said in March 2018 that the government needs about 250 billion Egyptian pounds, or $14.1 billion, to overhaul the run-down rail system.\n\nHundreds of train accidents are reported every year. In February 2019 an unmanned locomotive slammed into a barrier inside Cairo's main Ramses railway station, causing a huge explosion and a fire that killed at least 25 people. That crash prompted the then-transportation minister to resign.\n\nIn August 2017, two passenger trains collided just outside the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, killing 43 people. In 2016, at least 51 people were killed when two commuter trains collided near Cairo.\n\nEgypt's deadliest train crash was in 2002, when over 300 people were killed after a fire broke out in an overnight train traveling from Cairo to southern Egypt.\n\n"}

It was not known why the president would have visited the frontlines in northern Chad or participated in ongoing clashes with the rebels who opposed his rule.\n\nDeby, a former army commander-in-chief, first came to power in 1990 when his rebel forces overthrew then-President Hissene Habre, who was later convicted of human rights abuses at an international tribunal in Senegal.\n\nOver the years Deby had survived numerous armed rebellions and managed to stay in power until this latest insurgency led by a group calling itself the Front for Change and Concord in Chad.\n\nThe rebels are believed to have armed and trained in neighboring Libya before crossing into northern Chad on April 11. Their arrival came on the same day that Chad's president sought a sixth term on election day, which several top opposition candidates boycotted.\n\nDeby was a major French ally in the fight against Islamic extremism in Africa , hosting the base for the French military Operation Barkhane and supplying critical troops to the peacekeeping effort in northern Mali.\n\nDeby's son, Mahamat, has served as a top commander for Chadian forces taking part in that effort.\n\n"}

Hirofumi Yoshimura's decision to request a third state of emergency comes two weeks after a month of alert measures began in the prefecture and just 50 days after an earlier toothless state of emergency ended.The ongoing alert, which started on April 5 in Osaka and has since been expanded to 10 areas including Tokyo , allows prefectural leaders to issue binding orders for bars and restaurants to operate shorter hours in exchange for compensation, with penalties for violators.A new state of emergency, under a law toughened in February, would allow authorities to issue binding orders for business owners to close or shorten service hours. Measures for the general public, including mask wearing and staying at home, would remain non-mandatory requests.Nationwide, Japan has recorded 537,317 cases including 9,671 deaths as of Monday - results that are good by world standards but worse than in some other Asian countries - without any enforced lockdowns. But people are becoming impatient and less cooperative in response to requests.Osaka is expected to close theme parks, shopping malls and other commercial facilities to drastically reduce public activity for a few weeks.Requests from local leaders for anti-virus measures highlight delays by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga 's government, which has already been criticized for being slow because of its reluctance to further hurt the pandemic-hit economy. Suga met with key ministers on Tuesday to discuss measures for Osaka.Osaka's neighboring Hyogo prefecture and Tokyo are expected to follow, adding to uncertainty about Japan's plans to host the Olympics in three months. Less than 1% of the population has been vaccinated.In Tokyo, partial alert measures began last week amid a rapid upsurge in infections fueled by a new variant first detected in Britain. Gov. Yuriko Koike said she is considering seeking a state of emergency so she can take tougher measures.Tokyo's previous emergency ended on March 21 but its daily cases climbed to 711 on Tuesday.Osaka, which had 1,153 new cases Tuesday, has a dire shortage of hospital beds and health workers, Yoshimura said.Experts said Osaka's medical systems have been overextended and about 70 nurses are being dispatched from around the country to help.Officials are concerned that the overburdened medical system could further delay Japan's slow-moving vaccination program.Japan's inoculation campaign lags behind many countries, with imported vaccines in short supply while its attempts to develop its own vaccines are still in the early stages.Health minister Norihisa Tamura said Tuesday that officials are considering mobilizing dentists to help in the immunization campaign. The government has already revised a law to allow temporary employment of retired nurses."}

But on March 24 last year, Covid-19 left Tokyo 2020 organisers and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) with no choice but to postpone the Games to 2021.It's been a little over a year since that decision came down as a hammer for the athletes, followed by the lockdown. The rustiness from months of no practice blunted the edge players had developed over a grind of four years. The Indian hockey teams likewise had been peaking, but were forced to bide their time surrounded by walls.Training for hockey players resumed around June last year, but January 2021 brought the brightest news. The women's team got the green signal to board the flight to Argentina , which followed an exposure trip to Germany .\"We got to play [after the pandemic-forced break] ...It was special, especially Argentina and Germany who are world No. 2 and 3,\" said the women's team captain, Rani, during an interaction with Timesofindia.com.India, ranked 9th currently, had defeated USA in a dramatic second match of their Olympic qualifier last year. It's only the first time that a women's hockey team from India has qualified for the Olympics in two successive editions of the Games, with the earlier and only appearance before 2016 being the 1980 Moscow Olympics.The team looked better prepared to erase the nightmarish last-place finish at Rio 2016. But the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics was a body blow.\"We have left that line of thought behind,\" insisted Rani when quizzed about postponement of the Games last year. \"We are out of that zone now, as it was something we could do nothing about. I know a year back we were peaking well, we were hoping for a medal. That belief is still there because we built our mindset accordingly, even though we were upset.\"A year's gap can have drastic effects on a player and a team's form, which Rani admitted. But speaking on behalf of her team, the skipper said they would do all it takes to make their appearance in Tokyo much more than just participation.\"It's difficult for an athlete to push himself or herself for another year at the same level. But definitely we have the belief that we don't want to just participate in the Olympics, rather we have to do something [big].\"The resumption of play at a competitive level, though, didn't yield the results the team would have expected. It remained winless across seven practice games in Argentina, and lost all four matches in Germany.But Rani threw her weight behind the team for standing tall against two top teams.\"Overall, these (Argentina and Germany) were good tours. I know everybody talks about results [but] we were playing after one year. During lockdown we could just work on fitness...So we first had to analyse [in a match situation] where we are fitness-wise, how much more we need to work on it, both practically and technically,\" said Rani.Compared to the first half of the last decade, things have changed drastically over the last 5-6 years in terms of how women's hockey is looked at and taken care of in India.The team has been getting more exposure in terms of tours, which helped them break into the top-10 for the first time. Still, the larger part of their competitive games are against Asian nations, who remain a few steps away from the top bracket in women's hockey.\"It was not easy playing the world No. 2 and 3 teams, who we hadn't played against in the last few years. So we didn't have much idea what style of play they would bring to the pitch, as we have mostly been playing Asian teams,\" said Rani.\"These are the teams - Argentina, Germany, Holland and so on - who when we play against, we come to know whether we were working on the right track or not and how much more we need to work.\"We have to stay a step ahead of the top teams. Both these teams [Argentina and Germany] mostly play the semis of Olympics and World Cups. We don't have that experience. So they know how to handle those moments [pressure situations].\"Having said that, Rani stressed on the fact that the Indian team has risen to a level where it believes that the European and American teams are very much beatable.\"When we look at our team, then there is not a very big difference between us and those [top] teams. Earlier the gap between us and the European nations seemed bigger; but now when we play them, that difference seems smaller.\"If we continuously work on the finer details, we can beat them; they are not unbeatable,\" Rani told TimesofIndia.com.The women's team is scheduled to reassemble for a national camp. If the Covid graph permits, the team is expected to travel to Netherlands in May for another exposure tour in the run-up to the rescheduled Olympics in July-August."}

In India on the PGTI I had some good results including Tied-3rd at Gujarat and Tied-4th at Tata Steel Tour Championships in December. But on European Tour things did not come together,\" Chawrasia said.\n\n\"Though I was in the fray at halfway stage, the third round pulled me back, but I was happy to fight back on the final nine on the final day.\"\n\nChawrasia's previous Top-20 in Europe was T-18 in Made in Denmark in May 2019.\n\n\"I am playing in Spain next couple of weeks and I have always loved Spain and I have good friends.

(Photo by Luke Walker/Getty Images)\n\nNEW ORLEANS: India's Arjun Atwal plans to produce some \"awesome golf\" as he partners Thai star Kiradech Aphibarnrat in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans at TPC Louisiana beginning on Thursday.\n\nThe 48-year-old Atwal feels the duo has the ability to surprise top teams with their golf at the $7.4 million PGA TOUR showpiece.\n\nThe event sees 80 two-man teams slugging it out under a different format, with Four-Ball being used in the first and third rounds and Foursomes (alternate shot) in the second and final rounds.\n\nJon Rahm and Ryan Palmer will defend the title they won in 2019. The event was not held last year due to COVID-19. Other leading teams will be Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay, Matt Wolff and Collin Morikawa, Justin Rose and Henrik Stenson, Marc Leishman and Cameron Smith, Tony Finau and Cameron Champ and Sungjae Im and Byeong Hun An.\n\nAtwal has always been impressed by Kiradech, who was in the Asian team at EurAsia Cup, which he captained. This time around it was Kiradech who picked Atwal.\n\nBoth are former Asian No. 1s and have won a combined seven European Tour victories between them.\n\n\"There's nothing to not like about Kiradech. He's such a cool guy, and he's laid back just like me. We recently played a few rounds together and I realised how similar his game is to mine, at least during my peak,\" Atwal said.\n\n\"I know he's struggled a little bit over the last few weeks but I think he's found his form and I think you'll be seeing some awesome golf from us.\"\n\nKiradech has failed to find his best form for nearly two years now, missing six cuts in 10 starts in the current season which have left him in danger of losing his PGA TOUR card. He hopes that partnering one of Asia's golf legends will provide the missing spark.\n\n\"The reason why I picked Arjun is because he's one of the best Asian players ever. He's won on the Asian Tour, European Tour and PGA TOUR and there's no doubt in my mind why I picked him.\n\n\"He's also such a nice guy, a very positive guy and I'm looking forward to playing alongside him. We're very comfortable with each other and I'm sure we're going to have a lot of fun,\" said the 31-year-old Thai.\n\nBoth Asian stars are competing for the first time in the tournament under this new team format, although Kiradech will lean on his more experienced partner who finished fifth at TPC Louisiana in 2005 when it was played as an individual strokeplay event.\n\n\"I've had some success on this golf course. I was leading and had a mishap in the third round but I like the course and I'm loving it that I get to play with Kiradech,\" said Atwal.\n\n\"I asked Kiradech if he was interested in partnering and he said 'yes' as he thinks I'm good luck. Our style is pretty similar ... he can hit a fade at will and I can hit a draw at will. So that works for us and we will strategize.\n\n\"Our short game is pretty similar too but his is actually fantastic. I think we will have a great week. One thing I know for sure is that we'll have a lot of fun playing together.\"\n\nKiradech thinks a change to the team format will do him wonders as he seeks to improve on his current 183rd ranking on the FedExCup points list.\n\nThe Top-125 at the end of the Regular Season in August keep their cards and also qualify for the lucrative FedExCup Playoffs.\n\n\"I just need someone to trust in me and believe in me and the right role model is Arjun. It'll be a pleasure to play with him and I want to thank him for spending time with me,\" Kiradech said.\n\n\"I've not set a target that we need to do well or need to win as we just want to enjoy ourselves. I'm sure this week will be one of the best times in my golf career.\"\n\n"}

Neither was hurt and stewards declared it a racing incident.Russell climbed out and confronted Bottas, still sitting in his wrecked car, and asked him whether he had wanted to kill them both.He also accused Finn of breaking a 'gentleman's agreement' with a dangerous tactical move and suggested Bottas had been harder with him because Russell, a Mercedes-managed driver, might be in the frame to take his seat.\"Having had time to reflect on what happened afterwards, I know I should have handled the whole situation better,\" said Russell.\"Emotions can run high in the heat of the moment and yesterday mine got the better of me. I apologise to Valtteri, to my team and to anyone who felt let down by my actions.

On Sunday, Hamilton was on pole his record-extending 99th and finished runner-up with a bonus point for fastest lap.\n\nThe bare figures mask the fact that Bahrain was a missed opportunity for Verstappen, whose car was faster all weekend, while in Italy Hamilton made a rare mistake that could have punished him hard.\n\nHamilton was ninth and a lap down when the race was stopped halfway through, due to a high-speed collision between team mate Valtteri Bottas and Mercedes protege George Russell in the Williams.\n\nThe restart cancelled out the deficit and put him in a position to launch a strong recovery drive on a drying track after a wet start.\n\n\"I think, without doubt, getting back to second and getting these points will be very valuable through the season.

We ended up on pole but if Max puts in a clean lap we're probably two and a half tenths behind, maybe three,\" said Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff .\n\n\"That is simply what the pecking order is at the moment... according to the data we are still not having a car and power unit that can match the Red Bull Honda.\"\n\nDespite Mercedes playing up Red Bull's speed, Horner observed that the champions were still very quick and also gentler on the tyres.\n\nThey have also set the fastest lap in both races, with Bottas quickest in Bahrain.\n\n\"You've only got to look at the end of the stints on the intermediate and their pace at the end of the race. Lewis got the fastest lap by a decent margin,\" said Horner.\n\n\"Their pace is very, very strong and we're going to have to go some to keep them under pressure.\"\n\n"}

Joining the nation in welcoming the decision were Bollywood stars from Kareena Kapoor Khan to Alia Bhatt, Ananya Panday to Malaika Arora , Huma Qureshi, Mira Kapoor, and others. The stars took to their respective social media handles to laud the decision and spread awareness.While people wait to get their vaccine shots, Priyanka Chopra shared her concerns about the rising number of cases in India. Priyanka took to her twitter handle to pen a lengthy note and shared some tips to keep the virus at bay. \"The COVID-19 situation in India is grave. I'm seeing images and stories coming in from different parts of the country that are so scary...the situation is out of control and our medical fraternity is at a breaking point,\" she said while also appealing to fans to follow COVID norms.Kangana Ranaut seemed to have had something entirely different to say.

Word got out that the makers decided to take the high road and not take undue advantage of the situation Rhea was in for commercial benefits and promotion of the film. Hence, the team decided to include Rhea in the promotions only when she was comfortable.In some filmy news of the day, buzz around town states that Sanjay Leela Bhansali may just be ready to take 'Inshallah' off the back burner and revive the project with Alia Bhatt and Hrithik Roshan in lead roles. Rumour has it that SLB is keen to get the film rolling before 'Baiju Bawra' because it has a more modern and contemporary take on love. This lovestory will see the young Alia fall for a much older guy played by Hrithik."}

Our marriage was peaceful and happy until his mother moved in with us last year during the pandemic. She took over our kitchen and started making my husband's meals. She knew I followed a diet, so she cooked for herself and my husband, keeping me out of their mealtimes. Every time I and my husband had an argument over something, she would also make him sleep with her. Somewhere down the months, we both stopped talking and my husband still nudges me that I should try harder. I can't deal with this woman anymore and it will break my marriage. Please helpHi, thank you for writing to us.From what you have shared, I can understand that you are getting increasingly frustrated and exhausted, which is a very valid reaction to the situation you have described. It is very common that when any third person, be it a parent, starts living with two people in a marriage, the partners' space and equation get troublesome. In short, it is chaos in paradise.I can understand how that is creating issues between you and your husband as you are not getting one-on-one time with your husband which is especially crucial for any relationship.But one thing that needs to be given some importance too is that it seems as if your mother-in-law is wanting to spend some time with \"her son\" and not \"Your husband\". Furthermore, this can be a possibility that maybe even she is having a hard time adjusting to the new environment which is why she is taking those extreme measures and wants to be with someone or something that is familiar to her, like her son.In such a situation, communication can work wonders. It is advised for you to have a clear and calm conversation alone with your mother-in-law about how and what behaviour of her's is affecting you. It needs to be told that her actions are causing a distance between you and your husband, which you are not okay with.Also, an honest calm conversation needs to happen between you and your husband to inform him how all of this is affecting you and your relationship and that he also needs to understand it. He, too, needs to have certain boundaries.Lastly, I would request you to try and change your perspective a little here and understand that there is a possibility that no one is meaning anyone's harm here. And it is a great possibility that maybe everyone in the home is going through their own struggles which can be understood and taken care of with open and honest communication.I hope this helps.

Even Sushmita Sen and Priyanka Chopra Jonas have also spoken about how their respective partners Rohman Shawl and Nick Jonas slid into their DMs on Instagram and Twitter. \u2018Social media romances\u2019 are becoming increasingly common, despite the proliferation of dating apps online. Last year, a report by Compare The Market \u2013 a UK-based research company \u2013 showed that 20 per cent of respondents had found love on social media, and by March 2021, the number spiked to 35 per cent. Psychologist Dr Shaileja Nair \u2013 who is researching the topic \u2013 says the trend is similar in India. She explains why youngsters are preferring Instagram, Twitter and Facebook to dating sites and says, \u201cDating sites often fail to tell the entire story of a user. It is easy to make fake profiles, and such sites are also replete with dating frauds. There\u2019s also an element of secrecy involved that some may not like. Meanwhile, on social media, it is easy to screen through the profile of the person, find out what their likes are, as well as get a glimpse of their personality.\u201dRelationship counsellor Mohit Gupta shares, \u201cDating apps offer limited matches and there are certain restrictions on swipes. In comparison, social media is much more diverse, relaxed and gives potential users plenty of options to get to know one another- through posts, opinions reshares and even video chats. There are several communities too, like meme lovers, book lovers and more.\"He adds, \u201cWith dating apps and sites putting several features behind a paywall, people would rather turn to social media to find a partner, than shell out extra money. For example, on Instagram, one can use relevant hashtags for dating purposes and start a conversation with anyone, in any part of the world. On dating apps, you can only match with people around the world if you have paid for the feature.\u201d\u201cWe are spending more time on social media and dating sites in the lockdown and one\u2019s page is a glimpse of what that person is like in reality,\u201d says data analyst and relationship expert Sujoy Bhattacharya. Most romances start with one \u2018sliding into the DMs\u2019 of their social media crush, and using their common likes, dislikes and choice in memes, as ice-breakers. However, Sujoy warns, \u201cSliding into one\u2019s DMs could also come across as borderline stalking.\u201d One needs to know how to initiate a conversation and back off if the other person isn\u2019t interested.\u201cUnderstand that finding love on social media is a slower process than on dating apps,\u201d says Sujoy, adding, \u201cThe success rate is higher among people who have met each other before, like those reuniting through DMing after college, rather than random strangers.\u201dMBA student from Pune, Danish Khan, who met his wife on Instagram, shares, \u201cSliding into someone\u2019s DMs takes skills. You cannot be pushy. You need to have patience and good communication skills. Unlike on dating apps, on social media, one\u2019s main goal isn\u2019t to \u2018find love\u2019. So, it\u2019s better to talk about common interests and get to know each other, before taking things ahead. On dating apps, this conversation part is often rushed.\u201d\u201cWhile the prospect of finding your future soulmate on Instagram or Twitter sounds serendipitous, you shouldn't get in the habit of treating social media like a dating site,\u201d feels dating expert Shravani Sonawane, adding, \u201cUse your judgement and discretion before meeting the person IRL. It is better to communicate more to find out more about the person, and to always be vigilant.\u201dSailesh Kamat, who has dated people he's met on dating sites as well as social media, shares, \u201cIt's better to connect with people you know on social media. However, if you do send or get a message from a stranger, it's better to do your homework before taking things ahead. Over the years, social media sites have introduced several safety measures including restricted information, private accounts and reporting and flagging off other accounts and content - in case someone feels the need to use them, go ahead and be safe.\u201dShravani suggests, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to accept someone\u2019s friend request immediately. Wait for some time and when the trust builds, you should allow the person in your social media life.\u201d"}

In fact, a recent report revealed that a lot of 0 to 19-year-olds are getting admitted to the hospital due to COVID . So those of you who have kids at home, what should you do?Dr Arun Shah, senior pediatrician, MD DCH FRCP FIMSA FIAP FNNF FIAMS, President IAP Bihar 2018 explains, \u201c2021, unlike 2020 is different for kids. In 2020, most children were asymptomatic and were rarely affected. But due to the high infectivity and simultaneous 3-4 strains in the country, a lot of children are getting infected. The virus has a higher attaching capability and children are also reporting symptoms. I get multiple calls from parents throughout the day about their child testing positive.\u201d The virus is incidentally also presenting different behaviour and clinical presentation in some. Some of the signs seen in kids are high fever, diarrhoea, pain in the abdomen, fatigue, weakness. \u201cMost shocking is that sometimes it\u2019s clinically proven to be COVID but the RT-PCR report shows a negative report.\u201dDr. Preetha Joshi, Consultant, Neonatal, Pediatric and Cardiac Intensivist, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital (KDAH) explains, \u201cIf there is a fear of exposure, showcasing any symptoms like cough or cold or in case someone has tested positive, then parents should immediately isolate themselves and avoid contact with the child - provided a caretaker is available. If not and all are asymptomatic, then the child can be looked after with everyone masking and following hand hygiene properly.\u201dDr Preetha adds, \u201cAt present, if a child develops fever and other members are have no symptoms then one has to assume the child is positive and the parents or family members are asymptomatic because, in present times, it is the most prevalent infection.Start treating the child for fever with antiviratic like crocin or paracetamol and if the fever continues for more than two days then getting the child tested is a must. Children can be tested using the RTPCR (Nasal swab) test.\u201dThe most visible symptoms at the moment are cold and cough, rare symptoms are abdominal pain or loose motions. Follow symptomatic treatment, as children don\u2019t develop very severe disease, it is manageable. For loose motions follow hydration, for fever, cold and cough give them routine medicationsThere can be two types of critical signs, according to Dr Preetha- Child is COVID positive because the family has tested positive \u2013 this is called acute COVID \u2013 the child has got COVID freshly. Usually, children develop cough and cold, however, children with co-morbidities develop little more illness with issues like breathlessness. If this happens then hospitalization is required- Illness visible four weeks after a child has contracted COVID or if the family was tested positive for COVID. This is called Kawasaki like syndrome, which presents with rash, fever, redness of eyes, tongue, hands and feet. Keep monitoring the child\u2019s health for a minimum a month as this syndrome is dangerous and if at all the child develops Kawasaki like syndrome symptoms, immediately seek medical help as most of these children need hospitalisation.Have a well-balanced diet with vitamins and minerals which are present in fruits and vegetables.Plenty of hydration is recommendedAs going out is not an option at the moment, kids should be engaged with indoor activities like yoga or mild exercises. Parents can seek help from online videos to help their child. The need is to encourage the child to have a well-balanced routine to keep them mentally and physically fit."}

States will also be separately allowed to procure more doses from manufacturers directly, which may be especially helpful to states which have been amongst the worst-affected ones by the second wave of coronavirus.\n\nYounger populations, particularly those below the age of 50 are more susceptible to complications and hospitalization risk associated with COVID-19 right now.

Being the first fencer from India to qualify for the Olympics, Bhavani says that she is happy to have set an example for many girls to dream big. Talking to us from Italy, where she has been undergoing training, Bhavani says, \u201cI am happy and proud to be an inspiration to many girls. I am working very hard and I want to put up my best performance. And yes, I need a lot of support and blessings coming my way from India.\u201dBut the journey so far hasn\u2019t been an easy one, she says. From pursuing a niche sport to handling funding issues, her journey comes across as one of grit and determination. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to quit the sport just because I didn\u2019t have anyone to look up to. I just wanted to try my best and achieve my dream. And that kept me motivated. Also, I realised that everyone was concerned about me. So, I was ready to work hard and my family was very supportive,\u201dsays Bhavani, who will compete in the women\u2019s individual sabre event in Tokyo.Looking back at her early days in fencing, her mother, CA Ramani, says, \u201cIn 2004, while she was in class VI in Muruga Dhanushkodi Girls\u2019 Higher Secondary School in Chennai, CM Jayalalithaa amma introduced five games at school level.Bhavani registered her name for two events \u2014 squash and fencing. But since both selectionshappened on the same day, she had to choose one and she picked fencing. And in 2005, she won her first national gold medal in the sub-junior category. Since then, she would go for all competitions and win medals in every category she competed. And in 2007, she started going for international events.\u201dHowever, it was a hard lesson that she learnt at her first international tourney in Turkey in 2007. She was given a black card for being late by a few minutes and she couldn\u2019t take part in the event. She says, \u201cYes, that taught me the importance of time.Bhavani adds, \u201cAfter that I would always ensure that I book the hotel closer to the venue and reach there on time. That incident taught me to finish every task on time.\u201dThe youngster, who has several firsts to her credit, including being the first Indian to win a gold medal at the senior Commonwealth Fencing Championship 2018, continues, \u201cMy pursuit to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics started five years ago. I wanted to compete in the Rio Olympics. But I didn\u2019t make the cut. The very next day after the Rio qualification event, I started preparing for the Tokyo Games. Now, here I am, qualified for the Tokyo Olympics and preparing for the big event!\u201dHer mother says there were times when Bhavani almost had to give up the sport because of lack of funds. \u201cIt was really tough to manage the finances. We had to shell out for everything on our own. Her interest in the sport alone made me spend on it. But I was keen that she does well in studies, too. She completed her MBA from Anna University. There were objections \u2014 for spending time and money on a sport which was not at all known to many here. But she kept winning events and I knew it wasn\u2019t going to go waste,\u201d she says, adding, \u201cAt one point, in 2015, when Bhavani was in the US, I asked her to leave everything behind and return to India. We were spending about `2.5 lakh a month. Finally, I decided to meet the CM and she helped us out. Using that money, Bhavani went for a competition in Europe and won an individual bronze. Soon after the event, CM announced a prize money of `2 lakh for her. That also helped us. Later, she was included in the elite scheme scholarship list of the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu. She also got support from a foundation that supports young and emerging sportspersons. That made her continue pursuing the sport.\u201dDuring the lockdown, Bhavani spent her time practising on the terrace. \u201cLast year, when the competition in Belgium was cancelled due to COVID-19, she immediately flew down to Chennai. She self-quarantined for 10 days at home. Then, she slowly started her training,\u201d recalls Ramani, \u201cShe would practise on the terrace every day. That continued for four months. It was only when the lockdown was relaxed that she could go to the gym. In October, she went back to Italy. But the very next month, I fell ill and was admitted to the ICU. She almost decided to come back, leaving behind her Olympics dreams. But I didn\u2019t let her do that. I insisted she continue training in Italy. She would call every day at least 10 times to check on me. She was scared because it was only a year ago that she lost her father.\u201dRamani reveals her one wish is that Bhavani comes back with an Olympic medal. \u201cShe\u2019s got six hours of training and you can imagine how you would feel at the end of it. I am constantly worried, thinking about what she eats and all that. She would pick up her phone just to make a one-minute call to me every night to tell me that she is doing fine. The next 90-something days are very crucial for her. She has put in so much effort to come this far. There were times when she had stayed overnight at airports to save on an extra day\u2019s accommodation. I am really hoping that she\u2019ll be back with a medal. That\u2019s my prayer,\u201d she signs off on a hopeful note."}

Apart from his professional journey, Kabir also opens up about his personal life, his tumultuous relationships, his setbacks in life and exciting times.The book's cover was officially launched earlier by Kabir and Salman Khan on April 8. Interestingly, the cover photo was taken by Terry O\u2019Neil, Elton John\u2019s photographer, way back in the early 1970s.Talking about the feedback that he's been getting about the book, Kabir said, \"I have been getting wonderful feedback and it is very gratifying... But I did notice that in the media they tend to focus a lot on the Parveen Babi and Protima Bedi angles because that's where they figured familiar names and they would talk about it. And I felt that yes that's true, I have written about it, but they are just two chapters in my book. I have many chapters and many stories in my book.\"During the official book launch with the author, Priyanka Chopra Jonas revealed that her mother Madhu Chopra is a huge fan of Kabir Bedi. \"My mom is the hugest Kabir Bedi fan since she was 19 years old. When I signed-up 'Hero' she wasn't excited about the fact that I signed my first film with Sunny Deol, Anil Sharma and others. But she was most excited about the fact that I was working with you!,\" she told Bedi.Praising the book, Priyanka said, \"You have had such an incredibly prolific life. I agree with the book's title that these are stories you must tell! You have experienced so much of life- both professional and personal; there is so much that we can learn through it. You really paved the way for people like me (from Bollywood to Hollywood).\"The book launch was followed by an interesting conversation between the two actors, wherein Kabir shared a series of fascinating anecdotes from his book and life. Reminiscing about how he got his roles in Hollywood, Kabir shared, \"You are kind of right-- I was probably the first Bollywood actor who made a career in Hollywood... By that time, I had stardom in Europe behind me. But when I came to Hollywood, as a new-comer, I thought they would be impressed by that. But no, they didn't care. I bought a house and Mercedes; they didn't care. I had William Morris working for me; not a dent. So the problem was that in those days Hollywood just wasn't writing roles for Indians or Asians in general. And when they did have a role for Asians, they had no hesitation in painting a white actor brown. So I told my agent that 'cast me for anything that is foreign looking in Hollywood', and that's how I got my roles! In the 'James Bond' film I was actually cast as a Indian. But in 'Bold and Beautiful', I played a Morrocan prince... In those days Ben Kingsley had to change his name from Krishna Bhanji to get roles. Today a Priyanka Chopra doesn't have to change her name to get success in America.\"On this Priyanka shared her own experience of moving from Bollywood to Hollywood. She said, \"I didn't have to change my name but I had to teach people how to say my name. I had to be ethinically ambigious to a certain extend to be able to get mainstremam roles...\"Kabir also talked about his interview with The Beatles\u2014 which was a turning point in his career which took him from All India Radio in Delhi, to the world of advertising and theatre in Mumbai, and finally into movies. \"My book is an emotional journey of my making, breaking and re-making as a man,\" he said.'Stories I Must Tell: The Emotional Life of an Actor' is published by Westland Publications."}

'Desi Delicacies: Food Writing from Muslim South Asia', a new anthology of food writing, aims at bringing recipes and stories-- both popular and unknown-- from the Muslim South Asia to readers across the world.'Desi Delicacies' is a collection of essays, stories and recipes written by various contributors including Nadeem Aslam, Rana Safvi, Tabish Khair, Annie Zaidi, Sarvat Hasin, Tarana Husain Khan, Sadaf Hussain, Rosie Dastgir among others. The book is edited by Claire Chambers, Professor of Global Literature- University of York, and it highlights how food is interwined with social life and politics in the Indian subcontinent. For instance in 'Cows Come Home', Annie Zaidi writes a story about beef-lynching. The book isn't too political as it also focuses on food heritage, family bonding and memories about food. For example: Rana Safvi writes about the Awadhi cuisine's history and how qormas originated or Sadaf Hussain tells the story behind how samosas started being paired with chai.While giving a glimpse of the food culture of Muslims in South Asia, the book also tries to clarify some common myths about Muslim food-- like it is mainy just biryani and kababs. This anthology is written by some of the most popular historians, chefs and writers from South Asia which makes it an interesting read."}
