And, today, we just took him in a car to the hospital, where he had undergone a major operation in 2019, got the vaccine shot, and came back,\" he said.\n\nHe is feeling fine and has not exhibited any adverse effects post immunisation, the son said, adding, that he performed his daily ''puja'' after returning home.\n\n\"When the pandemic hit us all last year and we got to learn about the 1918 Spanish Flu too, I used to ask my dad about that time, but he was just a five-year-old boy then, and with age and infirmity, his memory has faded, along with reduced eyesight and hearing capacity,\" Mr Krishna told PTI.\n\nHe said his father was born in Kartarpur in Jallandhar district on August 4, 1913, just a year before the outbreak of the World War I.\n\n\"In 1930s, he moved to Delhi, and worked in the home and defence ministries, and was later part of the drafting committee of the Constituent Assembly of India. My father really worked hard, and made his way up the ranks. After Independence, he went on to become a deputy secretary in Rajya Sabha,\" the son said.\n\nOld sepia-toned image of a group photograph taken in February 1948 with B R Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution, sitting in front at the centre and Kewal Krishan standing behind him, is part of the well-preserved family archives, he said.\n\n\"We have got this picture and a few other photos related to the making of the Constitution framed for posterity. In another photos, one can see Jawaharlal Nehru signing on the Constitution, with my father watching him close by. These are pieces of history in our family collections now, and we treasure it,,\" Anil Krishna said.\n\nSo, he has seen the World War I era and the Spanish Flu that followed it, the making of the Constitution, the Independence of India in 1947, and making of the Republic in 1950, and the COVID-19 pandemic, and now got his vaccine shot. That's quite a spectrum of experience in a lifetime, and he will soon turn 108, he said, adding that \"I and my wife got vaccinated recently.\"\n\nThe vaccine shot was given to him at the Fortis Escorts Heart Institute (FEHI) in south Delhi, a spokesperson of the facility said.\n\nIn July 2019, Kewal Krishan had undergone carotid artery stent implantation at FEHI, after suffering multiple repeated minor strokes that had caused \"transient paralysis and loss of speech of right side of the body\", and he was on the \"verge of permanent paralysis,\" doctors at the facility said.\n\n\"Investigations revealed that he had a 95 per cent calcified left carotid artery stenosis (blockage in the main artery supplying the left half of brain), following which the surgery was done,\" a senior doctor said.\n\nAnother centenarian, Tulsi Das Chawla, who was born a few months before the outbreak of the Spanish Flu, had received his first shot of COVID-19 vaccine at a private facility here on March 5.\n\nChawla, 104, was given a dose of Covieshield at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and he had not exhibited any adverse effects on that day."}

The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which later arrested him, is probing if the CCTV footage from the DVR had been tampered with. It is also looking into the possibility of Mr Vaze having brought the SUV to his own residential compound.\n\nThe Mahindra Scorpio carrying gelatin sticks was found on Mumbai's Carmichael Road, near Mr Ambani's Antilia building, on February 25.

{"source": "NDTV", "headline": "What's Government's Beef With Bitcoin, Really?", "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/whats-governments-beef-with-bitcoin-really-2391664", "content": "Contradictory statements and media leaks are making it impossible to get a handle on India's soon-to-be-unveiled cryptocurrency policy. The uncertainty is throwing young blockchain firms and programmers into a paroxysm of anxiety: Should they leave or stay? If they hang back, should they do something else with their lives?\n\nOn Sunday, the global crypto industry heaved a sigh of relief when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman categorically ruled out a much-feared blanket ban, promising to allow a window for people \"to do certain experiments\" using distributed ledger technologies, Bitcoin and other virtual currencies, she said at an India Today conclave.\n\nBut before the ink could dry on the congratulatory press releases from entrepreneurs, Reuters cited an official with direct knowledge of the plan as saying that the new law will \"criminalize possession, issuance, mining, trading and transferring crypto-assets.\"\n\nThat will be nothing short of a second existential crisis in three years. India's crypto evangelists fought a brave legal fight - a couple of them even went behind bars for a short while - against the monetary authority's 2018 diktat to banks, telling them not to allow anyone dealing in digital assets to operate an account. Last year, the nascent blockchain industry won when the country's highest court set aside the Reserve Bank of India's order.\n\nOptimism started to rebuild, and surging Bitcoin prices began to lure millennials. When it comes to transferring Bitcoin and other digital assets, India is of late providing more volume than China on popular peer-to-peer platforms.\n\nThe risk that India would hit back with a new law to make criminals out of crypto professionals and investors was always present. So practitioners tried to educate policymakers, appealing for sensible regulation starting with definitions for what is a utility token, which digital asset is to be viewed as a security, and which is to be treated as a currency.\n\nImage Credites: Bloomberg Opinion\n\nThe trouble is with bureaucrats. They say they want blockchain, but not cryptocurrencies. It's as silly as wanting airports with duty-free shops but no flights. From the Reuters story, it doesn't appear that the final regulation will be much different from what a draft bill had recommended in 2019. A government panel report, which had provided the backdrop for the draft legislation, said that authorities would be fine with distributed ledger technologies for delivery of any services, or \"for creating value,\" without involving cryptocurrencies \"for making or receiving payment.\"\n\nSuch a dichotomy will be messy in practice. Take international money transfers, where costs pile up because of payment messages that have to laboriously jump national borders by using correspondent banks. To provide value, the service provider will need to employ virtual payment tokens, something that the Philippines and Bangladesh are already allowing. India, the world's largest recipient of overseas remittances, won't want to miss out.\n\nTo see where India might be going with its policy flip-flops, consider something else Sitharaman said at the conclave. A lot of the experiments that fintech firms are doing in blockchain, she said, will be taken up \"in a big way\" in the offshore financial center in Gift City in Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state. A startup meet is planned there, she said.\n\nNow, it may be an excellent idea to fill up a ghost town with 20-something programmers since 40-something Mumbai bankers won't go there. Perhaps even the code writers don't have to leave behind the city lights of Bangalore and Hyderabad and head for the boondocks. As long as resident Indian investors are allowed to freely park in Gift City some of the $250,000 they're permitted to take overseas annually, the offshore center could in theory channel some dollar liquidity to the crypto industry. The domestic banking system will steer clear of crypto. The central bank's sway over the rupee would remain intact.\n\nSuch a compromise solution will leave the blockchain industry cold. Yes, there'll be a sandbox for local fintech to play and learn. But there will be no pathway for enterprises to grow into mature businesses. That's because when they want to graduate from segregated dollar accounts and enter the mainstream of the domestic economy, they'll bump up against the crypto ban ~CHECK~ if there's one in place.\n\nIt's unclear how exactly authorities will catch people in possession of virtual currencies. The two obvious chokepoints are banks and the telecom network. If someone is using a VPN service to access the internet, and not buying or selling Bitcoin using an Indian bank account (but earning and spending it peer to peer), the prohibition won't be enforceable.\n\nToday, the popular person-to-person payment choice is Bitcoin, which isn't surprising given its $60,000 price tag. After Beijing rolls out its digital yuan in 2022, even the e-CNY could gain international acceptance as a means of payment and store of value. Rather than complain then about Chinese incursions in India's monetary sovereignty, New Delhi should enact a practical crypto law now.\n\nA regulatory sandbox in Mumbai, where most of India's financial industry resides, would give the authorities ideas for designing a smart official paperless currency.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further compounded the situation, posing serious challenges to the fragile health infrastructure. There is an urgent need to increase humanitarian assistance to all Syrians throughout the country without discrimination, politicisation, and any preconditions,\" Mr Tirumurti said.\n\nHe emphasised that the humanitarian crisis, exacerbated by the pandemic, \"calls for relaxation of sanctions imposed on Syria. The international community must act with a sense of urgency to help the Syrian people.\"\n\nHe voiced conviction that all efforts towards improving the humanitarian situation in Syria will positively impact the political track as well and called upon the wider UN system, in particular the World Health Organization and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to prioritise the vaccination programme in Syria, including through the COVAX initiative.\n\nMr Tirumurti described as \"disheartening\" that the conflict in Syria marks 10 years, peace and stability unfortunately remain elusive to the country and its people.\n\nThe political transition in Syria facilitated by the UN is not the only process presently underway and the five rounds of meetings of the drafting body of the Syrian constitutional committee have resulted in very little progress. \"External influence is also adversely impacting the process,\" he said.\n\n\"The situation on the ground does not present an optimistic picture either. It will be unrealistic to expect any dramatic outcomes in the near future, unless the international community takes decisive collective steps in the right direction,\" he said, adding that if there is seriousness about achieving progress, there is need to have greater convergence of views and act to strengthen the hands of the Special Envoy Geir Pedersen.\n\nConstructive international diplomacy is the need of the hour to bridge existing divides by focusing on mutual and reciprocal steps, he said.\n\nIn late December last year, UN human rights expert Alena Douhan had called on the US to remove unilateral sanctions against Syria, saying the sanctions imposed under the Caesar Act may \"exacerbate the already dire humanitarian situation in Syria, especially in the course of COVID-19 pandemic, and put the Syrian people at even greater risk of human rights violations.\"\n\nThe Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, also known as the Caesar Act, contains the most wide-ranging US sanctions ever applied against Syria, a UN Human Rights statement had said.\n\nIt added that the broad sweep of the US sanctions law that went into effect in June last year could target any foreigner helping in reconstruction of the conflict-ridden country, and even employees of foreign companies and humanitarian operators helping rebuild Syria.\n\nIn remarks to the press following the briefing to the Council, Pedersen said the Syrian conflict has now lasted for the same period as the First World War and the Second World War and the Syrian people must feel that they are really trapped in an endless conflict.\n\nWhile there is a way forward, there is a need to find a way around the \"you first\" syndrome that has dominated much of the diplomacy around Syria for the last decade, he said.\n\n\"Right now, there are what I call 'demands on all sides'' - but little movement on any side. And this dynamic has to change,\" Pedersen said, adding that what is needed at the moment is to identify with realism and precision and implement in parallel mutual and reciprocal steps from Syrian and international players.\n\n\"All players - including the Syrian government and opposition, and key international players - would need to be ready to identify not only what they realistically hope to achieve, but what they can put on the table,\" he said.\n\nMr Tirumurti reiterated that delinking humanitarian and developmental work with progress on the political track will help in creating a conducive environment of trust and confidence.\n\nHe further noted that the Syrian conflict and involvement of external actors has contributed to the growth of terrorism in Syria and in its neighbouring countries, an issue that has been reiterated in the latest report of the Secretary General on the threat posed by ISIL.\n\n\"We express our serious concern with the increased presence and terrorist activity of 'Hayat Tahrir al-Sham'' and other affiliated terrorist groups that pose a threat to civilians inside and outside the Idlib de-escalation area,\" he said.\n\n\"India firmly believes that long-term security and stability in this region can only be achieved by preserving the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria. We also remain convinced that there can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict and reaffirm our commitment to advancing a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned UN-facilitated political process\" in line with relevant UNSC resolution.\n\nIndia has extended developmental assistance and human resource development support to Syria regularly, including lines of credits for developmental projects and supply of medicine and food.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}

Bertossa first solicited the advice in a July 23 letter to the Swiss Institute of Comparative Law.\n\nBertossa's request for an opinion came just a month after Spanish Supreme Court prosecutors announced they would investigate whether Juan Carlos, who abdicated and lost his immunity from prosecution in 2014, could be pursued for possible crimes linked to a high-speed train contract in Saudi Arabia won by a Spanish-Saudi consortium.\n\nBertossa's scrutiny of King Abdullah, the half-brother of the current king, could roil Switzerland's longstanding role as a preferred destination for Saudi wealth. Middle Eastern investors had 432 billion Swiss francs ($464 billion) stored in the country at the end of 2019, according to the Swiss Bankers Association, nearly a fifth of the total. Saudis flock to Geneva every July and August to avoid the fierce desert heat, staying in luxury villas along Lake Geneva.\n\nThe Saudi government's Center for International Communication didn't respond to emailed questions. The Saudi Ministry of Finance, which transmitted the $100 million payment, declined to comment on the reason. Bertossa's office declined to comment on his probe and the reported links between the transfer and the rail contract.\n\nIn his letter, Bertossa said his probe had been focused on \"determining whether this alleged gift should be connected to a corruption scheme.\" The letter didn't mention the rail contract.\n\nEven \"assuming the hypothesis that this payment was a gift,\" he continued, it begged the question of whether there was \"disloyal mismanagement of public interests on the part of the former king of Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nBertossa referred in his letter to an offense in the Swiss Criminal Code that translates as \"misconduct in public office\" in the official English-language version.\n\nMadrid Thank-You\n\nThe payment was a thank you from King Abdullah for Juan Carlos's help organizing a conference in Madrid on religious understanding, according to a Saudi diplomat cited by Spanish newspaper El Pais. The paper reported last year that Bertossa, in a separate letter to a Spanish judge, drew a direct link between the contract and the Saudi payment, and said that the winning bidders offered a discount of as much as 30%.\n\nQualifying for the multibillion-dollar contract had already begun in 2008, the year of the Saudi payment. The two separate tenders for the Phase 1 civil engineering works and the Phase 2 rail contract were then finalized in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The consortium that won the Phase 2 contract in 2011 said in a statement it denies making any agreement or payment related to the award of the project.\n\nIn international cases, Swiss prosecutors often prefer to establish whether a comparable offense exists both in Switzerland and the country in question before proceeding with a fresh line of inquiry.\n\nAccording to the Swiss institute's December response, seen by Bloomberg, misconduct in public office as defined in the Swiss Criminal Code also exists in Saudi Arabia and would, in theory, be punishable under Saudi law with a sentence of as much as 10 years and a fine of 20,000 riyals ($5,330). But the written opinion didn't address the specifics of the case Bertossa is investigating and so didn't discuss the prospect of immunity for a monarch -- living or dead.\n\nThe author of the opinion at the institute, a research center attached to the Swiss Federal Department of Justice, declined to comment.\n\nPanama Foundation\n\nThe money at the center of the inquiry was paid into the Panama-registered Lucum Foundation. The foundation, of which Juan Carlos was the sole beneficiary, was established to receive the Saudi donation and was dissolved around 2012. Juan Carlos left Spain for the United Arab Emirates last year, according to the BBC.\n\nHis lawyer, Javier Sanchez-Junco, didn't respond to requests for comment. The Swiss bank which received the payment and has been investigated by Bertossa denies any wrongdoing.\n\nBertossa's inquiries come as Saudi Arabia's current heir to the throne, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has declared fighting corruption a key priority. In 2017, the prince turned Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel into a temporary jail during a controversial anti-corruption campaign that targeted Saudi's elite. Most of the detainees were released after agreeing to hand over billions of dollars in private settlements. Dissidents say the prince uses corruption allegations selectively to undermine potential opponents and critics, a charge officials deny.\n\nKing Abdullah reigned for nearly a decade until his death in 2015 at age 90, when he was replaced by King Salman, the crown prince's father.\n\nGiven that King Abdullah is no longer alive, Bertossa's next steps in his investigation are unclear. As Geneva's top prosecutor, however, he typically juggles other financial crimes and corruption cases at the same time.\n\nIn January, Bertossa secured a surprise conviction of Israel mining tycoon Beny Steinmetz for bribery, in what was heralded as a landmark decision for the prosecution of commodities-related corruption. Steinmetz denies any wrongdoing and is appealing the verdict.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}

warning for the United States.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un's influential sister warned the United States against actions that could make it \"lose sleep\", state media reported Tuesday, as top Biden administration officials began a visit to key allies Tokyo and Seoul.\n\nPentagon chief Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Japan on Monday on their first overseas trip, aimed at rallying military alliances as a bulwark against China and cementing a united front against the nuclear-armed North.\n\nThe statement by Kim Yo Jong, a key adviser to her brother, was Pyongyang's first explicit reference to the new president in Washington, more than four months after Joe Biden was elected to replace Donald Trump -- although it still did not mention the Democrat by name.\n\nThe United States and South Korea began joint military exercises last week and Pyongyang's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried a statement from her offering \"a word of advice to the new administration of the United States that is struggling to spread the smell of gunpowder on our land\".\n\n\"If you wish to sleep well for the next four years, it would be better not to create work from the start that will make you lose sleep,\" she said.\n\nTrump's unorthodox approach to foreign policy saw him trade insults and threats of war with Kim Jong Un before an extraordinary diplomatic bromance that saw a series of headline-grabbing meetings.\n\nBut ultimately no progress was made towards Washington's declared aim of denuclearising North Korea, which is under multiple international sanctions for its banned weapons programmes.\n\nIt has isolated itself further, imposing a strict border closure to protect itself against the coronavirus pandemic that first emerged in neighbouring China.\n\nShortly before Biden's January inauguration, leader Kim decried the US as his country's \"foremost principal enemy\" and Pyongyang unveiled a new submarine-launched ballistic missile at a military parade.\n\n- 'March of war' -\n\nThe talks process was brokered by South Korea's President Moon Jae-in but relations between Seoul and Pyongyang have been in deep freeze since Kim and Trump's summit in Hanoi collapsed in February 2019.\n\nKim Yo Jong is a trusted adviser to her brother and was a key voice when inter-Korean tensions mounted last year, culminating in the North blowing up a liaison office on its side of the border.\n\nShin Beom-chul, a researcher at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy, pointed out that her announcements have previously represented incremental steps by Pyongyang.\n\n\"North Korea has judged that the US will not offer enough concessions and so has released this statement ahead of Blinken and Austin's visit to Seoul,\" he told AFP.\n\nThere was a \"high possibility\" of a military provocation by the North during or immediately after the Americans' trip, he added.\n\nSeoul and Washington are treaty allies, with the United States stationing around 28,500 troops in South Korea to defend it against its neighbour, and they began computer-simulated joint military exercises last week.\n\nThe North always condemns such drills as preparations for invasion, and in her statement, Kim Yo Jong said: \"The South Korean government yet again chose the 'March of War', the 'March of Crisis' rather than a 'warm March' before all the people.\"\n\n\"It will not be easy for the warm spring days of three years ago to come back if the South Korean government follows whatever instructions of its master,\" she added, threatening to scrap a North-South military agreement if Seoul acts \"more provocatively\".\n\n- New York channel -\n\nAustin and Blinken arrived in Tokyo on Monday and will be consulting with both it and Seoul on the new administration's review of US policy towards Pyongyang, but China will be the main focus of their discussions.\n\nBeijing presents multiple challenges to Washington on trade and diplomatic fronts, and is also the North's key diplomatic backer and main provider of business and aid.\n\nWashington has attempted to reach out to Pyongyang \"through several channels starting in mid-February, including in New York\", state department deputy spokesperson Jalina Porter told reporters on Monday.\n\n\"To date, we've not received any response from Pyongyang,\" she added.\n\nThe \"New York channel\" is a reference to the North's mission to the United Nations, as Pyongyang and Washington do not maintain diplomatic relations.\n\nAustin and Blinken are due to arrive in South Korea on Wednesday before the defence secretary heads to India while the diplomat returns to the United States for talks with Chinese officials."}

For example, imposition of sanctions -- that can impact on food security or or availability of goods,\" he said.\n\nThe foreign secretary said what happens in Myanmar does impact on India one way or the other.\n\n\"We are the immediate neighbour of Myanmar. We share a 1700-km border. There are strong community linkages between people who live on our side and those who live across the border,\" he said.\n\n\"We as a strong democracy have been very very proactive in assisting and facilitating the process of Myanmar's democratic transition and so obviously the recent developments have been somewhat of a setback and somewhat of concern for us,\" he said.\n\nThe foreign secretary said India has undertaken several humanitarian projects that are important for the people of Myanmar.\n\n\"We intend to continue with those but at the same time we are happy to play our role in facilitating a resolution of the issue as it unfolds as the situation becomes clearer, working with all concerned,\" he said.\n\nMr Shringla also expressed the hope that violence is avoided."}

These taxes, with excise duty, in particular, have been raised periodically.\n\nWhile the taxes haven't come down, a spike in global oil prices on demand recovery has pushed petrol and diesel to an all-time high, leading to demand for them come under the GST.\n\n\"At present, there is no proposal to bring crude petroleum, petrol, diesel, ATF and natural gas under GST,\" Ms Sitharaman said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.\n\nShe said the law prescribes that the GST Council shall recommend the date on which the goods and services tax be levied on petroleum crude, high-speed diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas and ATF.\n\n\"So far, the GST Council, in which the states are also represented, has not made any recommendation for inclusion of these goods under GST,\" she said.\n\nThe Council may consider the issue of inclusion of these five petroleum products at a time it considers appropriate keeping in view all the relevant factors, including revenue implication, she added.\n\nIncluding oil products in GST will not just help companies set off tax that they paid on input but will also bring about uniformity in taxation on the fuels in the country.\n\nMs Sitharaman has in recent weeks talked of inclusion of fuel under GST as well as centre and states taking a joint call on cutting taxes to cushion consumers against the spike in retail prices.\n\nTo a separate question, her junior in the finance ministry, Anurag Singh Thakur said excise duty on petrol was Rs 19.98 per litre a year back and is Rs 32.9 now. Similarly, on diesel, the excise duty has been raised from Rs 15.83 to Rs 31.8.\n\n\"The excise duty rates have been calibrated to generate resources for infrastructure and other developmental items of expenditure keeping in view the present fiscal position,\" Mr Thakur, Minister of State for Finance, said giving reasons for raising the levy.\n\nOn the impact of higher fuel rates on general prices, he said ''petrol for vehicle'' inflation has increased from 7.38 per cent in January 2020 to 12.53 per cent in January this year.\n\nSimilarly, ''diesel for vehicle'' inflation has increased from 6.44 per cent in January last year to 12.79 per cent this year, he said.\n\nOn fuel pricing, Mr Thakur said the prices of petroleum products in the country are benchmarked to international product prices.\n\n\"Generally, the price of petroleum products in the country are higher/lower than other countries due to a variety of factors, including prevailing tax regime and subsidy compensations by the respective Governments,\" he said.\n\nThe government ended subsidies on petrol in 2010 and on diesel in 2014.

The Neighbourhood First policy emphasizes both,\" he said.\n\nThe foreign secretary also said the volume of total trade with Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal and Sri Lanka has increased from $19.44 billion to $26.455 billion in the last six years.\n\n\"Greater economic integration within regions has been known to produce a whole that is larger than the sum of parts.

An inter-connected region with higher economic growth fosters trade and investment opportunities that offer the region a win-win situation,\" he said.\n\nOn Pakistan, he said any meaningful dialogue can only be held in a conducive atmosphere and the onus is on Pakistan to create such an atmosphere.\n\nReferring to Myanmar, Mr Shringla said India has been steadfast in its support to the process of democratic transition in that country.\n\n\"Our developmental and humanitarian efforts in Myanmar have been aimed at the socio-economic development of the country. We need to continue with these efforts in the interest of the people of Myanmar. We feel that people on the ground should not suffer,\" he said.\n\n\"India will continue to closely monitor the situation and remain engaged with like-minded countries to meet the hopes and aspirations of the people of the country. The international community must work together and lend its meaningful support at this critical juncture, so that the people of Myanmar do not suffer,\" he said.\n\nOn enhancing regional transport links, Mr Shringla mentioned the proposed Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) connectivity initiative and said it can, through Myanmar, provide a link to East and South East Asia.\n\n\"Future plans to enhance connectivity include extending the trilateral highway to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. Railways that link India and Myanmar and further to Thailand, Laos, Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh are all in the realm of possibility,\" he said.\n\nThe India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway project is being implemented.\n\nMr Shringla also spoke about the need for regional energy cooperation.\n\n\"We understand that geography and the distribution of resources can be leveraged for greater integration and we are working assiduously to promote the sub-region comprising Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar and India as well as Sri Lanka as an energy hub,\" he said."}

If yes, under which law and by whose orders?\"\n\nIn its reply given recently, the Home Department stated that telephones are intercepted in the interest of public safety and order.\n\n\"The telephones are intercepted under the provision of Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and Section 419 (A) of the Indian Telegraph (Amendment) Rules, 2007, and Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 -- after approval by a competent officer,\" according to the reply.\n\nThe department further states, \"Interception cases are reviewed by the chief secretary. All cases up to the month of November 2020 have been reviewed.\" Neither the MLA asked details about any particular person whose phone was tapped nor did the government gave any specific information about it.\n\nHowever on Monday, the BJP attacked the government over the issue and demanded Mr Gehlot's resignation, accusing him of misleading the public.\n\nUnion Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhwat in a series of tweets accused the Congress of using government machinery to contain rebellion inside the party by tapping phones.\n\nBJP's Rajasthan chief Satish Poonia demanded a CBI inquiry into the matter. \"This is what the BJP had said in July last year - 'Emergency is going on in Rajasthan'. The Gehlot government denied it at the time, and is now accepting that the phones were tapped. This is a violation of privacy, the murder of democracy,\" Mr Shekhawat tweeted.\n\n\"There is a question from the public that why was phone tapping done using government machinery to contain the internal rebellion of the Congress Party? Why did the Congress government use the administration in its own interest? This is an illegal process,\" he said.\n\nMr Shekhawat alleged that the Congress trapped phones of its own MLAs, including a \"young leader\".\n\n\"Insult at peak has been the tradition of the Congress. How can the Rajasthanis trust a government that does not trust its MLAs,\" he asked. Meanwhile, state BJP chief Satish Poonia alleged that lies were told and facts were tempered with.\n\n\"The chief minister, who holds the home portfolio, is guilty of this,\" Mr Poonia told reporters here, demanding that the chief minister should resign on moral grounds and the matter should be investigated by the CBI.\n\nTrashing the charges, the Congress said it did not tap phone of any MLA or MP.\n\n\"The government in a reply to the question has mentioned the process of phone interception under the law. After permission from competent authority, it is done. The Rajasthan government has not tapped phone of any MLA or minister,\" Mr Joshi said.\n\n\"If Gajendra Singh Shekhawat is so confident that phones were tapped, why he does not give his voice samples. It will prove whether the phone was tapped or not,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, RLP's Nagaur MP Hanuman Beniwal said the state government indulged in an illegal act.\n\nHe alleged phone tapping took place during the rule of Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government also and demanded an inquiry into matter.\n\nA controversy over phone tapping had erupted last year after audio clips purportedly having telephonic conversation between Union minister Gajendra Singh and Congress leaders surfaced.\n\nCongress leaders of the Ashok Gehlot camp had alleged that BJP leaders were involved in horse trading to topple the state government.\n\nThe state government had rejected allegations of phone tapping.\n\nMr Gehlot had categorically stated in the last session of the Assembly that no illegal tapping of phones of any MLA or MP was done in the state."}

He also claimed he had apologized to her and, after talking to Zomato, asked her to return the food but she refused.\n\nThe woman, however, said she never started with abuses, that he was rude first. \"It was my reaction out of fear. I panicked. It was in the heat of the moment, it was not intentional,\" she had told NDTV.\n\nThe two versions of the story have divided the social media and are now under investigation.\n\nAfter the delivery agent's complaint, a case has been registered against the woman under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including 341 (wrongful restraint), 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour person) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).\n\nZomato has said it is supporting both the versions, pending investigations, and wants \"both sides of the story to come to light\"."}

This took place on a day Union minster Amit Shah landed in Kolkata unexpectedly to stay the night on his way from Guwahati to Delhi and BJP chief JP Nadda landed for day-long campaign tomorrow.\n\nDramatic visuals from outside the BJP's election office at Hastings showed hundreds of people jostling and shouting and pushing aside barricades in a bid to force their way into the building. A large police contingent was deployed to control the situation. Several BJP offices in the districts were ransacked.\n\nThe earliest protestors to show up came in around 2 pm from Panchla in Howrah. They sat on dharna outside the office with banners and posters calling the BJP candidate Mohit Ghati \"characterless, drunkard\". They were joined by protestors from Udaynarayanpur, also in Howrah. In the evening, people swarmed in from Raidighi in South 24 Parganas.\n\nPolice put up iron barricades outside the entry to the building housing the BJP offices on the fourth, seventh and eighth floor but the crowds repeatedly surged forward, trying to pull them down and forcibly enter the building. The face-off continued till late in the evening.\n\nAlso in the evening, agitated BJP workers ransacked the party office at Singur and the BJP's district headquarters office at Chinsura, both in the Hooghly district.\n\nSingur had seen trouble yesterday too, soon after former Trinamool MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya was named the BJP candidate. The Madhya Pradesh education and health minister, there for organisational meetings, was locked up inside a shop where he was in discussion with party workers.\n\nThe police rescued him after four hours of incarceration.\n\nOn Monday, the BJP workers locked the office in the day and vandalised it in the evening.\n\nWhat could be more worrying for the BJP is the ransacking of its office at Chinsura where the BJP has fielded not a former Trinamool leader but its sitting MP Locket Chatterjee.\n\nSources say these seats had strong local contenders for tickets. Their supporters have rebelled, threatening to field Independent candidates to defeat official BJP candidates even if it meant Trinamool sails through.\n\nJoy Banerjee, a BJP leader who has not been given a ticket, said, \"I am thinking of changing my platform\".\n\nThis is unfortunate but a temporary situation, BJP spokesman Samik Bhattacharya was quoted saying.\n\nFor the BJP, the candidate list for the state's 294 seats was expected to be a tough balancing act.\n\nOver the last months, a steady stream of leaders from the state's ruling Trinamool Congress has crossed over to the BJP \u2013 leaders who knew they would not get tickets again, the Trinamool had jeered.\n\nThe BJP has given many of them tickets but upset its own party workers.\n\nOn its list for the third and fourth phase of polls announced Saturday, the BJP named 27 and 38 candidates respectively. The list included several movie stars, eight Trinamool defectors and four sitting MPs, including the party's two-time Union minister Babul Supriyo.\n\nThe list had drawn barbs from Trinamool, which is seeking a third straight term in the state.\n\nThe party's fiery MP Mohua Moitra, known for her outspoken remarks inside the parliament and out, had summed it up. \"Loving this slow unfolding of the WB BJP Candidate List soap opera. When \"largest global political party\" lacks enough faces & strength to announce 294 names in one go for a state it claims it will sweep!\" her tweet read.\n\nThe mammoth eight-phase elections in Bengal will begin on March 27 and continue till April 29. The votes will be counted on May 2."}

India observes National Vaccination Day to convey to the people of the country the importance of vaccination. For over a hundred and fifty years, vaccines have saved people from diseases that would have hampered progress of humanity. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, vaccines have brought the world together in a way that we have never seen before. India has emerged a leader in the vaccination drive against the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWhat is vaccination and immunization?\n\nPeople often use the two words, vaccination and immunization, interchangeably. But there is a fundamental difference between the two. While vaccination is the act of giving or administering the vaccine, immunization refers to becoming immune to certain diseases after taking the vaccine shot. Vaccination and immunization are very important in a country's basic health care. Timely vaccination prevents two to three million deaths every year from preventable diseases, according to experts.\n\nWhat are vaccines and how do they work?\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), \"Vaccines contain weakened or inactive parts of a particular organism (antigen) that triggers an immune response within the body.\" When a person receives the vaccine shot, he or she is \"very likely to be protected against the targeted disease\". But the WHO says, \"not everyone can be vaccinated\" as they may have \"underlying health conditions that weaken their immune systems\".\n\nIn 2021, the WHO, with its partners globally have decided to unite to:\n\n\"Increase trust and confidence in vaccines to maintain or increase vaccine acceptance\"\n\n\"Increase investment in vaccines, including routine immunization, to remove barriers to access\"\n\n\"In the last two decades, India has made significant progress in improving health indicators, particularly those related to child health. The country was certified polio-free in 2014 and eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus in 2015, according to the UNICEF."}

The virus has killed more than 2.7 million people.\n\nThailand became the first country outside Europe to delay rolling out the vaccine on Friday, when its political leaders were due to have the first shots, but the government said on Monday they would receive the AstraZeneca vaccine on Tuesday.\n\nIndonesia, however, said it would delay administering the shot due to the reports of blood clots among some recipients in Europe and would await a review from the WHO.\n\nThe WHO had already said there was no indication the events were caused by the vaccination, a view also expressed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which said the number of reported blood clots was no higher than seen in the general population.\n\nThe handful of reported side-effects in Europe have upset vaccination programmes already under pressure over slow rollouts and vaccine scepticism in some countries.\n\nThe Netherlands said on Monday it had seen 10 cases of possible noteworthy adverse side-effects from the AstraZeneca vaccine, hours after the government put its vaccination programme on hold following reports of potential side-effects in other countries.\n\nDenmark reported \"highly unusual\" symptoms in a 60-year-old citizen who died from a blood clot after receiving the vaccine, the same phrase used on Saturday by Norway about three people under the age of 50 it said were being treated in hospital.\n\n\"It was an unusual course of illness around the death that made the Danish Medicines Agency react,\" the agency said in a statement late on Sunday.\n\nAstraZeneca Plc said earlier it had conducted a review covering more than 17 million people vaccinated in the European Union and the UK which had shown no evidence of an increased risk of blood clots.\n\nPolitical Row\n\nIn Germany, the question marks over the vaccine caused a political row, with the leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), Markus Soeder, saying the country needed clear guidance from its own experts.\n\nNoting that some other EU countries had stopped using the vaccine, Soeder told a news conference: \"That's why there has to be an extra clear statement in Germany: is the vaccine good or bad?\"\n\nThe health ministry said the country was continuing to use the vaccine according to EMA guidelines.\n\nThe reports of potential safety risks are taken seriously and data is examined constantly, a ministry spokesman told Reuters. Further proceedings would be discussed with the European and the national vaccine regulators this week, he said.\n\nInvestigations into potential side-effects are complicated as the history of each case and circumstances surrounding a death or illness are examined. The Austrian authorities have said their review of the AstraZeneca batch will take about two weeks.\n\nThe EMA has said that as of March 10, a total of 30 cases of blood clotting had been reported among close to 5 million people vaccinated with the AstraZeneca shot in the European Economic Area, which links 30 European countries.\n\nThe WHO said that as of March 12, more than 300 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been administered around the world with no cases of death found to have been caused by any of them.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}

The encounter between the Delhi police and a bunch of terrorists holed up in the South Delhi neighbourhood had led to the death of Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma while two others sustained injuries.\n\nA native of Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, Khan was arrested by the Delhi police's Special Cell in February 2018 after fleeing the spot in 2008. He was convicted in the case last week. Khan is also the alleged mastermind of the 2008 serial blasts across Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nThe police sought the death penalty for Khan saying it was not just any killing but a murder of a law enforcement officer who was a defender of justice. Additional Public Prosecutor AT Ansari, appearing for the police, said the case attracts exemplary punishment, which is capital punishment.\n\nAdvocate MS Khan, appearing for Ariz Khan, opposed the death penalty and said the incident was not premeditated.\n\nThe court had said on March 8 that it was \"duly proved that Ariz Khan and his associates caused the murder of police official and fired gunshot on the police official\".\n\nCalling it one of the \"rarest of the rare cases\" that merit the death penalty, Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav on Monday also imposed a total fine of Rs 11 lakh against Khan. The court said Rs 10 lakh should be immediately released to the family members of Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma.\n\nIn 2013, one Shahzad Ahmed, who, too, had escaped the Batla House shootout with Khan, was convicted and sentenced. Two of their accomplices, Atif Amin and Mohammed Sajid, were killed in the incident. A third, Mohammed Saif, was arrested from the location.\n\nThe multiple bombings linked to Ariz Khan rocked cities like Jaipur and Ahmedabad, apart from the national capital itself, in 2008 and saw 165 people losing their lives and over 500 injured in all. A reward of Rs 15 lakh had been declared on him, besides an Interpol Red Corner Notice.\n\nA BTech graduate from Muzaffaranagar's SD College, Khan is an explosives expert. He was inculcated into the jihadi network by Atif Amin, who died in the Delhi shootout. After the 2008 blasts, he had shifted his base to Nepal and acquired a Nepal passport under the name Salim. He opened a restaurant there and also taught students.\n\nDuring his Nepal days, he came in contact with Riyaz Bhatkal who then inspired him to relaunch Indian Mujahideen. In 2014, he visited Saudi Arabia, looking to strengthen the terror organisation, and interacted with many IM and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) personnel.\n\nIn 2017, Khan returned from Saudi Arabia to lay the groundwork for IM's revival. He was visiting India on February 13, 2018, when he was arrested at the Banbasa border point between India and Nepal. The police got a whiff of his plans through SIMI activist Abdul Suhan who had been arrested a month earlier."}

The world needs more immunizations, especially as the virus's continuous circulation spawns dangerous new variants and drugmakers struggle to meet orders. Only 122 countries have started immunizing people, according to data collected by Bloomberg.\n\n\"We're thrilled with the vaccines that we have,\" said Swaminathan, an Indian pediatrician best known for her research on tuberculosis and HIV. But \"we can improve further,\" she said. \"I think, well into 2022, we're going to see the emergence of improved vaccines.\"\n\nThe current crop of experimental vaccines use alternative technologies and delivery systems, and include more single-shot inoculations, and vaccines that are administered orally, via a nasal spray, and through the skin using a type of patch. These could bring immunizations that are better suited to specific groups, such as pregnant women, according to Swaminathan.\n\nMore than 80 candidate vaccines are being studied in people, though some are still in the early stages of testing and may not be successful. Companies with Covid-19 vaccines already in use have also begun testing updated versions designed to thwart variants of the coronavirus that have emerged in recent months.\n\nBooster Shots\n\n\"We need to continue to support the research and development of more vaccine candidates, especially as the need for ongoing booster immunization of populations is still not very clear at this point,\" Swaminathan said. \"So we need to be prepared for that in the future.\"\n\nThe WHO's strategic advisory group of experts on immunization is reviewing whether people who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 need to have two doses of vaccine. Some research indicates that a natural infection works to prime the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, much as a first dose would, making a second injection unnecessary.\n\nGiving only one dose of vaccine to Covid-19 survivors could free up more supplies, Swaminathan said, though it could present \"practical and logistical challenges in many countries\" if blood tests are needed to measure patients' antibody levels before deciding if a second jab is warranted.\n\nThe roll out of safe and effective vaccines is also raising questions about how to efficiently and ethically conduct clinical trials of experimental vaccines, she said. Placebos will be replaced with a \"gold standard\" vaccine in a so-called non-inferiority design when it's no longer ethical to use a placebo, Swaminathan said.\n\nGlobal Trial\n\nMeantime, one approach the WHO is exploring is to compare three or four candidate vaccines simultaneously with a placebo. A similar study design was used to test the efficacy of drug therapies for Covid-19, and may mean trial participants would have an 80% chance of receiving an experimental vaccine and only a 20% chance of getting placebo.\n\n\"We are in discussions now with several companies with vaccines in development to see if we could launch something like this on a global trial platform,\" Swaminathan said, adding that she's optimistic such a study may begin in the first half of 2021.\n\nA global trial involving a wide pool of people and countries offers several advantages, she said. Testing vaccines in diverse ethnicities, age groups, and people with different medical conditions makes the results more generalizable, and when the epidemic wanes in some parts of the world it's often still active in others, she said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"}

The case will be heard on Thursday.\n\nMs Chakraborty had been granted bail with conditions nearly a month after her arrest over drugs-related charges in the death of her actor boyfriend Sushant Singh Rajput last year. She was asked to submit a Rs 1 lakh bond and told not leave the country without the court's permission.\n\nEarlier this month, the NCB had named 33 people, including Ms Chakraborty and her brother Showik, in a chargesheet filed before a special court in Mumbai. The document of nearly 12,000 pages had statements recorded of more than 200 witnesses.\n\nShe was accused of being \"an active member of a drugs syndicate\" and financing narcotics used by Sushant Singh Rajput.\n\nRefuting the charges, her lawyer Satish Maneshinde called the chargesheet \"a damp squib\". \"The entire amount of 'Narcotic Substances' 'Recovered' against 33 accused are nothing compared to what even a constable in Mumbai Police or Narcotics Cell or the Airport Customs or other agencies recover from one raid or trap,\" he said.\n\nRhea Chakraborty was arrested on September 8 by the Narcotics Control Bureau on charges of organising drugs for Sushant Singh Rajput, who was found dead in his Mumbai apartment on June 14 last year.\n\nThe High Court, while granting bail, said Rhea Chakraborty \"is not part of a chain of drug dealers\" and \"has not forwarded the drugs allegedly procured by her to somebody else to earn monetary other benefits.\"\n\n\"Since she has no criminal antecedents, there are reasonable grounds for believing that she is not likely to commit any offence while on bail,\" the order said.\n\nThe court also disagreed with the drugs agency's argument that celebrities and role models should be treated harshly to set an example.\n\nIn her bail petition, Rhea Chakraborty had said that she and her brother Showik were sole targets of a witch-hunt by multiple agencies who had found no evidence incriminating her.\n\nShe had alleged that Sushant Singh Rajput \"took advantage of those closest to him to sustain his drug habit\" and that she had tried to rid him of it.\n\nShe also said he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and his family abandoned him at the peak of his depression. His mental health \"deteriorated during the lockdown\", she claimed, adding that the deaths of actors Irrfan Khan and Rishi Kapoor also had a tremendous impact on him.\n\nRhea Chakraborty also argued that the charges against her were too severe compared to the quantity of the drugs involved. She accused the drugs probe agency of spinning a false narrative that she was involved in illegal drugs trafficking and \"harboured offenders\".\n\nThe CBI is investigating the circumstances of Sushant Singh Rajput's death and the Enforcement Directorate is looking into financial allegations raised by the actor's father.\n\nThe Narcotics Control Bureau stepped into the Sushant Singh Rajput investigations when WhatsApp chats retrieved from Rhea Chakraborty's phone revealed alleged conversations involving the procuring of drugs.\n\nSeveral top actors have been questioned by the anti-drugs bureau in a widening probe into drugs and the film industry."}

Fujairah International Oil & Gas Corp., wholly owned by Sheikh Hamad bin Mohammed Al Sharqi, said it's an intermediary seller of the oil, according to a claim filed in a federal court in the District of Columbia.\n\nThe case underscores the difficulty the U.S. faces as it tries to bar Iran from generating income from energy sales and pressure it into re-starting nuclear talks.\n\nWhile shipments of Iranian oil have slumped due to threat of U.S. penalties, they have picked in recent months, though their origin is often disguised. The main buyers are refiners in China.\n\nWashington alleges that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the IRGC-Quds Force -- both classified as terrorist organizations by the U.S. -- covertly shipped the oil abroad, relying on ship-to-ship transfers and falsified documents. Iran said the cargo belonged to the \"private sector\" and that its seizure was an \"act of piracy.\"\n\n\"I'm sure that Iranian oil is continuing to flow,\" said Iman Nasseri, managing director for the Middle East at consulting firm FGE. \"Forging documents like bills of lading and others needed for trades is not that big a problem.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden has proposed that the two nations return to a 2015 international agreement under which Iran limited its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. His predecessor, Donald Trump, pulled the U.S. out of the accord in mid-2018 and tightened sanctions. Tehran says those must end before a new round of talks can begin.\n\nTensions in the Middle East have also mounted recently due to a spate of attacks on ships and energy facilities. Saudi Arabia's Ras Tanura oil-export terminal -- the world's largest -- was attacked by drones and missiles earlier this month. Yemen's Houthi rebels, who are supported by Iran, claimed the assault.\n\nSeveral tankers were targeted with mines in the Red Sea last year, while an Israeli-owned cargo vessel was struck by an explosion in the Persian Gulf in late February. Tehran said on Monday that Israel was probably to blame for a \"sabotage operation\" that damaged an Iranian ship in the Mediterranean Sea last week.\n\nFIOGC said that in June it bought the crude from an undisclosed Iraqi supplier, which presented bills of lading from Iraq's state oil marketer SOMO as proof of origin. FIOGC then stored the oil on a ship at the port of Fujairah, an energy-trading hub on the UAE's Gulf of Oman coast.\n\nCalls placed to SOMO on Sunday weren't answered, while FIOGC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn October, FIOGC sold the oil to an unidentified Chinese buyer. Under the agreement, FIOGC was responsible for delivering the crude and chartered the supertanker Achilleas for the journey to China.\n\nThe U.S. government moved to seize the cargo late last year after the Achilleas' Greek owner, Capital Ship Management Corp., alerted authorities to the possibility it had unknowingly taken on Iranian crude, after believing it came from Iraq.\n\nHouston Discharge\n\nThe Achilleas rerouted to the U.S. and the crude was discharged in Houston this month. FIOGC says it retains a financial stake in the cargo.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice filed a legal case in early February to allow it to seize the oil.\n\nFIOGC was established last year to trade petroleum products, with a primary focus on floating-storage facilities. They were \"particularly important in 2020\" because the coronavirus pandemic hammered demand for oil and traders ran out of space at onshore tanks, according to FIOGC's court filing.\n\nSheikh Hamad is also a member of the UAE's Supreme Council, the country's executive arm. The UAE is one of the U.S.'s closest allies in the region. It's a federation of seven emirates including Fujairah, though Abu Dhabi is the capital and holds the most sway politically."}

We are hoping that once they grow to our level, then definitely we will be able to have collaboration,\" he added.\n\nUnion Minister Jitendra Singh, who heads DoS, has said 35 space startups and industries were in consultation with ISRO for support related to various domains of space activity such as development of satellites, launch vehicles, develop applications, and providing space based services.\n\nISRO's commercial arm NewSpace India Linited (NSIL), incorporated two years ago, is also proactively working to improve the potential of Indian industries by way of technology transfer from ISRO in several identified areas.\n\n\"This will definitely help them play an increasing role in the emerging space markets both nationally and globally.

Jayalalithaa -- \"Amma\" to the AIADMK ranks - enjoyed rare devotion of her party men, who even genuflected to her photos.\n\nE Palaniswami or EPS was among those acolytes, but he was always passed over for the top job despite his loyalty to Jayalalithaa. It was O Panneerselvam or OPS (his deputy), who was always Amma's favourite - and her preferred stand-in when anything kept her from the Chief Minister's chair.\n\nEPS hit the jackpot when, after Jayalalithaa's death, her closest aide VK Sasikala took control of the AIADMK. Sasikala promoted EPS instead of OPS, causing him to revolt.\n\nSuch was Sasikala's faith in EPS that when she was sentenced to jail for corruption, she picked him to take over as Chief Minister, perhaps intending him as a place-holder when she was released four years on.\n\nBut Sasikala - \"Chinnamma\" or aunt to the cadre -- could never command the unquestioning, unstinted loyalty that Jayalalithaa did. EPS patched up with OPS and Sasikala was sacked in her absence.\n\nSince then, EPS's biggest achievement has been to survive and complete the AIADMK's term against all odds, overcoming feuds, intrigues and a challenge from Sasikala's nephew TTV Dhinakaran.\n\nEPS appeared initially shaky but he managed to bring the party and the government under his control. Eighteen pro-Sasikala MLAs lost their seats under anti-defection law and EPS ensured there were no crossovers to Sasikala's camp even after her return from jail.\n\nBorn in the Erode district of Tamil Nadu, 66-year-old EPS is a four-time MLA from the Edappadi constituency. He fought his first state election after the AIADMK suffered a split following the death of its founder MG Ramachandran (MGR) in 1989.\n\nWhen a battle for MGR's legacy raged between his widow Janaki Ramachandran and his protege and former co-star Jayalalithaa, EPS chose to stand by Amma and won. It paid off.\n\nSince then, he has won from the seat four times, including in 1991, 2011 and 2016. He lost in 1996 and 2006. In between, he won from Tiruchengode in the 1998 national election, becoming an MP.\n\nEPS' political graph soared when Jayalalithaa took him in her cabinet in 2011 and gave him charge of the powerful Highways and Minor Ports ministry. He was part of her 2016 cabinet too.\n\nOPS, who belongs to the powerful Thevar community, was Jayalalithaa's choice twice to replace her as Chief Minister when she had to step down following convictions, but his fortunes dipped as he fell into the bad books of Sasikala.\n\nEPS, backed by his strong Gounder community, made OPS deputy Chief Minister and the two shared the role of AIADMK coordinators in a new collective leadership model with an 11-member steering committee.\n\nThe opposition led by the DMK alleges large-scale corruption and irregularities in tenders for mega projects by the EPS government.\n\nThe opposition also accuses the Chief Minister of toeing its ally BJP's line and compromising on federalism in the name of \"cooperating with the centre for Tamil Nadu's growth\".\n\nThe state government has not been able to get exemption from medical entrance test NEET, which the state had done away with for nearly a decade during which medical admissions took place on the basis of class XII marks.\n\nThe alliance with the BJP proved costly for the leadership of EPS and OPS in 2019 as the AIADMK managed to win only one of the state's 39 Lok Sabha seats and the DMK swept the polls.\n\nAs the AIADMK attempts a third term, EPS's party colleagues say he has managed to build a favourable perception around the government's Covid fight. Add to that a slew of populist schemes including the waiver of farm loans, gold loans up to 6 sovereigns, 7.5 per cent quota for government school students in medical admissions and a 10.5 per cent reservation for Vanniyars within the MBC quota.\n\nThe challenge for him would be to beat the split of AIADMK's votes because of Sasikala's nephew Dhinakaran's AMMK and the advantage for DMK, which has already bagged a morale-boosting victory two years ago. For the EPS-led AIADMK, another worry is actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan, who is making an impact in urban pockets."}

She was re-elected with an even greater majority than in 2011, when she ended the Left's decades-long dominance over Bengal using the catchphrase of \"Pariborton (change)\".\n\nDespite the Narada Scam in which almost a dozen senior members of the party were seen taking \"bribes\" in hard cash, she pulled off a landslide in 2016 as well.\n\nThis time, \"Pariborton\" has been flung back at Mamata Banerjee and it is the BJP saying it, with a prefix for good measure - \"Ashol Pariborton (real change)\".\n\nOver the past year, especially in the last few months, the 66-year-old has lost many close aides to the BJP.\n\nHer biggest loss is Suvendu Adhikari, now her worst enemy; the two are rival candidates in Nandigram, where a 15 years ago, they fought and campaigned together, winning Bengal.\n\nChallenged by the BJP, Didi raised the bets by giving up her safe seat Bhowanipore in Kolkata and announcing her contest from Nandigram.\n\nWhether it was brave or foolhardy will be known on May 2.\n\nIn sheer messaging, Mamata Banerjee's point is made. She is not one to back down from a fight.\n\nThe car incident Nandigram, which left the Chief Minister with injuries and her leg in a cast, reminded many of August 1990, when Mamata Banerjee was attacked by Left goons.\n\nMany in the BJP, and even the Congress, have questioned Mamata Banerjee's claims of an attack. In the whole debate, the sight of the Chief Minister leading a \"padyatra\" in a wheelchair makes a compelling point.\n\n\"Khela Hobe (game on)\" - as she says in her speeches these days.\n\nDidi and her antics have always been standout, riveting, and hard to ignore.\n\nShe made sure of it when she was part of the BJP-led NDA government and the Congress-led UPA government at the centre.

She first contested elections in 1984.\n\nIn 1997, she quit the Congress and floated her Trinamool Congress. It took her 14 years to get where she wanted - the Chief Minister's office in Kolkata's Writers' Building. Over the years, she has been known to be one of India's most capricious politicians.\n\nShe likes to paint and write poetry. Her doodling is compulsive - she's at it even through meetings - and the party's symbol is an example of her art.\n\nShe is the published author of 'Poribortan' (Change), 'Kobita' (Poems) and 'My Unforgettable Memories'.\n\nShe lives a simple life; she has forever been seen in cotton saris and rubber slippers."}

The petition said that the Law Commission had proposed this in 1999. The Supreme Court in 2013 upheld the right of voters to reject all candidates contesting the election in a constituency, saying it would go a long way in cleansing the political system.\n\nIn the 2019 general election, NOTA secured over 6.5 lakh votes, which was 1.06 per cent of the overall vote share. Of the 36 political parties, whose representatives were elected to the 17th Lok Sabha, 15 got fewer votes than NOTA. Many of these parties contested only a handful of seats.\n\nInitially, the bench of Chief Justice Sharad A Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian was today reluctant to hear the PIL filed by one Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay, represented by Senior Advocate Maneka Guruswamy. The petition says the right to reject will check corruption and stop political parties from choosing candidates in an autocratic manner.\n\n\"The right to reject and elect a new candidate will give power to the people to express their discontent. If voters are dissatisfied with the background or performance of the contesting candidate, they will opt for NOTA to reject such candidate and elect a new candidate,\" the petition said.\n\nIt also sought a direction to the Election Commission to restrict those candidates and political parties, whose election has been nullified, from taking part in the fresh polls.\n\nChief Justice Bobde said, \"It is a constitutional problem. If your argument is accepted...(if) all candidates are rejected, then nobody can become MP and the constituency goes unrepresented. If there is sufficient number of constituencies in which NOTA has prevailed, then many constituencies will go unrepresented. Then how will you constitute the Parliament?\"\n\n\n\nThe petitioner argued that if 99 per cent of the constituents vote for NOTA and one vote goes the other way, then that one vote will decide the election. Mr Upadhyay said that despite several representations, the concerned authorities had no responded to him on the matter.\n\nThe Chief Justice then said that if a political party has sufficient influence over voters, it can then manage to get candidates rejected in many constituencies using the NOTA rule implied by the petitioner and seats won't get filled and Parliament won't be constituted properly.\n\n\"Your answer is 'if a constituency goes unrepresented because all candidates rejected, then there should be fresh polls'?\" the court asked.\n\nThe petitioner denied this saying the \"right to reject\" will inspire political parties. The Chief Justice finally accepted the petition and issued the notices."}

{"source": "NDTV", "headline": "How Do You Take 1.3 Billion People To The Bank?", "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/how-do-you-take-1-3-billion-people-to-the-bank-2390936", "content": "In the futurist law now named after him, the late Stanford University computer scientist Roy Amara once declared, \"We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.\" India's public digital infrastructure - in many ways, an immense online bureaucracy - is an outlier to this principle. The effort was written-off in the short run, but, less than a decade after it was introduced, it has mobilized technology at the grass-roots, tapping into the country's huge domestic potential. India is now ready to share its experience with the developing world.\n\nThe system - built on a unique 12-digit identification code for each Indian resident - has significantly improved financial inclusion, access to public documents and services, tax compliance, retail payments and the management of government subsidies. The key has been the Aadhaar card - the national identity document. Aadhaar was launched in 2009 by the government of then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. To run the program, he roped in Nandan Nilekani, a veteran of Infosys, the country's homegrown technology giant. It was an ambitious attempt to reach and electronically organize the more than 1.3-billion people living in India's sprawling, varied and sometimes inaccessible territory.\n\nWhile questions were raised about privacy issues, Aadhaar was cleared by the Indian Supreme Court for opt-in use in September 2018; a larger bench of judges affirmed the decision in January 2021. Today, most of India has chosen to join the biometric data system: there are 1.26 billion people officially registered in Aadhaar.\n\nUPI allows peer-to-peer and consumer-to-merchant transactions through mobile apps.\n\nWhile it began with the Manmohan Singh government, Aadhaar became the backbone of the India's public digital infrastructure in 2014 when Prime Minister Narendra Modi combined it with his government's Jan Dhan initiative, a financial inclusion program for India's huge number of unbanked households. These new accounts were linked to both mobile numbers and Aadhaar, creating the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile, or JAM. Today more than 80% of all Indians have a bank account, up from half that level when the program started.\n\nThe digital network is now the lynchpin for most of India's social security and cash transfer programs - which had been notorious for corruption and unreliability. Today, the government uses JAM's direct benefit transfers for 317 programs. It made 2.6 billion transactions in the current financial year, getting more than $46 billion to beneficiaries. The cumulative value of the transfers since the first programs started in 2013 stands at more than $195 billion.\n\nThe four big successes of India's public digital infrastructure have been Unified Payments Interface (UPI), Bharat QR, Bharat Bill Pay System (BBPS) and the RuPay card - which work with all or parts of the digital network's threefold components of banking, secure identity and mobility.\n\nUPI allows peer-to-peer and consumer-to-merchant transactions through mobile apps and e-commerce platforms, with JAM providing identification for money transfers. It registers 2-billion transactions a month and, in just about four years, is now in use from the largest departmental stores to roadside trinket shops.\n\nBharat QR allows consumers to scan the graphic codes to transfer money without sharing phone numbers. This system performs 250 million transactions a month.\n\nGoing live in 2018, BBPS allows Indian consumers to pay bills for practically everything online and via UPI apps - utilities, school fees, insurance premiums and loans.\n\nLaunched in 2012, RuPay cards were meant to rival Visa and Mastercard. Already, more than 600-million cards have been issued, chiefly on Jan Dhan accounts. RuPay has a 30% market share in point of sale transactions and 25% in online transactions. India is working with nine countries to ensure RuPay cards are integrated with local payment systems - including, Australia, Bahrain, Bhutan, Maldives, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and South Korea.\n\nIndeed, other countries with the same logistical challenges and demographic needs as India may be tempted to adopt much of the digital network. In 2018, Bill Gates, technology stalwart, backed Aadhaar and praised Modi for fully embracing the scheme. In its March 2019 report \"Digital India,\" McKinsey Global Institute observed that \"the public sector has been one strong catalyst for India's rapid digitization. The government's efforts to ramp up Aadhaar has played a major role.\" Exporting India's public digital infrastructure would increase the country's influence on a massive scale even as it improves quality of life of millions globally.\n\nIn fact, the digital infrastructure has only grown and adapted with the Covid-19 crisis. Two apps, the JAM-linked vaccination monitor CoWin and the contact tracer Aarogya Setu, were integral to India's battle against the coronavirus. The Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network is a smartphone-based supply chain platform developed connecting 27,000 vaccine storage centers supported by 50,000 cold chain handlers. It deals primarily with maternal care and infant inoculation; each year it has to manage the needs of 27 million newborns.\n\nBridging the digital divide is the best way to overcome socio-economic differences.

The platform lets the armed forces practice responding to missile warning scenarios and collaborate in cyberspace.\n\nThey're not exactly rehearsing how to destroy alien spaceships. But if satellite solar panels need to be fixed, they can practice doing that - without having to travel to space to do it. If a spacecraft needs to be repositioned, they can execute that too. If troops need more information about a mission, it's as simple as pressing a button. No space suits or textbooks necessary.\n\nThe branch's main purpose is to improve national-security capabilities in space, according to the Pentagon. More directly, Space Force's job is to maintain, protect and expand the U.S. fleet of advanced military satellites.\n\nThe contract with SAIC was established to create a virtual replica of space stations, mission control rooms and satellites, which can be difficult or costly to get to. That way, the space agency can streamline operations and train teams on what to expect before being launched on a mission.\n\n\"Sometimes you go to these demos, and it's just some nondescript room, but it doesn't really look like your (real world) environment,\" said John Lynch, program director for SAIC, who manages the firm's contract with the Space and Missile Systems Center. \"We wanted the experience (to feel) like you were actually there.\"\n\nTypically, experiential training requires custom simulators that could cost millions of dollars to build. The contractor worked to bring costs down by developing a cloud-based platform that can be updated over-the-air and deployed on a mass scale.\n\nThe outcome is a video game-like experience accessible on Facebook's Oculus Quest headsets.\n\nEssentially, they're in cyberspace with colleagues where they role playas if they were at international space stations and mission control centers.\n\nThe simulation experience is pretty straightforward. Space Force troops, which have officially been dubbed \"Guardians,\" can choose from predesigned avatars before being launched into a virtual lobby where they wait for up to seven others to join in.\n\nInstructors or field experts can digitally lead them into the satellite simulation to teleport around the satellite, chat with other troops, pull levers and press buttons as if they were on an actual worksite. They can open the satellite's front to examine its internal mechanics and press information icons for greater context.\n\nUp close, the digitized satellite is detailed, with 3-D solar panels, antennas and visible nuts and bolts. It's modeled after a missile warning spacecraft that's part of the agency's Space Based Infrared System constellation.\n\nToggles on gaming controllers allow users to pick items up, draw images in midair and use laser pointers to spotlight specific areas on the satellite or elsewhere in the room.\n\nOculus Quest headsets retail for $299 and are cheaper to buy and send out than immersive alternatives. VR competitors such as the HTC Vive retail for $499 and require high-powered gaming laptops to run. The Oculus Quest is a stand-alone unit, with no cords attached, making it more appealing for exploration scenarios, according to Scott Hungerford, game development specialty manager at SAIC.\n\nThe company says it didn't have a deal with Facebook when it bought the headsets last spring.\n\nThe satellite training platform is one of the latest projects from SAIC, a $7.1 billion technology support company based in Reston, Va. The Army awarded the firm an $830 million contract in February to provide engineering, software and simulation for the Department of Defense.\n\nThe Space Force is the sixth branch of the U.S. military and the first new military service since the Air Force's creation in 1947. The force relies on SAIC to modernize satellite ground systems at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico and Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado.\n\nMoving forward, SAIC plans to bolster the platform with tools such as magnifying glasses so that officers can take a closer look at satellite parts. The contractor is also looking toward augmented reality experiences, where users can train using real-world screens wrapped in virtual environments.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}

Greg Abbott's decision to drop mask mandates - and to let businesses operate at full capacity - leaves store owners to make and enforce their own rules. Texas and other states are moving to swiftly reopen their economies and end restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Millions of people have been vaccinated, but with virus variants spreading and most Americans still awaiting their shots, health officials say it's far too early to ditch face coverings.\n\nThursday's struggle at the bank underscored the challenges of maintaining mask requirements - though Wright said in an interview that she has never covered her face inside stores, statewide orders or not. Galveston police say they have issued a warrant for the 65-year-old's arrest on allegations of trespass and resisting arrest.\n\nWright said she was \"attacked,\" described her belief in a \"Plandemic\" - a reference to a widely shared, misinformation-filled video - and compared mask requirements to the way that Nazi Germany forced Jewish people to identify themselves with a Star of David.\n\nShe said she has no regrets and that people \"can't cancel me, I'm retired.\" She maintained that the law is on her side and told The Washington Post that she plans to call police on Monday. She said she is in a Hitchcock, Texas, RV park across the bay from Galveston.\n\n\"I feel like I took one for the team, because people need to wake up,\" she said, decrying mask mandates.\n\nPolice said Wright \"sustained minor injuries\" and was taken to University of Texas Medical Branch Health in Galveston. Wright said it was more serious: She showed a Post reporter a boot on her foot and papers from a Thursday visit to UTMB describing multiple fractures.\n\nThe bank did not comment on the incident beyond providing information on its mask policy.\n\n\"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical experts continue to reinforce the importance of using face coverings and practicing physical distancing in all public spaces,\" said spokeswoman Carla Molina, explaining that customers who are uncomfortable or unable to wear a mask can use ATMs or drive-through windows rather than enter their offices.\n\nBody camera footage released by Galveston police shows an officer walking into the bank and conferring with a woman using a blue surgical mask. The woman points toward Wright, saying quietly, \"She's right over here.\"\n\nThe officer finds Wright in line and without a mask. \"Ma'am ... if they ask you to leave, you have to leave,\" he said.\n\n\"My money's in this bank, and I'm going to take it out,\" Wright replied.\n\n\"Well then you have to abide by the rules,\" the officer responded, saying the bank had a \"right to refuse service.\" Not swayed, Wright said she had been waiting for about 10 minutes.\n\n\"Ma'am, listen,\" the officer said. \"We're going to do this the easy way or the hard way.\"\n\nMore arguing follows, with Wright eventually walking away and the officer following.\n\n\"Do not touch me!\" she says. \"Who do you think you are?\" The officer tries to handcuff her and forces her toward the floor, ordering her to put her hands behind her back.\n\n\"I hope someone's filming this,\" she says at one point. Eventually she gets up and is escorted out. \"I think you broke my freaking foot!\" she says, and the officer calls for help as he leads her to a car.\n\nWright told The Post that she called police after leaving the hospital Thursday evening. A photo of her call log appeared to corroborate that.\n\nBut Wright said that when she asked \"what my next step is,\" a police sergeant whose name she did not recall told her, \"none of my officers arrested you that day.\"\n\nGalveston police spokeswoman Stacy Papillion said Saturday that she could not speak to how Wright left the hospital or her account of calling police afterward. She said Wright was taken into custody and was set to be arrested but was then immediately taken to the hospital after complaining of foot pain.\n\n\"She will be arrested on the warrant,\" Papillion said. Authorities around Texas have emphasized that, despite the absence of a statewide mask mandate, people can still face arrest for trespass if they flout a business's rules.\n\nMasks remain required in limited situations: The Texas Education Agency, for example, said after the governor's orders that schools should keep mandating masks. And some local officials have defied the governor's orders to stop enforcing broader restrictions.\n\n\"We're not going to rescind anything,\" Austin Mayor Steve Adler said on CNN. \"We told our community that we would always be guided by the data and the doctors, and we're going to continue that.\"\n\nA judge on Friday refused to give the state an injunction in its legal battle with the city and the surrounding county, paving the way for a local mask mandate to remain awhile longer.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}

The palace brought in an independent law firm to investigate the allegations against the Duchess.\n\nOn the contrary, the former ''Suits'' star has demanded evidence to know precisely who is calling her a bully.\n\nFox News reported that the Duchess wants to see all documents, emails, and text messages related to the bullying probe which began against her by the Queen. Meanwhile, both sides of the bullying row appear to be lawyering up.\n\nOn the other hand, the former law aides of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have agreed to help them with the probe ordered up last week by the queen.\n\nAccording to the probe reported by Fox News, the mother of one has been accused of creating a toxic work environment and allegedly reducing staffers to tears when she lived at Kensington Palace after marrying Prince Harry in May 2018.\n\nBuckingham Palace at first said it was dispatching its own examination concerning the Duchess; however, it now seems that the palace is keen on encouraging in any event of an independent probe.\n\nMeghan and Harry's CBS special with Oprah marked the couple''s first joint interview since their royal exit, which was recently made permanent.

(FILE)\n\nSiding with farmers protesting the Centre's new agriculture laws, Meghalaya Governor Satya Pal Malik here on Sunday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah not to offend them.\n\nSpeaking at an event in his home district, Malik said if the Centre gives legal guarantee of the minimum support price (MSP) for crops, farmers will relent.\n\nThe Meghalaya Governor also claimed that he prevented the arrest of farmer leader Rakesh Tikait when he heard rumours about it.\n\nMalik further said he had requested the prime minister and the home minister not to use force against farmers, and not to send them home from Delhi empty-handed.\n\n\"None of the laws are in favour of farmers. The country in which farmers and soldiers are not satisfied, that country cannot move ahead. That country cannot be saved. Hence, the Army and farmers should be kept satisfied,\" Malik said urging PM Modi and Home Minister Shah not to offend them.\n\nDescribing the condition of farmers as bad, Malik said, \"They are getting poorer day by day while the salary of government officials and staff increases after every three years. Whatever is sown by a farmer is cheap and whatever he buys is expensive.\"\n\n\"They do not know how they are becoming poor. The 'satyanaash' (annihilation) of the farmers is taking place without their knowledge. When they go to sow (crops), there is some price, and when they go to reap it, the price decreases by almost Rs 300,\" Malik said.\n\nTaking a jibe at the arguments offered in favour of the new farm laws, Malik said, \"A lot of noise was created that farmers can now sell (crops) at any place. This is a 15-year-old law. Despite this, when a farmer from Mathura goes to Palwal with wheat, there is a lathicharge on him. When a farmer from Sonipat comes to Narela, there is a lathicharge on him.\"\n\n\"There are many questions of farmers, which must be answered. Today, there is no law in favour of farmers. This has to be corrected. I want to assure you that in the matter of farmers, I will go to any extent to solve their problems,\" he said.\n\nApparently referring to Sikh farmers protesting against the laws, Malik said, \"The Sikh community does not back down and forget things even after 300 years.\"\n\n\"Indira Gandhi (ex-PM) had got the 'Mahamrityunjay Mantra Jaap' done for a month after the Operation Blue Star. Arun Nehru told me that when he asked her that you do not believe is such rituals, then why are you performing these, she said you don't know, I have damaged their 'Akal Takht'. They will not spare me.\"\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}
