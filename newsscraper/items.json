We are a country which produces the best IT minds. We cannot make an app to deal with this situation? We are wasting 44 lakh vaccines out of 10 crore we have given to states. This is only bad planning. What else is it? Why should you not have this covered? You should have known that there would be a situation that people may not turn up, because if a person turns up and you have to open a new vial, you will not tell him to come tomorrow\u2026 You have to foresee this situation. This is not rocket science,\u201d said the court.\n\nThe court was hearing a case related to the Covid-19 situation in Delhi.\n\n\u201cOnce a vial is opened, it has to be either fully consumed or the remainder goes waste. It should be possible for governments to devise ways and means so as to register volunteers who may be below the age of 45 and above the age of 18 years, who could be called to take the vaccine in case there are doses left unutilised after say 5 pm on each day. That would ensure all the doses are fully utilised and not wasted,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cDoctors and experts have been saying vaccinate yesterday; not today, not tomorrow. It does not matter whether it is Mr A or Mr B. Whomsoever you can vaccinate, please vaccinate. Whether he is 16 years, 20 years or 60 years doesn\u2019t matter. All need vaccination. Please look at this aspect,\u201d said the court.\n\nIt said the government should make necessary modifications to the CoWIN app in this regard, and observed that flexibility in vaccination eligibility was available in other countries like the US. \u201cIn our view, the wastage of even a single vaccine, when the same is proving to be life-saving, is a criminal waste,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cJust look at the amount of wastage. It is a huge waste. Every day, we are losing lives, young lives. The pandemic is hitting the young people very hard. Why should we waste even one shot,\u201d the court said. It also expressed concern over reports of a dip in vaccinations.\n\nSeeking an immediate ban on the industrial use of oxygen, the court said: \u201cThe need for oxygen is now. Any delay in this regard could lead to loss of precious lives. We, therefore, direct the central government to implement the said decision forthwith and make available oxygen to hospitals which are running out\u2026 lest there is grave loss of lives.\u201d\n\nOn petroleum refineries and steel plants being exempted, the court asked the Centre to \u201cseriously consider issuing appropriate orders\u201d\u2026 \u201cso that a fine balance can be struck between the needs of the people at large, who are suffering from Covid\u2026 and the needs of industry\u201d.\n\nTaking note of reports on shortage and hoarding of critical medicines for Covid-19 patients, it directed the Centre and the Drugs Controller General of India to issue necessary directions.\n\nOn reports of unfair distribution of Remdesivir to states, the court said: \u201cSomebody sitting in the government who is deciding how much is to go where, we assume he is applying his mind to the needs of that area\u2026 what is the seriousness of the situation\u2026 Otherwise, people will have blood on their hands if, despite having the medication, you are sending it to region A and not region B even though region B requires it more than region A.. then that is a very bad situation, then we are doomed.\u201d\n\nThe court said the Centre should review the distribution of Remdesivir to states on the basis of need. On reports of shortage of other drugs, it directed the Centre to interact with manufacturers, patent holders and licencees to ramp up production."}

But the biggest tech advancements could well be how the M1 processor from Apple now literally powers both a desktop and a tablet as well as everything in between.\n\nBy taking its M1 chip into both sides of the MacBook\u2019s spectrum, Apple has underlined its confidence on its silicon and showcased the versatility of what is the new chip on the block. So far no other company has really done this. So it remains to be see who this changes the industry in the long run. It is no longer about horses for courses, its about one horse that run wherever you want it to.\n\nApple event | Here is everything that was announced\n\nThere is a lot of messaging in this strategy. Apple is saying that the iPad Pro is as powerful as the iMac or the MacBook and you are basically choosing a form factor for just that, the form factor. It does not matter that the iPad Pro is a tablet and the iMac one of the most powerful computers you can buy. The M1 will take both to the next level.\n\nOver the past few years, Apple has been highlighting how the iPad Pro is as powerful or even more capable than most laptops. Today it has left little to imagination.\n\nYes, the iMac will have better thermal design because of its size, letting it do some extra stuff like processing multiple 4K HRD streams. And you will pic a device with a fan, like the iMac, for just that. But inside the iPad Pro too the capabilities will be the same.\n\nThey will both push the envelope in their own ways. So while the iMac can edit 8K video without a single frame drop, the iPad Pro will be able to help developers to code apps to create features never before seen in a device you could hold in your hand.\n\nThis is also leaving behind a lot of the competition. Apple is telling rivals in the computing space that its devices are way ahead of what they can offer, wherever the form factor it might have to offer. Given that Apple\u2019s devices now run on an exclusive processor, it will be hard for other manufacturers, dependent on third-party chips, to offer the same versatility right away.\n\nFor that, a Samsung might have to come up with its own silicon for computing devices. Till that happens, Apple is going to be a rack above the rest."}

The state government also informed the Court that there are 188 active Covid-19 cases in the prisons at present.\n\nThe Court, while raising concerns over surge in Covid-19 spread in prisons, sought to know from the state government as to whether RT-PCR test of accused persons can be conducted prior to admitting in prison along with their vaccination ( in case of age above 45 years) and also asked if the undertrials can be produced before the court through videoconferencing\n\nA division bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice Girish S Kulkarni was hearing suo motu (on its own) PIL initiated by HC last week based on news reports highlighting alarming rise in Covid-19 cases in the last two months in the prisons across Maharashtra.\n\nThe court had asked the state government prison authorities to produce by the next hearing details of the Covid-19 status of prison staff and inmates, and measures taken or proposed to be taken to control the Covid-19 spread and decongest jails.\n\nOn Tuesday, Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted an affidavit filed by Dr. Chhering Dorje, Special Inspector General of Police (Prisons).\n\nKumbhakoni told the Court that even though the jail authorities are taking steps towards implementation of a decision by the High-Powered Committee (HPC) constituted last year, \u2018for reasons and grounds beyond the control of prison authorities,\u2019 the inmates from some prisons have been infected with Covid.\n\n\u201cThis is principally because various lower (trial) Courts throughout the State have been refusing to release prisoners on bail, temporary bail, etc. in view of the facts and circumstances of the respective cases,\u201d the affidavit said.\n\nThe affidavit further stated that \u2018fresh exercise\u2019 is required to be undertaken to explore the possibility of newly admitted prisoners to be released as per HPC directions and the same will result into decongestion of the jails, at least to \u2018sizable extent.\u2019\n\nKumbhakoni informed the Court that the prison authorities have approached various departments of the state government with proposals for creating new jails to permanently increase the capacity in prisons. He said that six such proposals are actively being concerned by the authorities and sought appropriate directions to them for speedy consideration of proposals in current situation.\n\nIn light of this, HC said, \u201cIt is, therefore, high time that the appropriate department of the Government looks into the proposals as early as possible and conveys the green signal for setting up new prisons considering the fact that the present setup is woefully short of the requirements. It is ordered accordingly.\n\nHe also submitted that last year, the state government had created 36 \u2018temporary prisons\u2019 in the premises of educational institutions and hostels and they had to be given back for educational activities. However, with the ongoing covid outbreak and as institutions have stopped their activities, the prison authorities started reclaiming these premises to convert them into temporary prisons and 14 such institutions have already been reclaimed, he said.\n\nKumbhakoni further submitted that nearly 8 prison staff members across 7 prisons died due to Covid. \u201cWe had very good control at one point of time. Meantime, we got relaxed, I must concede. Now we are back to taking strict measures to contain the spread.\u201d He also said that a vaccination programme was already underway for eligible prisoners as per guidelines issued by the Central authorities.\n\nThe bench said that while the jail staff could be carrying the infection inside the prisons as the inmates are not going outside and the same should be looked into.\n\nWhile perusing the state affidavit, the Court noted that Yerawada central prison was \u2018most populated\u2019 with a current inmate population of 6170, despite having a capacity of housing nearly 2449 prisoners and said that the decongestion at such jails requires to be considered.\n\nThe bench also asked the state to provide details about crime rate and number of persons arrested for various offences after April 13 \u2018break the chain\u2019 circular of the state government and inform whether there was any drop in the crime rate compared to the first twelve days of April, 2021. The bench also sought to know if a large number of inmates could be granted emergency parole to decongest prisons.\n\nThe bench then asked the state government if the inmates can be transferred to open prisons having dwindling populations as suggested by the Aurangabad bench of HC earlier this month.\n\nIt also sought suggestions from the People\u2019s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) and senior counsel Mihir Desai, who had petitioned HC last year on similar issue and their plea was disposed of with slew of guidelines issued by the Court.\n\nSeeking responses and suggestions from the parties to the case, HC posted further hearing on PIL to Thursday, April 22."}

Now the BCA\u2019s other faction, led by its secretary, has announced dates for the Bihar Premier League (BPL), starting from June 12 in Patna.\n\nThey have sought permission from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to run a franchise-based tournament. The BCCI, however, says it will only allow a non-franchise tournament without private individuals as owners.\n\nBCA has two groups within their Apex Council. The group headed by BCA president Rakesh Tiwary and a group headed by BCA secretary Sanjay Kumar.\n\nLast month, Tiwary\u2019s faction had hosted the BCL despite BCCI emailing them to stop their league after the tournament began.\n\nNow, the other faction headed by BCA\u2019s secretary Kumar wants the BCCI to give a green signal for the BPL.\n\n\u201cWe have written to BCCI to grant permission to hold BPL. It will be hosted by BCA and will be a franchise-based T20 league. If everything goes well, we will have a franchise auction and then a player auction in May,\u201d BCA secretary Kumar told The Indian Express.\n\nAs per Kumar, the BCA during the tenure of Supreme Court nominated Committee of Administrators (COA) had sought approval to host its T20 league. He claims the COA had notified them about guidelines set by Indian board, where only local players can take part in the league.\n\nHowever, the BCCI is likely to suspend the state unit if it goes ahead with the franchise-based model.\n\n\u201cWe will reply to their mail. If they want to run a cricket tournament without a franchise model, the BCCI has no problem but if not, the BCCI will not permit them. If they do it again the board will suspend them,\u201d a BCCI official said.\n\nThe BCCI had earlier sought legal opinion on the BCA going ahead with the Bihar Cricket League and demanded a compliance certificate to check if all norms set by Lodha Committee\u2019s recommendation had been followed.\n\nWhen contacted BCA president Tiwary, from the faction that hosted the BCL, said the new proposed tournament of the rival faction had nothing to with BCA and no player of the BCA can take part in it.\n\n\u201cSanjay (the rival faction\u2019s secretary) has been expelled from BCA. He cannot host any tournament under the BCA banner and any player registered with BCA will not take part in the league,\u201d Tiwary stated.\n\nIn response, Kumar stated that for BCA, Tiwary is no longer the president.\n\n\u201cNone of the office bearers were with him during his BCL. For us he is not president of BCA. Let BCCI decide on our request,\u201d Kumar told this newspaper.\n\nA few months ago, BCA president Tiwary had expelled its secretary Kumar in their Apex Council meeting. However, soon, Kumar with support of its district members removed Tiwary as it\u2019s president. The matter is in court and BCCI has informed BCA that until the court gives a verdict, the BCA president and secretary will continue in their respective posts."}

Bharat Biotech is able to expand Covaxin manufacturing capacity in a short timeline mainly due to the availability of new specially designed BSL-3 facilities, a first-of-its-kind for manufacturing in India, which has been repurposed, and preexisting expertise and knowhow to manufacture, test and release highly purified inactivated viral vaccines.\n\nManufacturing partnerships are being explored with partners in other countries, who have prior expertise with commercial scale manufacture of inactivated viral vaccines under biosafety containment, the statement added.\n\nBharat Biotech uses a proprietary adjuvant Algel-IMDG, which has now proven to be a safe and effective adjuvant, especially to stimulate memory T cell responses. The synthesis and manufacture of the IMDG component has been successfully indigenised and will be manufactured at commercial scale within the country. This is the first instance where a novel adjuvant has been commercialised in India, the statement said."}

Delhi will not go out of oxygen,\u201d sources said.\n\nData shared by deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia shows that in most of the hospitals- state-run and private \u2013 the oxygen supply is available for 8-10 hours. \u201cIn most hospitals in Delhi, oxygen is available for the next 8 to 12 hours only. We have been demanding for one week to increase the oxygen supply quota to Delhi, which the central government has to do. If oxygen does not reach the hospitals in sufficient quantity by tomorrow morning, there will be an outcry,\u201d tweeted Sisodia.\n\n<p \u201cwidth=420\u2033 lang=\u201dhi\u201d dir=\u201dltr\u201d>\u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0905\u0927\u093f\u0915\u0924\u0930 \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u0947\u0935\u0932 \u0905\u0917\u0932\u0947 8 \u0938\u0947 12 \u0918\u0902\u091f\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0939\u0940 \u0911\u0915\u094d\u0938\u093f\u091c\u0928 \u0909\u092a\u0932\u092c\u094d\u0927 \u0939\u0948. \u0939\u092e \u090f\u0915 \u0939\u092b\u093c\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0926\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0911\u0915\u094d\u0938\u093f\u091c\u0928 \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0915\u094b\u091f\u093e \u092c\u0922\u093c\u093e\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0901\u0917 \u0915\u0930 \u0930\u0939\u0947 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u091c\u094b\u0915\u093f \u0915\u0947\u0902\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0938\u0930\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u0915\u094b \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u0939\u0948 . \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u0915\u0932 \u0938\u0941\u092c\u0939 \u0924\u0915 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0905\u0938\u094d\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0911\u0915\u094d\u0938\u093f\u091c\u0928 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u092a\u0939\u0941\u0901\u091a\u0940 \u0924\u094b \u0939\u093e\u0939\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u092e\u091a \u091c\u093e\u090f\u0917\u093e. pic.twitter.com/omO7RCTaCj\u2014 Manish Sisodia (@msisodia) April 20, 2021\n\nWith a massive rise in the daily number of Covid cases, hospitals in the city have been raising alarms about the depleting oxygen supply. Dr DS Rana, chairman of board at Sir Ganga Ram hospital told The Indian Express, \u201cWe have 500 Covid patients in the hospital out of which 128 are in the ICU. The oxygen requirement for the patients in the ICU is relatively higher than those admitted in the general wards. If we continue with the current situation, the existing oxygen supply will last for only seven-eight hours. Normally, we require 3,000 cubic meter of oxygen in a day and currently, the demand has gone up to approximately 10,000 cubic meter. I have been working with the hospital for the last 40 years and this is the first time that we have seen such a crisis.\u201d\n\nThe bed occupancy in the hospitals at the moment is 86 per cent. However, the critical care facilities are filling up fast. As per the Delhi government\u2019s Corona App, there are only 30 ICU beds available at the moment."}

The additional burden of purchasing vaccines will place considerable strain on state finances,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nThe union government had stated that 50 per cent of the vaccine doses are to be earmarked for the central government, and the balance 50 per cent is to be distributed to state governments and in the open market.\n\nVijayan said the states have Constitutional obligation in the health sector and do need an assured quota of vaccines which has to be provided free in the pandemic situation. It is imperative that vaccines are to be provided free of cost to the states.\n\nHe said though the policy states that the central government would provide vaccine free of cost to the state governments from the 50 per cent of the quota based on the criteria, the states require a reassurance that they would not be left to compete with open market players.\n\nHe said open market distributors may be permitted to have a specified quota of the vaccines, for which affordable price has to be fixed so that unscrupulous players do not exploit the public.\n\nVijayan also urged the Prime Minister to allot Kerala 50 lakh doses of vaccines for implementing the state\u2019s mega vaccination plan."}

(Image Source: Caviar)\n\nCaviar is a luxury brand that is known for its special limited edition smartphones, consoles, accessories and other devices which are expertly crafted and created in limited quantities. Unsurprisingly Caviar products are often sold at very high prices, which make them more of a collector\u2019s item than daily-driver tech.\n\nCelebrating the 60th anniversary of the first-ever manned spaceflight back in 1961, Caviar has now launched a new limited edition \u201cSpace Conquerors\u201d line of customised Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max devices. The new lineup features a unique variant stylised after past and present space exploration icons like Yuri Gagarin, Neil Armstrong, Sergei Korolev, Jeff Bezos and even Tesla founder Elon Musk.\n\nHere\u2019s a detailed insight on each of the four Space Conqueror edition smartphones, along with their \u2018other-worldly\u2019 prices. We\u2019ll be focussing on the design elements and overlooking the specifications of the phone which will be the same across all the iPhone 12 Pro Max variants.\n\nGagarin Edition\n\nThe iPhone 12 Pro Max Gagarin edition is crafted out of aviation-grade titanium and has a 3D miniature-sized Vostok-K rocket, the same rocket that brought Yuri Gagarin to orbit. The phone also has a navigator\u2019s watch engraved on the back.\n\nThis is identical to the watch that Gagarin used to track his 108 minutes in space. A piece of the Vostok-1 capsule is also embedded in the phone. The Gagarin edition will only be available in 12 units and will be priced starting at $8,920 (about Rs 6,69,808).\n\nArmstrong Edition\n\nThe second Armstrong edition iPhone 12 Pro Max celebrates the Apollo 11, the first craft to land on the Moon. Honouring Armstrong, the back of the phone features a depiction of the astronaut placing the iconic American flag on the lunar surface.\n\nThe Armstrong edition will also come with a fragment of the Apollo 11 spacecraft embedded on the phone. The device will be available in only 11 units with prices starting at $6,450 (about Rs 4,84,334).\n\nThe iPhone 12 Pro Max Gagarin and Armstrong editions.

Korolev was also involved with the development of Sputnik, the world\u2019s first artificial satellite that was launched in 1957.\n\nThe phone features a hardened titanium case which is double electroplated with 999 gold. On the outer surface of the phone is an October 4, 1957 engraving that symbolises the Sputnik launch. The Korolev edition will only be available in 99 units, with prices starting at $6,760 (about Rs 5,07,625).\n\nMusk Edition\n\nThe custom iPhone 12 Pro Max Musk edition phone takes Mars as its inspiration, which is the target for SpaceX, Musk\u2019s own aerospace manufacturing and space transportation company. The phone also features a silhouette of Elon Musk and sports pieces of the CRS-14 Falcon 9 rocket as well as the CRS-17 Dragon spacecraft, both of which were involved in delivering supplies to the Internation Space Station.\n\nThe Musk Edition will only be made available in 19 special edition units, one for each year since SpaceX was founded. The price of the Musk edition will start at $6,610 (about Rs 4,96,329).\n\nThe iPhone 12 Pro Max Korolev, Musk and Bezos editions.

The feather on the design is engraved with the date April 29, 2015, when the company\u2019s New Shepard reusable rocket flew for the first time.

(File Photo)\n\nWritten by Aditya Gujarathi\n\nThe National Human Rights Commission is supposed to be the guardian of human rights in the country. While various experts have already lamented how the NHRC is a toothless body, it still has various powers in holding state authorities accountable. As the topmost human rights body in the country, its staff is expected to have the legal acumen to tackle the systemic human rights abuses whilst also understanding how marginalisation and oppression works. In this article, I will write about how incorrect interpretation of law by this quasi-judicial body is leading to in limine dismissals (rejection of applications at the threshold) of valid applications of human rights abuse.\n\nThis author was involved in drafting an application to the NHRC which was dismissed in limine under Regulation 9(xi) of the NHRC (Procedure) Regulations 1997. This regulation states that the NHRC can dismiss an application in limine if the case is \u201csub-judice before a Commission/ Court/ Tribunal\u201d.\n\nThis application was regarding unjust investigation, and police brutality against a lawyer in Gujarat, who was a social justice and human rights advocate, and is known in the bar for the same. She was allegedly framed in a case of forgery and criminal conspiracy under various sections of IPC. Curiously, she was not even mentioned in the FIR. Despite this fact, the police produced her before the magistrate after almost 68 hours of her detention, in violation of her fundamental right under Article 22(2) of the Constitution. Her bail was rejected first by the magistrate and then by the sessions court during peak Covid-19 time, violating basic principles of bail as prima facie mitigating circumstances existed. The High Court then had to step in to grant her bail stating that the case against her was based on surmises, conjecture and presumptions. The chargesheet was filed two months after the application was filed with the NHRC.\n\nThe NHRC dismissed the application in limine, not once but twice citing Regulation 9(xi), stating that the case was sub-judice. The fact of the matter is that this interpretation of the NHRC is not just flawed but prima facie legally wrong. What is even more concerning is that we don\u2019t know how many legitimate cases have been rejected since 1997 due to wrong interpretation of this provision.\n\nSection 2(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code states that a \u201cjudicial proceeding includes any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or may be legally taken on oath\u201d. This definition is unchanged from the previous version of the code. This definition contains \u201cinquiry\u201d and \u201ctrial\u201d under its ambit and not investigation. Therefore, the stage of investigation cannot be equated to a judicial proceeding. This was also the view agreed upon by the Delhi High Court in RPS Panwar v Union of India. The court upheld the view of the administrative tribunal which had stated that mere registration of a case could not be treated as commencement of judicial proceedings.\n\nSimilarly, a Special Bench of the Patna High Court in Gopal Marwari & ors v. Emperor held that judicial proceedings are only set to commence after the magistrate decides to act on the report submitted by the police (chargesheet). Hence, any stage prior to the magistrate deciding to act on the chargesheet can\u2019t be stated to come under the ambit of judicial proceedings. Interpreting the definition of \u201cjudicial proceedings\u201d as stated in the CrpC, the Allahabad High Court in Sheo Raj v. State had stated that evidence cannot be legally taken on oath during an investigation. The court also held that even though the statement under section 164 of the CrPC is under oath, the statement is not in the nature of evidence and proceedings of recording this statement will not be considered as judicial proceedings according to the definition in the Code. Therefore, at no stage of an investigation, the proceedings shall be deemed to be judicial proceedings.\n\nThese interpretations by various courts, conclusively hold that mere filing of an FIR and the stage of investigation would not be considered as a judicial proceeding.\n\nThese legal arguments were communicated to the NHRC through three distinct letters addressed to the Registrar and the CEO of the NHRC. The commission clubbed the letters with the original applications filed and dismissed them in limine again, without addressing the larger issue communicated to them. This was after the entire argument and interpretation related to the pendency of proceedings in criminal matters was communicated in simple and sound legal language.\n\nTo understand the view of the NHRC better, we filed a Right to Information Application seeking the base document or legislation on the basis of which, a matter is concluded to be sub-judice under Regulation 9(xi). After not getting a satisfactory reply, we filed an appeal. The Appellate Authority, vide order dated 31/03/ 2021 stated that,\u201cAny matter which is pending for adjudication before a court of law is a sub-judice matter. Whenever a complainant makes a reference to a matter pending before the court of law for consideration, the same is considered to be subjudice and under Regulation 9(xi) of NHRC (procedure) Regulations, as amended in 1997, such a complaint is not ordinarily maintainable.\u201d\n\nThe NHRC did not refer to any legislation or common law principle which explains or defines what constitutes pendency of a judicial proceeding. Not going into the defective nature of the regulation itself, the fact that it is wrongly interpreted is worrisome. Furthermore, the NHRC (Procedure) Regulations, is a subordinate legislation and as such cannot go outside the ambit of the existing legislative framework governing the doctrine of sub-judice in criminal proceedings.\n\nWhat is of more serious concern is that this is a systemic issue in the NHRC. Of the 86,187 cases disposed of in 2016-17, 33,290 were dismissed in limine. That is an astonishing 38.6 per cent of all the cases disposed off. Of these, how many were dismissed due to erroneous interpretation of sub-judice is something worth investigating. Similarly in 2017-18, 42 per cent cases were dismissed in limine. These are staggering figures. When we tried to dig deeper into the cases that have been dismissed in limine, and asked the NHRC for the data of cases dismissed in limine for being sub-judice, they replied by stating, \u201cas such no data is maintained in the Commission.\u201d\n\nThere is no way of ascertaining how many cases have been dismissed in limine for the reason of the case being sub-judice. This sort of (non) accountability mechanism when an institution is dealing with serious human rights issues is nothing short of irresponsible.\n\nMost cases of police and state brutality, torture, filing of fraudulent FIRs takes place before the court takes cognisance of the matter, before it even becomes sub-judice (pending in a judicial proceeding). The nature of in limine dismissals by the NHRC is worrying, as there is no way of knowing how many people with genuine concerns have filed applications and have received rejections in the last 23 years on the basis of wrong interpretation of a straight-forward law by this quasi-judicial body.\n\nMy experience of the back and forth with the NHRC, and of multitude of people who face human rights abuses and have approached the NHRC has been about its pedantic government-office like approach to critical questions concerning human rights. The nature of the work involved in human rights commissions across the country begs the question of the sensitivity of their staff towards issues involving human rights and social justice. This brings out larger questions of not just their training, but worldview towards these issues. The letter highlighting the incorrect and erroneous interpretation of Regulation 9(xi) was highlighted to the CEO and Registrar of the NHRC. Yet, there does not appear to be a desire look into this systemic issue which has resulted in the NHRC turning a blind eye to innumerable human rights abuses.\n\n\u2013 The writer is a lawyer"}

And why can\u2019t budgeted and sanctioned positions be filled swiftly? The blame squarely lies with the judiciary for not reimagining its processes and procedures to build capacity.\n\nWritten by Prakhar Misra and Shreyas Narla\n\nLast month, the Supreme Court asked the government the status of the 55 recommendations on judicial appointments made a year ago. And, last week, the collegium met to appoint five Supreme Court judges but postponed the decision to a later date. These delays have further strained judicial capacity, especially in India\u2019s high courts. As reported, the Patna High Court is operating at 60.3 per cent of sanctioned strength, the Calcutta HC at 55 per cent, Rajasthan HC at 54 per cent, and the Madhya Pradesh HC at 52.8 per cent. Given the pendency rates, why isn\u2019t judicial capacity a priority? And why can\u2019t budgeted and sanctioned positions be filled swiftly? The blame squarely lies with the judiciary for not reimagining its processes and procedures to build capacity.\n\nFirst, while India needs more judges, how many are enough? The Supreme Court has implemented the weighted caseload method for subordinate courts \u2014 where disposal of cases is weighted by the nature, complexity of cases, local conditions and a performance evaluation system. For the higher judiciary, the process is opaque. In 2014, the Chief Justice of India had given an \u201cin principle\u201d agreement to increase the strength of the high courts by 25 per cent. A few states implemented this, which increased the total capacity to 1,080 sanctioned posts. But the precise method of calculating required capacity is unknown.\n\nSecond, the process of appointing judges is completely opaque and evolving. The reason is that appointments are no longer based on the constitutional provisions (Articles 124 and 217) or the 99th constitutional amendment setting up the NJAC, which was struck down by the apex court. In 2015, the Court ordered that an extra-constitutional document called the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) be put together to prescribe the manner in which the judicial collegium would pick the appointees. This document, however, remains unfinalised till date. Though several constitutional provisions allow the Supreme Court collegium to appoint ad-hoc judges and arrange for stop-gap measures, these options are seldom leveraged.\n\nFurther, even before the proposed MoP, the original collegium decisions since 1999 have never followed a specific procedure. The high courts are required to recommend names six months prior to an anticipated vacancy. However, High Courts have rarely initiated the proposals within this time-frame and there are instances of six-year delays in filling up vacancies. On the other hand, for the Supreme Court, there is no prescribed time-frame to begin appointment proceedings. Thus, on average, appointments to the Supreme Court take 41 days and appointments to the high courts take between 5-7 months.\n\nThird, the current appointment procedure is completely discretionary. Barring the qualifications specified in the Constitution \u2014 age, nationality, years of experience, etc. \u2014 there are no other notable criteria or requirements that must be met for someone to be considered a judge. Nor is there a list of those considered for the position and how the decision was made. Certainly, over time, unwritten criteria \u2014 seniority, geographic diversity, demographic qualities \u2014 have come to inform the appointment process for the Supreme Court. But, the last appointment to the Supreme Court was made in September 2019. Of the five vacant postings, the earliest one vacated in November 2019. Since then, no appointment has been made. With four more judges due to retire this year, it is unclear on what deliberations stop the collegium from making appointments.\n\nThe executive is also culpable in delaying appointments. Against the 419 vacancies currently in the high courts, the Ministry of Law and Justice received a total of only 208 proposals. Fifty-six per cent of these still remain with the Ministry for examination. Some delay is also because of the intelligence bureau\u2019s delay in preparing and submitting background checks. After receiving the reports, the government on an average takes 127 days while the judicial collegium takes 119 days to confirm the recommendations. Often, non-legislated grounds \u2014 such as national security \u2014 give a free-wheeling power to the executive to defer collegium recommendations. Further, they have overruled the Collegium at least once by extending tenure of a High Court judge by one year, instead of two as recommended.\n\nMany of these issues are well known. Time after time, parliamentary proceedings and reports detail the ever increasing vacancies, budgetary constraints and other hurdles affecting the work of the judiciary. Exchanges between the ministerial and judicial top brass, either in public or through reported correspondence, cite lamentations about the state of the judiciary. Rankings and indexes only drive home the same point that India\u2019s legal backlog and lack of judicial capacity continue to reduce its credibility in international markets for contract enforcement. And yet none of these public deliberations on the issues plaguing the judiciary acknowledge that there is an institution that refuses to change the way it functions and takes comfort in institutionalised opacity. Attempting to reform it with organisational changes, be it with increased budgets or manpower, then is an effort in vain.\n\n(Prakhar Misra and Shreyas Narla are Research Associates at the Mercatus Center working on Indian Political Economy)"}

So it\u2019s not a sport. It\u2019s not sport when the success is already guaranteed. It\u2019s not sport when it doesn\u2019t matter if you lose.\u201d\n\nAsked if it was unfair that he was the first person from within Manchester City to speak about the European Super League in public, Guardiola said he needed more information.\n\nThe Spaniard is an admirer of the competitive nature of the Premier League and said it was wrong if clubs such as Leicester City or West Ham United, both challenging for qualification to the Champions League this season, could be denied that dream.\u201dThat\u2019s why I said many times I want the best competition as strong as possible, especially the Premier League,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair when one team fights and fights and arrives at the top and it cannot be qualified because the success is already guaranteed for a few clubs.\u201d\n\nGuardiola said he had only been told of the European Super League a few hours before it was announced.\n\nBut since then he, like everyone else, is waiting for the powerbrokers behind the controversial plan to offer more detail.\n\n\u201cOnce I have all the information I can give you an opinion. I can give my opinion of what I know today but I don\u2019t know more so that\u2019s the reality,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI would love the president of this committee to go out all around the world and say what is the reason why they took that decision. Why some teams will play and the others not. Why Ajax Amsterdam who won four or five Champions Leagues is not there.\n\n\u201cThey have the obligation and the duty to clarify as soon as possible, today better than tomorrow.\u201d\n\nGuardiola said six clubs should not be demonised, though, adding that all clubs and UEFA have self interest at heart."}

With no savings, they borrowed money from their neighbours and left with their three children in search of a bus that could take them to Sitapur in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nStanding with her children at Anand Vihar ISBT while her husband looked for a bus, Pinki said: \u201cWe are afraid we won\u2019t get a bus today. My husband and I don\u2019t have any savings left because our landlord forced us to pay the rent this month and our employers haven\u2019t paid us anything in the last 20 days. How will we survive here if there\u2019s a longer lockdown? The printing press produces school books and election posters but our employers didn\u2019t pay us now because books aren\u2019t being printed these days.

I wish schools reopen soon so I can print books again,\u201d she said.\n\nHundreds of migrants, some of whom could not get a bus or train on Monday, when a week-long lockdown came into effect in Delhi, gathered at Anand Vihar to try again on Tuesday.\n\nGeeta (38), a labourer, lost her job last week and was planning to go home with her son and her husband but the crowd \u201cscared\u201d her.\n\n\u201cWe left our home after we watched the CM\u2019s announcement on television. We get Rs 400 per day but our employers said the factory won\u2019t open for at least a month. When we came here yesterday, I almost lost my son in the crowd. We missed our bus and got so scared that we went back home. Today, we are ready to leave but there are no buses. I packed parathas for the children. We will now work in Hamirpur, UP. I don\u2019t want to come here again,\u201d said Geeta.\n\nThe family shifted to Delhi last year but had to leave during the first lockdown. In December, they came back and got jobs, only to be met with another setback.\n\nThough the terminal was lined with government buses, many seats were full because passengers booked tickets online. In private AC buses, passengers claimed conductors were charging as much as Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 for a seat.\n\nBhim Singh (50), who works at a cloth factory, said he and his wife were initially going to attend a friend\u2019s wedding in Bihar\u2019s Arrah, but have now decided not to return.\n\n\u201cThe factory is shut, my children have already left and are staying with their grandparents. We will do farming. Last week, during the night curfew, I asked my neighbour to book my tickets. It\u2019s scary here, people are pushing each other and nobody is wearing a mask.

As Peter Jackson brought a larger-than-life vision to our cinema screens in Lord of The Rings, it was also a win for motion capture technology. Serkis was to become synonymous with this technology but the duplicitous Gollum was where it all started for him.\n\nIn years to come, we would know him as a giant gorilla (King Kong), a genial bear (Baloo in Jungle Book), the rapidly evolving chimpanzee who will rule the earth (Caesar in War of Planet of the Apes) and a naval captain who loves the bottle as much as alliteration (Captain Haddock in The Adventures of Tintin). As Serkis turns 57 today, here\u2019s putting a spotlight on an actor whose best work is not simply \u2018acting\u2019 in the traditional sense, it is motion-capture acting.\n\nThere is an ongoing debate as to whether motion-capture should be recognised as a legitimate form of acting. When The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King swept the Oscars in 2004 (winning all the eleven categories in which it was nominated), many critics wondered if Andy Serkis should have been nominated in Best Actor or Best Supporting categories. They were of this opinion because his turn had been one of the most striking performances in the entire trilogy.\n\nThe actor himself revels in it. While promoting Tintin, he had said about being \u2018the man with no face\u2019, \u201cI see myself in every single character that I play\u2026 I may not be manifested on screen, but with every acting decision, and every in the moment beat, you\u2019re not just conveying a look, but also a thought and a feeling. You\u2019re embodying the character and giving soul to it.\u201d\n\nHere is a list of five best performances of Serkis\u2019 career. I have included both motion-capture and otherwise.\n\nGollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\n\nGollum, formerly a Hobbit who became corrupted due to the One Ring\u2019s influence, is easily Serkis\u2019 best known role. The character was fascinating and also provided much-needed humour when things got grim in the LOTR trilogy. The humour was due to Gollum\u2019s grammar (he keeps saying \u201cWe wants it\u201d regarding the One Ring) and his two perpetually warring personalities \u2013 one childlike, innocent and helpful, and the other greedy, murderous and evil. Most of the arc of his character in the story is about these two personas vying for control. To say that Andy Serkis gave life to Gollum would be the understatement of the century. Andy Serkis BECAME Gollum. Even without the CGI trappings of the character, Serkis was hardly distinguishable from his character. He crafted a convincing voice for Gollum that did not need any artificial manipulation. This was a driven, committed performance by a supremely talented actor.\n\nKing Kong in King Kong\n\nAfter LOTR trilogy, Serkis once again collaborated with Jackson in 2005\u2019s King Kong, an epic-length remake of the 1933 original. The film was long and felt so, but it was also consistently entertaining and Serkis, along with Jackson and his visual effects company Weta Digital, created a spectacular experience that has not aged even a bit.\n\nCaesar in the Planet of the Apes trilogy\n\nJust like Gollum, Serkis became Caesar in this film trilogy, portraying it first with playfulness as a child, then with a grim determination and a poignancy as the adult chimp. The performance was constantly spell-binding, and another showcase as to why motion-capture acting should be considered as acting.\n\nUlysses Klaue in Black Panther\n\nSerkis\u2019 range is not limited to just motion-capture, and his performance as the crazy, devilish villain Ulysses Klaue in Black Panther is a case in point. Although Klaue died too soon in the film, he anyway left a considerable impact on the moviegoers."}

The company has previously said the vaccine will be available on a not-for-profit basis until the end of the pandemic.\n\nThe company now expects full-year adjusted profit of $9.42 to $9.57 per share from its prior forecast of $9.40 to $9.60 per share, after sales of its cancer drugs helped quarterly profit rise nearly 7%. Net earnings rose to $6.20 billion, or $2.32 per share, in the first quarter from $5.80 billion, or $2.17 per share, a year earlier.\n\nThe company\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine use was paused by U.S. regulators last week as they review reports of rare but serious blood clots in recipients.\n\nExplained | Why countries are restricting travel to and from India\n\nCases in Turkey equivalent to 1% of working population\n\nIn Turkey, second only to India in new coronavirus cases, a recent surge has brought active infections to a peak equivalent to nearly 1% of working age people, a calculation based on health ministry data showed on Tuesday.\n\nDeaths from COVID-19 hit a record 341 on Monday despite more than 20 million vaccines having been administered. About 551,000 Turks have active COVID-19 cases, compared to a working age population of some 57 million, based on a Reuters calculation of official deaths, recoveries and total cases.

The scheme was first approved for 31.1 million people, worth about 210 billion baht, in January during a second virus wave.\n\nThe money can be used until the end of June, extended for another month, government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said in a podcast. About 200 billion baht ($6.4 billion) under the scheme has been injected into the economy, according to the finance ministry. The government also plans to introduce more economic stimulus measures to help ease the virus impact, Anucha said.\n\n\u201cThe government still has nearly 380 billion baht ($12.16 billion) that can be used to support and restore the economy,\u201d he added.\n\nThe new outbreak, which includes a highly contagious variant, have caused over 16,000 infections in three weeks, dealing a further blow to Thailand\u2019s tourism-reliant economy. The spread, which accounts for a third of Thailand\u2019s cases so far, comes as the country takes tentative steps to reopen to foreign visitors after a year of tightened entry controls.\n\nIsrael and Britain exploring possibility of opening green corridor\n\nIsrael and Britain are exploring the possibility of opening a \u201cgreen travel corridor\u201d between them, Israel\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday, citing the success of the two countries\u2019 vaccination drives.

It gave no timeline for implementing such a measure, which apparently would apply only to vaccinated travellers.\n\nBritain, which has the world\u2019s fifth-worst official COVID-19 death toll, has vaccinated 32.9 million people with a first dose.

The emergency involves no curfew or military powers but Parliament is suspended until August 1. Muhyiddin\u2019s government remains in control and has extraordinary powers to introduce laws without parliamentary approval.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad waves as he leaves national palace in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Tuesday, April 20, 2021.

He told reporters outside the palace gate that he hopes the king will heed the people\u2019s voices. More than 39,000 Malaysians have signed an online petition since March for the king to end the emergency.\n\n\u201cThis declaration of a state of emergency is not about fighting COVID-19. Not at all \u2026 it is about a weak government wanting to stay in power,\u201d Mahathir wrote on his blog earlier in the day.\n\nCritics said the emergency has failed to curb new infections, with Malaysia\u2019s total cases more than doubling to over 379,000 since January. Many also questioned why Parliament cannot resume since most restrictions have been lifted, with businesses, malls and schools reopened.\n\nIndonesia approves research of vaccine candidate Nusantara\n\nIndonesia has approved private research of COVID-19 vaccine candidate Nusantara that is backed by a former health minister, after recently saying a mid-stage trial for it could not proceed amid safety and data integrity issues.\n\nThe nod for private research comes amid mounting political pressure to approve the trial for the vaccine, which is backed by former minister Terawan Agus Putranto who enjoys the support of some in Indonesia\u2019s political and military elite. Some parliamentarians have even volunteered to provide blood samples and participate in the study in a show of support.\n\nBut Indonesian scientists and public health experts are worried this sets a wrong precedent for global pharmaceutical firms looking for opportunities to fast track their drugs.\n\nThe Nusantara vaccine uses a dendritic cell method commonly used in research for cancer treatment and is built upon immune cells drawn from patients\u2019 blood. BPOM chief Penny Lukito told Reuters that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed on Monday by the health minister, the drug regulator and the military chief of staff to allow the private research into the vaccine to be conducted at the Gatot Subroto Army Hospital in Jakarta."}

You have to do it (ban) now. Look into taking some oxygen from steel and petroleum industries. They have big pockets and big lobbies, but tell them if they have to cut production, then they can cut production.

Patients cannot. Human lives are at stake,\u201d the bench said.\n\nIt said it has heard that doctors at Ganga Ram Hospital were being forced to reduce oxygen being given to COVID-19 patients admitted there as there was scarcity of oxygen.\n\nThe ministry, in the affidavit filed through central government standing counsel Monika Arora, has also said that in order to increase the capacity of medical oxygen in Delhi, eight Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Oxygen Generation plants are being installed by the support of PM CARES Funds.\n\n\u201cThese plants would enhance capacity of medical oxygen by 14.4 metric tonnes,\u201d the ministry\u2019s affidavit said.\n\nThe observations by the bench came during the hearing of a disposed of petition related to COVID-19 tests and the high court revived it on April 19 by noting that the virus has raised its \u201cugly head\u201d once again and the pandemic is raging with much greater intensity and \u201cit is evident that the healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse\u201d."}

Fearing a big loss in revenue, many producers are withholding their films,\u201d Subramaniam added.\n\nThe second wave has hit the country at a time when the Tamil film industry was bustling with a lot of energy. In the last four months, a few big films had revived the box office business in Tamil Nadu, which suffered considerably following the Covid-induced lockdown last March. It was Vijay\u2019s Master in January, which drew the crowd out of their homes in massive numbers. Theatres made up for the 50 per cent cap on the occupancy by running extra shows and early morning fan shows. And 10 days after its initial release, the film was already in the profit zone. The momentum at the box office was sustained by Godzilla vs. Kong, which came out in March. And Karthi\u2019s Sultan also did solid business as theatres had the permission to function with full occupancy by then.\n\nAnd on April 9, Dhanush\u2019s Karnan hit screens. The hard-hitting film became a top choice for the audience in Tamil Nadu, and it even made good gains in overseas markets. By the end of the first week, the film was declared a blockbuster. \u201cKarnan did a very good business. In distribution circles, none of them incurred the loss,\u201d said Subramaniam.\n\nWith new restrictions in place, many filmmakers have already postponed the release of their films in April. Thalaivi, starring Kangana Ranaut and Arvind Swami, was due in cinemas on April 23. However, the filmmakers withheld its release citing rising Covid-19 cases. So did the makers of MGR Magan, starring Sasikumar and Sathyaraj. And the delay in releasing new films will cause a box office draught once again.\n\n\u201cProducers of films like Doctor and Kodiyil Oruvan are waiting to release their films. But, they will release only after the government allows regular shows and relaxes other restrictions,\u201d added Subramaniam.\n\nUnlike last time, the distributors and exhibitors are more emotionally sorted in handling the crisis as they understand the predicament of the producers as well. \u201cAlso, only when we run shows properly in full swing, we can approach the producers to release their films,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the same time, Tirupur Subramaniam is also confident that the producers would rather wait and release the film in theatres, instead of taking their films to streaming platforms. \u201cI don\u2019t think the producers will go directly to OTT platforms this time. The success of Master and Karnan has given them confidence. They have realized that if they want their movies to make big collections, then they have to stick to theatrical release,\u201d he concluded."}

We are registering hundreds of bookings per minute, 90-95% just for RT-PCR at our three drive-through facilities.

This is unprecedented and we had no time to prepare for this.\u201d\n\nUnable to get slots for home testing, hundreds begin queuing up from the morning at hospitals where testing is available, often waiting between an hour to three hours.\n\nAt the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), a 60-year-old X-ray technician who works there had to join the queue for two days before being allotted a number. He said on Tuesday, \u201cYesterday I came at 9.30 am but there were so many people that I could not get the test done. Today I came at 7.40 am, but the first 100 slots were already taken, so I had to come by noon again.\u201d\n\nWith flu-like symptoms and a fever, he said he wanted to check if he had Covid, even though he has got both doses of the vaccine.\n\nDr D K Sharma, the medical superintendent at AIIMS, said, \u201cWhen the case load had reduced, we were getting 20-25 people \u2014 healthcare workers or their dependents \u2014 tested daily, now we are testing around 250. It has been a significant increase, but we have also increased the working hours of people.\u201d\n\nA dialysis technician working at the Max Hospital, Saket, said he had to get tested at Charak Palika Hospital in Moti Bagh as slots at his hospital were not available. The 30-year-old said, \u201cI have had a fever since yesterday, and even though I am vaccinated, I worked for six days in the Covid ward so I want to check. There is no slot available anywhere; even at private hospitals there are long queues.\u201d\n\nResident doctors conducting tests said they are working overtime but still finding themselves overwhelmed.\n\nThe Delhi government had recently pulled up testing facilities for collecting more samples than they could process, leading to a long wait for results.\n\nOn Tuesday, patients at Primus Multispeciality Hospital in Chanakyapuri also said they had to wait more than an hour in the queue. Said a 56-year-old homemaker who came with her 20-year-old daughter: \u201cI came from Faridabad as there is too much rush there at the centres there.\u201d The MS of the hospital, Dr Subodh, said that due to the increased rush, waiting time is between two and three hours."}

In November 2018, an environmental group called the Sunrise Movement organised a sit-in in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office demanding a congressional committee to address the environmental crisis. A group of Democrats then worked together with Sunrise and created a proposal for a Select Committee on a Green New Deal.\n\nIn February 2019, Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Edward Markey released a 14-page resolution for the Green New Deal. At present, the Green New Deal is a resolution: a roadmap for what America needs to do to address climate change and avoid a global catastrophe. It is best described as a plan for policy changes.\n\nThe resolution says the US must take a leading role in reducing emissions, the main goal is to reduce America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2030 along with creating jobs, establishing universal healthcare, high minimum wages and integrating the US through public transport.\n\nThe prime goal is to decarbonise the economy by reducing carbon emissions to net-zero by switching to 100 percent renewable energy sources. This includes improvements to the public transport network to include more electric vehicles, and also investments in making the network more dense. It aims to possibly ban the sale of gasoline and diesel vehicles by 2030.\n\nAccording to reports, buildings in the US produce 40 per cent of the country\u2019s annual carbon emissions. Proposals aim to reduce emissions by implementing a zero-carbon standard for new buildings and funding for retrofitting of existing buildings that are dependent on natural gas for heating and cooling.\n\nThe fossil fuel industry employs a large number of people and overhauling those industries would leave people without jobs especially in rural areas. This is why for any new deal, job creation will have to be at the core as it aims to transform the economy and public sector by creating jobs for the lower and middle classes. It would involve investment of trillions of dollars and federal job guarantees.\n\nThese jobs will also give voters an opportunity to recognise climate change and do their part for the earth, making the GND a transformational economic policy. The GND wants to make sure that no-one is left behind and hence want to offer protections for people worst hit by historical discrimination \u2014 low income communities, people of colour and indigenous communities.\n\nWho all support it?\n\nWith the Republican Party largely denying climate change and hesitant on taking action, most supporters are from a progressive wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nOver 100 US Congress members support the GND, various US senators including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and even world leaders such as former US vice-president Al Gore and former UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon have publicly expressed support. Vice-President Kamala Harris was also a co-sponsor of the bill.\n\nIt has found widespread support in climate change organisations. In January 2019, over 600 organisations wrote to the US Congress calling for policies to reduce greenhouse emissions. Over 300 local elected officials across 40 US states have also issued letters endorsing the Green New Deal. The Yale Program on Climate Change Communication released a poll data that said GND has strong bi-partisan support among voters.\n\nWhat is the criticism against the GND?\n\nRepublicans say the plan would devastate the economy and lead to tax increases wth the fossil fuel industries witnessing huge job losses.\n\nMore rational critics argue that the 2030 goal is too optimistic and a more realistic one would be 2045 or 2050. There are questions about financing the plan that have been raised by Republicans and Democrats alike. Without a concrete funding and investment strategy, the plan is unlikely to pass in either houses especially since Democrats hold only a small majority in both.\n\nNewsletter | Click to get the day\u2019s best explainers in your inbox\n\nOcasio-Cortez in CBS\u2019s 60 minutes said, \u201cPeople are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes\u201d that will contribute to the GND and has suggested tax rates of upto 60% \u2013 70% for the ultra-rich.\n\nBiden vs. GND\n\nDuring the first US Presidential Debate in 2020, Biden said he didn\u2019t support the GND, but in his climate change plan, the GND will pay for itself.\n\nWhile the GND hasn\u2019t released an estimated cost, it is likely much higher than Biden\u2019s $2 trillion infrastructure proposal. The spending will take place over a course of eight years and to offset the costs, Biden\u2019s plan also proposes tax increases, especially tax revenues on multinationals over a period of 15 years.\n\nJust as in the GND, Biden\u2019s plan will accelerate actions against climate change by adopting renewable and cleaner energy sources and promote racial equality in the economy. It would also improve broadband services, drinking water and commute times.\n\nBiden\u2019s plan aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 whereas the GND sets it a slightly unrealistic 2030. The bill aims to launch a Climate Conservation Corps which will employ people to conserve public lands, it also sets to expand the US electric vehicle market.\n\nIt will also increase spending in R&D and training a new workforce, an idea strongly highlighted in the GND. It shares the same principles with GND when it comes to providing minimum wage to employees, benefits, and freedom to join unions, it doesn\u2019t speak of universal-health care.\n\nThe plan is yet to be passed in both houses of the Congress to be signed into a law. In the House, Democrats hold a small majority but only a razor thin majority in the Senate, with Democratic Vice-President breaking the 50-50 vote."}

As per the report, 87 countries are now electoral autocracies and home to 68 per cent of the global population.\n\nApart from this, the report also pointed to an accelerated autocratisation in several countries including G-20 nation-states United States, Brazil and Turkey that has hastened the decline of democracy globally. Liberal democracies, the report says, have diminished and now constitute only 14 per cent of people.\n\nThe report says that with the backsliding of democracy in Asia-Pacific region, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, the level of democracy enjoyed by the average global citizen in 2020 is down to levels last found around 1990.\n\nThis decline in democracy, the report says, is part of the \u201cthird wave of autocratisation\u201d \u2013 25 countries, home to 34% of the world\u2019s population (2.6 billion people), are in democratic decline by 2020. At the same time, the number of democratising countries have dropped by almost half down to 16 that are home to a mere 4 per cent of the global population.\n\nWhat are the waves of democratisation?\n\nThe concept \u2018Democracy Wave\u2019 was first introduced by the American political scientist Samuel P Huntington in his book \u2018The Third Wave\u2019 in 1991. In the book, he writes that since the early nineteenth century, there have been three major surges of democracy as a political system and two brief periods of decline. He calls these surges as \u2018waves of democracy\u2019 and the ebbs as the \u2018reverse waves.\u2019\n\nAs per Huntington, the first \u2018long\u2019 wave of democratisation began in the 1820s, with the widening of the suffrage to a large proportion of the male population in the United States, and continued for almost a century until 1926, bringing into being some 29 democracies including France, Britain, Canada, Australia, Italy and Argentina.\n\nHe argues that this \u2018long and slow wave\u2019 was followed by a \u2018reverse wave\u2019 leading to the weakening of the democratisation process. Between Mussolini\u2019s rise to power in 1922 and 1942, the number of democratic states in the world was brought down to a mere 12.\n\nThe triumph of the Allied Forces in World War II initiated a second wave of democratisation taking the number of democratic countries to 36 by 1962. This, says Huntington in the book, was followed by a second reverse wave (1960-1975) that brought the number of democracies back down to 30.\n\nThe third wave of democratisation, Huntington proposes, began with the Carnation revolution in Portugal in 1974 and continued with a number of democratic transitions in Latin America in the 1980s, Asia Pacific countries and, saliently, in Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He points out that this democratic wave was so strong in Latin America that out of 20 countries in the continent, only two countries (Cuba and Haiti) remained authoritarian by 1995.\n\nIn 1991, when he published the book, he observed that signs of the commencement of a third reverse wave were already there, with nascent democracies like Haiti, Sudan returning to authoritarianism.\n\nWhat are waves of Autocratisation?\n\nFollowing Huntington\u2019s lead, a number of political scientists have used these concepts to explain the ebbs and flows in the march of democracy.\n\nFor example, in March 2019, Anna L\u00fchrmann and Staffan I. Lindberg published a research article, \u2018A third wave of autocratisation is here: what is new about it?\u2019 in which they mapped the strengthening and weakening of democracies across the globe in over a century and \u2018identified\u2019 a distinct third wave of autocratisation that commenced in 1994.\n\nThey used V-Dem\u2019s data on 182 countries from 1900 to the end of 2017 (or 18,031 country-years ) to demonstrate a third wave of autocratisation. They did this by identifying a total of 217 \u2018autocritisation episodes\u2019 in 109 countries from 1900 to 2017.\n\nThe three waves of autocratisation as mapped by Anna L\u00fchrmann and Staffan I. Lindberg. (Source: research paper by Anna L\u00fchrmann and Staffan I. Lindberg) The three waves of autocratisation as mapped by Anna L\u00fchrmann and Staffan I. Lindberg. (Source: research paper by Anna L\u00fchrmann and Staffan I. Lindberg)\n\nThe dates for the first two reverse waves presented by them are very similar to Huntington\u2019s despite the conceptual and measurement differences. As per them, during the first reverse wave 1922\u20131942 a total of 32 autocratisation episodes took place; they identified 62 episodes in the second reverse wave between 1960\u20131975; during the ongoing \u2018third wave\u2019 of autocratisation they located 75 episodes starting from 1942 (until 2019).\n\n\u201cBy 2017, the third wave of autocratisation dominated with the reversals outnumbering the countries making progress. This had not occurred since 1940,\u201d they say in the paper.\n\n\u201cIn sum, an important characteristic of the third wave of autocratisation is unprecedented: It mainly affects democracies \u2013 and not electoral autocracies as the earlier period \u2013 and this occurs while the global level of democracy is close to an all-time high. Hence, for now at least, the trend is manifest, but less dramatic than some claim,\u201d they say.\n\nAuotocratisation has become less dramatic\n\nPolitical scientists like Micheal Coppedge note that a key contemporary pattern of autocratisation is the gradual concentration of power in the executive, apart from the more \u201cclassical\u201d path of intensified repression.\n\nLarry Diamond, another American political scientist sees the decade 2006 to 2016 as that of an incipient decline in democracy bringing in instability and stagnation among democracies. As per him, the decade brought an incremental decline of \u2018grey-zone democracy\u2019 (which defy easy classification as to whether or not they are democracies), deepened authoritarianism in the non-democracies, and caused decline in functioning and self-confidence of the established, rich democracies.\n\nAlthough various observers including V-Dem, Freedom House, point to substantial autocratisation over the last decade in countries as diverse as the United States, India, Russia, Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, the democratic breakdowns have become less conspicuous. This, political scientists say, is because the contemporary autocrats have \u201cmastered the art of subverting electoral standards without breaking their democratic fa\u00e7ade completely.\u201d\n\n\u201cDemocratic breakdowns used to be rather sudden events \u2013 for instance, military coups \u2013 and relatively easy to identify empirically. Now, multi-party regimes slowly become less meaningful in practice making it increasingly difficult to pinpoint the end of democracy,\u201d pinpoint Luhrmann and Lindberg in the article mentioned earlier.\n\n\u201cA gradual transition into electoral authoritarianism is more difficult to pinpoint than a clear violation of democratic standards, and provides fewer opportunities for domestic and international opposition. Electoral autocrats secure their competitive advantage through subtler tactics such as censoring and harassing the media, restricting civil society and political parties and undermining the autonomy of election management bodies. Aspiring autocrats learn from each other and are seemingly borrowing tactics perceived to be less risky than abolishing multi-party elections altogether,\u201d they argue.\n\nAs per Luhrmann and Lindberg, the \u2018erosion model\u2019 has emerged as the prominent tactic in the third wave of autocratisation. The first and second waves, on the other hand, were dominated by blatant methods such as military coups, foreign invasions or abolishment of the key democratic institutions by a legally elected officer.\n\n\u201cDemocratic erosion became the modal tactic during the third wave of autocratisation. Here, incumbents legally access power and then gradually, but substantially, undermine democratic norms without abolishing key democratic institutions. Such processes account for 70 per cent in the third reversal wave with prominent cases of such gradual deterioration in Hungary and Poland. Aspiring autocrats have clearly found a new set of tools to stay in power, and that news has spread,\u201d write Luhrmann and Lindberg.\n\nThe \u2018Third Wave\u2019 accelerates\n\nAs per the latest V-DEM report, in 2020, the third wave of autocratisation has accelerated considerably. \u201c\u2026It now engulfs 25 countries and 34 per cent of the world population (2.6 billion). Over the last ten years the number of democratizing countries dropped by almost half to 16, hosting a mere 4 per cent of the global population,\u201d says the report.\n\nThe Third Wave by Samuel P Huntington\n\nA third wave of autocratization is here: what is new about it? by Anna L\u00fchrmann & Staffan I.

It depicted the leader sitting naked on a golden toilet, golden toilet brush in hand, with a bottle of cleaning agent labeled \u201cNovichok\u201d beside him. A nearby protest banner, meanwhile, accused Putin of being a \u201cMurderer, Thief, Dictator.\u201d Protesters had turned out to show their solidarity with jailed Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny \u2014 and mock Putin\u2019s gargantuan Black Sea luxury villa.\n\nThe next day, Czech prime minister Andrej Babis announced that two major 2014 explosions at a munition depot in the country\u2019s southeast which left two dead had been traced back to Russian operatives. He said the blasts had been conducted by Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence service. Czech authorities proceeded to expel 18 Russian diplomats. Authorities also called for the arrest of two GRU agents suspected of involvement in the 2014 explosions. They are the same two men involved in the 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in London.\n\nThe Russian government dismissed the accusations, with the foreign ministry branding them \u201cabsurd.\u201d In a tit for tat move, Russia expelled 20 Czech diplomats \u2014 almost its entire embassy staff.\n\nAct of aggression \u2013\n\nRevelations surrounding the 2014 blasts sparked outrage and a veritable political earthquake in the Czech Republic. Interior Minister Jan Hamacek, who is also the country\u2019s acting foreign minister, called off a scheduled visit to Moscow where he had planned to discuss a deal to buy the Russian Sputnik V vaccine. High-ranking opposition lawmakers, among them Civic Democratic Party (ODS) leader Petr Fiala, called Putin\u2019s actions \u201cRussian state terrorism.\u201d And Prime Minister Babis announced he would discuss how to proceed against Russia with EU and NATO officials.\n\nMedia pundits and political analysts agree this is a grave affair. Indeed, Jakub Janda of the European Values Center for Security Policy, a Prague-based think tank, told DW the bombings mark the \u201cmost hostile attack on Czech territory since the Soviet invasion of 1968.\u201d\n\nRussian troll factories, mafia \u2013\n\nJiri Pehe, a political analyst and former advisor to former President Vaclav Havel, argues referring to Russian conduct as \u201cstate terrorism\u201d is justified. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he says, \u201cRussia\u2019s hostile activities in the Czech Republic go well beyond these actions.\u201d Pehe says \u201cthousands of Russian \u2018business people\u2019 work for the Russian state, troll factories and the Russian mafia.\u201d He says the Russian embassy in Prague is completely oversized, with a staff over more than 100 people. \u201cWe don\u2018t know what half of them actually do.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Czech government claims to have \u201chard evidence\u201d Russian GRU agents conducted the October and December 2014 blasts at the Vrbetice arms depot, certain aspects of the affair remain shrouded in mystery.\n\nIt was by mistake that the weapons and munitions in question exploded on Czech soil. Apparently, they were destined for export to Ukraine or Syria, a deal the Bulgarian arms dealer Emilian Gebrev was meant to handle. In April 2015 he was poisoned and barely survived. It later emerged the Russian GRU was responsible for the attack.\n\nClear timing \u2013\n\nCzech media outlets have speculated over the timing of the ammunition depot explosion revelations. One thing, meanwhile, is for certain. Czech foreign policy will be not be same after this.\n\nThe EU state is deeply divided over its relationship with Moscow. President Milos Zeman, ridiculed by some commentators as \u201cRussia\u2019s Prague ambassador\u201d polarizes opinions. He has recognized the Crimean Peninsula as a \u201cRussian territory,\u201d saying that Ukraine should now be compensated with Russian oil and gas.\n\nZeman under pressure \u2013\n\nPresident Zeman\u2019s office announced he will comment on the delicate affair next Sunday. \u201cThis shows that the feels under pressure and has lost his political footing,\u201d says Jiri Pehe. The calls for him to be sacked are increasing, says Pehe, as \u201crumors exist according to which he knew about the details of the Vrbetice explosions and tried to sabotage the work of the Czech intelligence domestic security agency, BIS.\u201d\n\nThe country\u2019s Social Democrats \u2014 a junior coalition partner in the government alliance \u2014 are divided over Russia. Party leader Jan Hamacek recently dismissed his fellow party member Tomas Petricek from his job as foreign minister due to his cautious stance toward Russia and refusal to buy the Sputnik V vaccine.\n\nBabis changes tack \u2013\n\nPrime Minister Andrej Babis, of the populist ANO party, has urged his country to maintain economic ties with Russia \u2014 while avoiding Zeman\u2019s overtly pro-Russian stance. Babis has carefully weighed his words when commenting on the 2014 blasts. Unlike the opposition, he has avoided talking of \u201cRussian state terrorism.\u201d\n\nBut with parliamentary elections coming up in a few months\u2019 time, he simply cannot remain silent on the issue. He must position himself, or risk seriously undermining his party\u2019s electoral chances.\n\nEconomic fallout \u2013\n\nAs far as next steps after the expulsion of the diplomats go, the Czech government is expected to announce that Russian company Rosatom will no longer be involved in expanding the country\u2019s Dukovany nuclear power plant. Security expert Janda thinks the country will now take a more \u201cconfrontational stance regarding act of Russian aggression.\u201d\n\nAnd political scientist Pehe is certain that both the government and ordinary Czechs will now expect the EU to speak with a united voice and condemn Russia over the bombings \u2014 just as it spoke out after the Skripal poisoning in March 2018."}

The royal scion Pradyot Manikya Debbarma was instrumental in engineering the resettlement deal with central government and state governments of Tripura and Mizoram.\n\nOf these people, 202 migrant families relocated to Bongofapara while the rest 224 families went to Hadukololpara to stay temporarily in the newly-built makeshift houses as permanent residents of the state.\n\nThe state administration has made arrangements for them, including ration and water, a senior official informed. As part of the relocation process, Tripura has identified 15 locations for Bru resettlement and completed Aadhar enrollment of the Brus.\n\nEarlier, a group of local ethnic organisations protested against the resettlement plan and resorted to several agitations, including a few violent protests, in which two persons were killed and 20 others injured in North Tripura last year.\n\nThe displaced Bru came from Mamit, Kolasib and Lunglei districts of neighbouring Mizoram, fleeing ethnic clashes in 1997. Over 5,000 of them were repatriated in nine phases since 2009, while almost the same number from other areas of Mizoram fled to Tripura due to fresh clashes within this time frame."}

Wearing a mask is a cogent key to curtailing the effects of the virus and the same should be followed imperatively. The mask is the only weapon that acts as a shield in this pandemic. When you wear your mask, you\u2019re protecting not only yourself from the disease, but your loved ones too!\n\nThis is the message that Croma intended to spread through \u2018The Times Power of Print\u2019 (POP) campaign. The concept of POP is to embolden creative minds as well as students; to devise impactful campaigns that are inspiring and engaging, leaving behind a thought-provoking missive.\n\nThe 4th edition of Power of Print (POP) saw Croma, partner with The Times Group for the second time, seeking ingenious ideas to uphold the tenor of this year\u2019s brief \u2013 \u2018wear a mask not to protect yourself, but to protect the world from you\u2019.\n\nRitesh Ghosal, CMO, Infiniti Retail Ltd. (Croma) said, \u201cTo move beyond the pandemic, we need to step out in the world and resume our productive lives and the mask is an essential safe-guard against a resurgence of infections. Till date, India as a society has achieved limited success in persuading people to wear masks in public. A false sense of invincibility combined with the mistaken belief that the mask is intended to protect the wearer from the world has led to compliance only by some people and some of the time. Croma which started serving customers in its physical stores since early June has witnessed this reluctance to comply among customers first hand. I believe the answer lies in educating the individual \u2013 creating awareness that the mask actually helps protect his loved ones from him rather than him from the rest of the world\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s winning entry \u2018Spot the Serial Killer\u2019 conceptualised by WYP Brand Solutions endorsed the use of wearing masks to reduce the chances of contracting the virus. The winning team has won not only the Power of Print trophy, but also an opportunity to see their campaign released in the pages of the Times of India Group publications.\n\nThe POP campaign works as an extension to Croma\u2019s approach towards providing a safe and an ambient shopping environment for all. Right from ensuring that all safety protocols are followed at the stores \u2013 like donning a mask, sanitization stations, social distancing, to introducing other convenient shopping channels. Croma has introduced several features that allow the customers to shop from the comfort of their very homes. 1) the \u2018Shop with Video\u2019 feature allows shoppers to connect with the store staff via a live video call and close the purchase without having to visit the store 2) the \u2018connect to store\u2019 feature, that allows a customer to simply book a slot or speak to the store manager before he/ she visits the store. These features are sure to change the way the world shops for electronics.\n\nWith this powerful print campaign, Croma also launches its summer campaign \u2018Cool Life\u2019, that provides cooling solutions for every cooling need. Shoppers can choose from over 250 ACs, 300 Refrigerators, 100+ Fans & Coolers and avail of No Cost EMI options, Cashbacks and much more.\n\nVisit your nearest Croma store or http://www.croma.com today for more."}

Prague had then expelled two Russian diplomats, and Moscow did the same.\n\nWhy Prague expelled Russia\u2019s diplomats\n\nAccording to Czech intelligence, Russian operatives were involved in an October 2014 blast at an arms storage depot in a wooded part of the country near the border with Slovakia. Two people who worked there died, and their remains were found after more than a month. The incident was then labelled an accident.\n\nHowever, investigative work by Czech authorities led them to lay the blame on Russia, specifically Unit 29155 of its GRU intelligence agency, the BBC reported.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 JOIN NOW \ud83d\udce3: The Express Explained Telegram Channel\n\nReports in Czech media claimed that munitions at the depot were destined for Ukraine to fight Russia-backed forces, or to forces against the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, which Russia supports. The Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babis, said the attack had been aimed at a shipment to a Bulgarian arms trader, Reuters reported.\n\nLink to the Salisbury Poisonings\n\nTwo persons linked with the blasts have been identified by the Czech Republic, and stand accused in the attempted poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent who along with his daughter Yulia was administered a nerve agent in Salisbury in the UK in 2018.\n\nThe accused Alexander Mishkin, 41 (left), and Anatoly Chepigov, 43. (Metropolitan Police via AP) The accused Alexander Mishkin, 41 (left), and Anatoly Chepigov, 43. (Metropolitan Police via AP)\n\nHis poisoning is the subject of the BBC One drama titled, \u201cThe Salisbury Poisonings\u201d. Both Skripal and his daughter survived, but a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, was died three months later by the same Novichok nerve agent from a discarded perfume bottle.\n\nCzech authorities matched the images of the men accused of the blast with those of the duo the UK accused for the Salisbury incident.\n\nAs per the BBC report, Czech police were able to do this using the passport scans the two had submitted to the company that had been operating the arms depot. The company, Imex Group, had received an email supposedly from the National Guard of Tajikistan, which asked for permission for a site inspection by the two men, one of whom it said was a Tajik national and the other from Moldova.\n\nThe two had booked accommodation near the blast site from October 13 to 17, and the blast occurred on October 16. The same day of the explosion, the pair went to Austria and took a flight to Moscow.\n\nRussia has denied all accusations, calling them absurd.\n\nWhat could happen now\n\nThe diplomatic escalation between Prague and Moscow is believed to be the most serious since 1989, when the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe ended.\n\nIt also adds to the worsening of relations between the West and Russia, which are already being tested by Russia\u2019s military buildup on its western frontier as well as in Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Twitter that the Czechs \u201chave exposed the lengths that the GRU will go to in their attempts to conduct dangerous and malign operations\u201d.\n\nThe US has also said that it stands with its NATO ally in its \u201cfirm response against Russia\u2019s subversive actions on Czech soil\u201d.

I came to Hollywood as a newcomer, I thought they\u2019d be impressed by that.

I\u2019d protest in trade papers, that it is wrong. When they did have a role for an Asian, they didn\u2019t have a hesitation painting a white actor brown and giving him the role.

In Bold and the Beautiful, I played a Moroccan prince, so it is playing the foreign tag that got me the roles. In those days, Krishna Bhanji had to change his name to Ben Kingsley to get roles.

Possessing an Oscar trophy instantly catapults you among the greats. Oscars were going to be held on February 28, but the Covid-19 pandemic ensured they were rescheduled to April 25 (April 26 morning as per Indian time).\n\nSince this year, Oscars cover all of 2020 and also a bit of 2021, the categories are hotly contested. This is despite fewer film releases.\n\nEver year, ahead of Oscars, we predict our favourites in the main categories. We begin our prediction of 2021 with the Best Supporting Actor category. And we believe the actor who will take this trophy is\u2026\n\nDaniel Kaluuya for Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nEver since he rose to fame with 2017\u2019s Get Out, Daniel Kaluuya\u2019s star has been rising consistently. In Warner Bros\u2019 biopic Judas and the Black Messiah, he gave the best performance of his career.\n\nHe slipped into the accent of iconic Marxist-Leninist and revolutionary socialist chairman of Black Panther Party\u2019s Illinois chapter Fred Hampton. Thanks to his perfect grasp of the mannerisms and accent (Kaluuya is British and nailed the Chicago South Side accent), Kaluuya was a very convincing Fred Hampton\n\nKaluuya had had a dream run this awards season in this particular category. He clinched the Golden Globe, Critics\u2019 Choice, Bafta, Screen Actors Guild award for the role. We feel it is a no-brainer here. Barring a major upset, Kaluyaa is taking this.\n\nThe other nominees in the category are\u2026\n\nSacha Baron Cohen for The Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nSacha Baron Cohen was brilliant in Aaron Sorkin\u2019s The Trial of the Chicago 7 as political and social activist Abbie Hoffman and deserves the nomination. A courtroom drama based on the trial of the titular group of people who protested the Vietnam War, the film was star-studded and had many notable performances. Cohen, while not too well-known for serious dramatic performances, managed to distinguish himself spectacularly.\n\nLeslie Odom Jr. for One Night in Miami\u2026\n\nLeslie Odom Jr\u2019s performance has not been the talk of the awards season, and yet critics agree it is one of the best of 2020. Playing singer Sam Cooke, Leslie Odom Jr. was part of Regina King\u2019s directorial debut called One Night in Miami\u2026 in which 4 notable Black personalities, including Malcolm X, Jim Brown, Cooke and Muhammad Ali, come together.\n\nPaul Raci in Sound of Metal\n\nPaul Raci played the role of deaf mentor to Riz Ahmed\u2019s Ruben, a musician who loses his hearing. Raci has been an actor for 40 years of his life on stage mainly and has done small roles in TV and movies. It was this indie film that finally gave him fame and an Oscar nomination. If any actor can beat Kaluuya, it is Raci.\n\nLakeith Stanfield for Judas and the Black Messiah\n\nLakeith Stanfield was extremely convincing as the shifty William \u201cBill\u201d O\u2019Neal, an FBI informant who ratted Hampton out to the FBI. The Academy\u2019s decision to make Stanfield and Kaluuya both supporting actors for a film that seemingly had no lead actor was ridiculed on social media. But if there was any lead in the film, it was Stanfield."}

The results of their work were published in the journal Cell on April 15. While the results might imply progress for this particular field of research called \u201cchimera research\u201d, they have also ignited a debate about how ethical studies of this kind are.\n\nWhat have the researchers done?\n\nBy integrating human cells into the embryos of macaque monkeys, researchers have created what is called a chimeric tool. Chimeras are organisms that are made up of the cells of two distinct species, in this case humans and monkeys. For instance, if this hybrid embryo was placed in the womb of a monkey, it could possibly grow into a new kind of an animal (however this was not the aim of this study).\n\nIn this study, the monkey embryos containing human stem cells stayed alive and grew outside the body for a period of 19 days.\n\nPreviously, in a 2017 study researchers integrated human cells into pig tissues as they thought that pigs, whose organ size, physiology and anatomy are similar to that of humans, could help them in creating organs that could ultimately be transplanted to humans.\n\nBut this experiment failed and they believe it is because of the large evolutionary distance between pigs and humans (about 90 million years). Therefore, after this experiment, they decided to pick a species that was more closely related to humans, hence macaque monkeys were chosen.\n\nWhat\u2019s the purpose of chimeric research?\n\nResearchers believe that this ability to grow cells of two different species together offers scientists a powerful tool for research and medicine, advancing current understanding about early human development, disease onset and progression and ageing. Further, research of this kind could also help in drug evaluation and address the critical need for organ transplantation.\n\nResearchers note how chimeric tools provide a new platform to study how certain diseases arise. For instance, a particular gene that is associated with a certain type of cancer could be engineered in a human cell. Researchers could then study the course of disease progression using the engineered cells in a chimeric model, which may be able to tell them more about the disease than results obtained from an animal model.\n\nBut what are the ethical concerns about this?\n\nSome rare hybrid animals exist naturally and were probably the result of unintentional cross breeding between animals of different species. In 2014, a rare hybrid animal called \u201cGeep\u201d was born in an Irish farm. Geep was a hybrid between a goat and a sheep, a result of the two mating. However, the birth of this geep was not artificially induced and the cross-breeding is believed to have happened unintentionally. Generally, different species don\u2019t cross-breed and if they do, their offspring don\u2019t survive for long and are prone to infertility.\n\nMules are another example of a hybrid animal that are the result of mating between a female horse and a male donkey. As per the Mule Museum, these hybrid animals are the result of intentional breeding by humans, which they first undertook in the ancient times. While mules can live a long healthy life, they are infertile which means that they cannot have offspring of their own.\n\nNewsletter | Click to get the day\u2019s best explainers in your inbox\n\nEven so, research that concerns itself with gene editing or something like chimera research, which involves artificially integrating cells from two distinct species concerns some scientists on ethical grounds. The reason is that while further research into chimeras might lead to progress, which could mean that they could be used as a source of organs for humans, these chimeras would still be a mix of human and non-human cells, a thought that makes many uncomfortable.\n\nWriting in Pursuit, Professor Julian Savulescu and Dr Julian Koplin, of the University of Melbourne, note that chimeric research raises \u201cthe philosophical and ethical issue of moral status: how should we treat other life forms?\u201d. They argue that chimera research has the potential to worsen injustice against animals and also point out the fairness in using part-human animals to meet human needs.\n\nIn the case of the recent research at Salk, researchers have made it clear that the chimeras created with macaques will not be used for human organ transplants but that they \u201cnevertheless reveal invaluable information about how human cells develop and integrate, and how cells of different species communicate with one another.\u201d Some scientists, however, are still skeptical since they feel that one of the goals of chimera research is to create organs that can be transplanted to humans.\n\nIn 2018, Dr He Jiankui made headlines when he claimed to have produced genetically modified babies using the gene editing technique CRISPR. Jiankui claimed that he had altered the genes of a human embryo that eventually resulted in the birth of twin girls with specific desired attributes \u2014 supposedly the first instance of human offspring so produced \u2014 using newly-developed tools of gene \u201cediting\u201d. The genes of the twins were \u201cedited\u201d to ensure they do not get infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, according to the claims.\n\nIn December 2020 a court in China sentenced him to prison for three years, with a fine of 3 million yuan (approx. Rs 3 crore), for illegal medical practice.\n\nTherefore, genetic modification like chimera studies continues to be a subject of major debate. In developing countries like India, genetically modified crops are also a contentious topic. Tampering with the genetic code in human beings is more controversial, as any such change can be passed down to future generations."}

(file photo)\n\nIndia has told China that the significance of the consensus reached between their leaders to maintain peace along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) cannot be \u201cswept under the carpet\u201d and called for the complete disengagement of troops in eastern Ladakh to rebuild bilateral ties strained by the \u201cserious incidents\u201d which has strongly impacted the public opinion.\n\nIn a candid address to the ICWA (Indian Council of World Affairs)-CPIFA (Chinese People\u2019s Institute of Foreign Affairs) virtual dialogue on April 15, Indian Ambassador to China Vikram Misri also questioned the Chinese officials ignoring the \u201csignificant consensus\u201d reached by the leaders of the two sides about the importance of maintaining peace along the LAC.\n\nIn his lengthy speech, Misri said no country can set the agenda for itself without agreements from other countries, in an apparent reference to China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its flagship project the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor over which India has raised concerns as it is being laid through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.\n\nThe BRI is a multi-billion-dollar initiative launched by President Xi Jinping when he came into power in 2013. It aims to link Southeast Asia, Central Asia, the Gulf region, Africa and Europe with a network of land and sea routes.\n\nChina also claims sovereignty over all of South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.\n\n\u201cIn a multi-polar world, no country can set the agenda by itself without prior agreement and consultation, and then expect everyone else to come on board. No single country can expect a discussion to focus only on issues of its own interest while ignoring those raised or reflected by others,\u201d Misri said.\n\nAbout the consensus between the leaders of the two countries for good relations, he said, \u201cit has often been pointed out by friends in China that we should stick to the consensus between our leaders. I have absolutely no quarrel with that\u201d.\n\n\u201cIndeed, I agree wholeheartedly. At the same time, I should point out that equally significant consensus has been reached between our leaders in the past as well, for instance the consensus that I just referred to on the importance of maintaining peace and tranquility, and it is important to stick to that consensus as well,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have also seen a tendency in some quarters to sweep this situation under the carpet and characterize it as just a minor issue and a matter of perspective. This too is inadvisable as it can only take us further away from a sustained solution to present difficulties and deeper into an unfulfilling stalemate,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn fact, it would be tantamount to running away from the problem and in a direction opposite to that where the promise of our closer development partnership lies,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the leaders \u201crecognised the inevitable presence of competition in the relationship, they also simultaneously prioritised cooperation and shunned containment, because they believed that containment was neither feasible nor advisable in respect of either country\u201d, he said.\n\nThough the border mechanisms were tested on multiple occasions, they \u201chelped maintain the all-important peace and tranquility on the borders, thereby helping create the environment in which the India-China relationship grew spectacularly between 1988 and 2019,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBut we must acknowledge that these enabling structures and the fundamental premise of the closer developmental partnership have been placed under considerable strain by the serious incidents and the resultant violation of peace and tranquility at the LAC in Eastern Ladakh in April 2020 and thereafter. The impact on public opinion has been particularly strong,\u201d Misri said.\n\nIndian and Chinese troops are locked in a prolonged standoff in eastern Ladakh since May last year. Soldiers from both sides completed withdrawal of troops from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February. But the disengagement has not taken place yet from various other areas in eastern Ladakh.\n\nTop Commanders of the two militaries held the 11th round of talks on April 9 to disengage the troops from Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang areas in Eastern Ladakh.\n\nMisri said the \u201csustainable solution\u201d to the \u201cpresent difficulties\u201d in India-China relations is \u201cit must be one, as External Affairs Minister Dr. S Jaishankar has suggested, that is based on mutual sensitivity and respect and paves the way for maximizing our mutual interests\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe first is to note the importance of the two sides having maintained a sustained diplomatic and military dialogue in attempting to resolve issues. These discussions thus far have helped in achieving substantial disengagement of our forces,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe second is to point out that senior leaders on both sides have committed and agreed that we must achieve complete disengagement in all friction areas. That would be an important first step towards considering de-escalation; it would also help in restoring peace and tranquility and, together, these would provide conditions for gradual and step-by-step progress in the bilateral relationship,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is also what would begin to restore trust and confidence in the relationship and help us rebuild the foundation of the relationship that was damaged through last year\u2019s actions in Eastern Ladakh,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said it was also important to recognize that in a post-pandemic world of altered equations, multipolarity is probably more important than ever, both in the Indo-Pacific and beyond."}

But in a bizarre decision, Morgan took the mystery spinner out of the attack and brought in Shakib-Al-Hasan as Glenn Maxwell and AB de Villiers powered them to 204/4.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Morgan persists with Shakib or bring in seaming Aussie all-rounder Ben Cutting in the less spin-friendly conditions.\n\nMorgan also has persisted with the veteran Harbhajan Singh and gave him the opening overs in all the three matches. Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav could be a better option.\n\nHead coach Brendon McCullum has already hinted of making some changes after their 38-run defeat to RCB.\n\nAs for CSK, opener Ruturaj Gaikwad is enduring a terrible form with scores of 5, 5 and 10 and it remains to be seen whether he is given a longer rope by Dhoni who is not known to tinker his XI much.\n\nSquads\n\nKKR: Eoin Morgan (c), Dinesh Karthik, Shubman Gill, Nitish Rana, Tim Seifert, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Sunil Narine, Kuldeep Yadav, Shivam Mavi, Lockie Ferguson, Pat Cummins, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Sandeep Warrier, Prasidh Krishna, Rahul Tripathi, Varun Chakravarthy, Shakib Al Hasan, Sheldon Jackson, Vaibhav Arora, Harbhajan Singh, Karun Nair, Ben Cutting, Venkatesh Iyer and Pawan Negi.\n\nCSK: MS Dhoni (c & wk), Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, KM Asif, Deepak Chahar, Dwayne Bravo, Faf du Plessis, Imran Tahir, N Jagadeesan, Karn Sharma, Lungi Ngidi, Mitchell Santner, Ravindra Jadeja, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shardul Thakur, Sam Curran, Josh Hazlewood, R Sai Kishore, Robin Uthappa, Moeen Ali, Krishnappa Gowtham, Cheteshwar Pujara, M Harisankar Reddy, K Bhagath Varma and C Hari Nishaanth.\n\nMatch starts: 7.30pm IST."}

Now, a company wants to spin this into something beneficial for the environment.\n\nPaper Seed Co, a social enterprise from the outskirts of Mangaluru in southern Karnataka, has come up with a face mask that will not only protect people from the virus, but when discarded, will bloom into a plant. The innovative eco-friendly idea has struck a chord with the public and has created a huge buzz online.\n\nFounder Nitin Vas said cotton masks are actually made from recycled rags. \u201cThe outer cover is made from cotton plup utilising various scrap materials collected from the garment industry, and the inner linings are made from soft cotton cloth. They are thick enough, and effective to prevent infection,\u201d he explained to indianexpress.com over telephone.\n\nThe company, which has been making various recycled and plant seed goods since 2017, started experimenting with masks when the pandemic hit. \u201cMasks are essential for humans but they are also creating problems for other species. We see them lying on the streets and ending up in landfills, but forget that it also ends up in rivers and oceans creating irreparable damage to the environment and aquatic life,\u201d the 36-year-old said, explaining the idea behind his project.\n\nEach of the masks is handmade and the outer layer is embedded with seeds of plants or vegetables.(Source: Paper Seed Co) Each of the masks is handmade and the outer layer is embedded with seeds of plants or vegetables.(Source: Paper Seed Co)\n\nAlthough made from cotton, his masks are single-use only. Once used, one simply needs to throw them in the soil, water it a little and in a few days, it will hopefully grow into a plant.\n\nALSO READ | Medical masks or fabric masks: WHO shares guidelines on who should wear what\n\nAs the company already had the knowledge of making paper embedded with plant seeds, they used it to take it a step forward and implement it in cotton materials. But there is a cost to being environmentally conscious. At Rs 25 per piece, these single-use masks are not cheap, but we have to consider that each of the masks is handmade under a \u201claborious process\u201d.\n\n\u201cA product is truly eco-friendly only when it doesn\u2019t involve bigger industrial setups. These are not machine-made and hence, we can\u2019t roll out hundreds of products as they do in factories,\u201d Vas explained. \u201cThe process to create pulp and make sheets itself takes up around eight hours after which it takes another 12 hours to dry. Then each mask is cut out by hand using stencils and stitched. So, I would say, it\u2019s fairly priced,\u201d he added.\n\nVolunteers from in and around Pakshikere hamlet of Dakshina Kannada district are behind the unique project. (Source: Nitin Vas) Volunteers from in and around Pakshikere hamlet of Dakshina Kannada district are behind the unique project. (Source: Nitin Vas)\n\nFor Vas, however, the product and the company are much bigger than just making eco-friendly goods as his project generates employment in and around Pakshikere hamlet of Dakshina Kannada district. \u201cI believe in Gandhian philosophy of Swadeshi movement, where the core principle is to come up with sustainable solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cOurs is not a business model to generate profit but to find an ecological solution for a better future, where we train our village folks and harness the power of talented youths.\u201d\n\nBefore the pandemic hit, the organisation had nearly 300 people working on different products. Now, the number is not even 10 per cent. \u201cBecause it has seeds, our product can\u2019t be stored for a very long time. When lockdown happened we had to discard huge batches of seed paper which we failed to deliver,\u201d Vas said.\n\nEver since the company was started in 2017, it has tried to generate employment for villagers mostly the women in the hamlet. (Source: Nitin Vas) Ever since the company was started in 2017, it has tried to generate employment for villagers mostly the women in the hamlet. (Source: Nitin Vas)\n\nSo, despite being overwhelmed by orders, Vas doesn\u2019t want to increase his exposure or risk. \u201cOur setup collapsed last year during the pandemic. Now, even if I\u2019m getting orders to create one lakh masks, I can\u2019t make it. I have enough volunteers registered with the trust to make it but what if I employ them and by the time we finish making it, it can\u2019t be delivered to the party, it\u2019ll again all lead up being a waste, and I can\u2019t take that risk anymore and put the villagers\u2019 earnings at danger,\u201d he explained. He has been engaging only with local and regional clients and smaller orders up to 3,000 masks.\n\nHis dream is to build a Paper Seed village with a larger workshop. But it is far from easy. \u201cI have the land, we have also started building a few of the workshops, but more funds are needed to start a proper setup,\u201d he said. \u201cAlthough we have got offers from businesses we don\u2019t want to enter the trap of getting into a profit-making business because then our core value will be compromised,\u201d he said adding that they are open to taking up financial opportunities if it aligns with their ideology keeping the villagers in the centre."}

It has been understood that the UK, as of now, has added India to the \u2018red list\u2019 for COVID-19 travel. What does it mean, and what should travellers know about moving between these two countries?

And if you think it is sort of insensitive and irresponsible on the part of such celebrities, you are not alone. Even actor-singer Shruti Haasan feels the same.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Quint, Shruti suggested flashing one\u2019s privilege during such a distressing time is not responsible behaviour. \u201cGlad they had a great holiday, they deserved it. I did not personally feel it was a time to go maskless in a pool. It has been a tough time for everyone and for some people much more. I think gratitude and being thankful for privileges is what is most important to know versus throwing your privileges in people\u2019s faces,\u201d she said.\n\nShruti Haasan added that she never let her guard down even when the lockdown restrictions were relaxed after the first wave of COVID-19 subsided.\n\n\u201cI was really thankful to go back to work. There were some teams which were extremely responsible and careful. And then there was \u201cone\u201d basically that wasn\u2019t. And I never forgot that we are still in a pandemic. Now it is easy to say \u2018oh we\u2019re still in a pandemic\u2019. But, I knew this three months ago. People thought that I was crazy, a psycho aunty yelling all the time. I was always on the edge about it and I don\u2019t think many people appreciated it,\u201d the actor said.\n\nShruti Haasan was last seen in Pawan Kalyan\u2019s Vakeel Saab. She played Pawan\u2019s love interest in the film, which is the remake of Bollywood hit Pink. She is also waiting for the release of Laabam. And she is also part of Salaar, which stars Prabhas in the lead."}

While the world is running after numbers and adding megapixels to the cameras, OnePlus is unsettling the world of mobile photography by adding features to its cameras, showing the world what professional-level photography on a smartphone looks like.\n\nWhile OnePlus has left no stone unturned to make the OnePlus 9 Pro a flagship in every sense of the word (processor, display, design, battery), what is truly remarkable about it is its camera set up that not beats other smartphones hands down, but also lets it replace your professional camera.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nThe OnePlus 9 Pro comes with a quad-camera setup on the back which is led by a 48MP main sensor. This main camera is a massive 1/1.43 inch custom-built IMX789 sensor co-engineered by Sony and comes with a 2\u00d72 on-chip lens (OLC). Having such a huge sensor onboard allows the camera to absorb more light, resulting in more detail and better quality images. This large sensor is paired with a number of pro-grade features. It also supports 12-bit RAW, dual native ISO and DOL_HDR that allows the lens to hold much more colour information when compared to other lenses. The OnePlus 9 Pro also brings one of the fastest focusing speeds that one can get on a smartphone camera. Just one quick tap and the phone will instantly shift focus.\n\nIt is not just about stills. The sensor brings the same level of photography expertise to the video front as well. It features 16x the pixel count of standard 1080p for greater detail and clarity. While most of the world is stuck on 4K, this sensor allows you to shoot 8K videos at 30fps. 4K video recording also gets a boost, allowing users to capture 4K videos at a stunning 120fps. And the lights will not affect it much.\n\nThanks to DOL-HDR, the phone will deliver clear footage and the subject will stand out clearly even in backlit conditions. Nightscape 2.0 takes low light photography to another level, delivering surprisingly clear and detailed low light videos. The presence of optical image stabilisation (OIS) eliminate the chances of ending up with a blurry shot because of shaky hands, making capturing a moving subject (think people, pets, anything that moves) more fun and stress-free. Got a pet? Your gallery will be full of beautiful images of them because the OnePlus 9 Pro also comes with Cat and Dog Face Focus mode.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nAccompanying the main sensor is a 50MP ultrawide sensor. A Sony IMX766 sensor, it is 3.2 times bigger than the one on the iPhone 12 Pro Max at 1/1.56 inches. What\u2019s more, it comes with a Freeform Lens which is specifically designed to minimise the distortions at the edges of photos. The feature will ensure that when you are taking a picture of a beautiful landscape, the edges of it come out almost totally straight, giving you those pro-camera vibes. That\u2019s not all. To call this lens versatile would be such an understatement. The ultrawide camera can also be used to take close up shots. So you can use the same sensor to take in a scenery and then switch to taking macro shots of subjects from as close as 4cm. So you get the bigger picture AND the smaller picture, using the same lens. How cool is that?\n\nIncidentally, the camera delivers a massive 12 megapixel close up shot unlike most other smartphones that come with low-resolution sensors (2MP or 5MP) for macro photography. The same extraordinary performance extends to video as well. The 50MP ultrawide sensor can capture time lapse video, portrait videos, and comes with focus tracking which ensures the focus gets locked on your subject, no matter where it goes, as long as it stays in the frame.\n\nTo add to the already powerful camera set up, OnePlus has also added an 8MP telephoto lens. This sensor offers 3.3x optical zoom, allowing you to zoom in without losing detail. If you want to dive deeper and move even closer, it also offers a 30x digital zoom. Unlike many telephoto lenses on smartphones, this one comes with OIS which means a little shake will not result in blurry pictures. Finally, OnePlus has also not ignored our love for classic black and white. The brand has added a dedicated monochrome sensor that pairs up with the main sensor to deliver stunningly detailed monochrome images.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nWe saved the best for last. All this comes with expertise from one of the biggest names in the camera business. OnePlus has partnered with Hasselblad, the brand behind the first camera to have ever been on the moon, and the partnership aims to deliver photographs with colours as close to what is seen by the human eye as possible. OnePlus has used Hasselblad\u2019s Natural Colour Calibration system which delivers images with extremely realistic colours in both stills and videos.\n\nThe 12-bit RAW format on the phone captures 64 times as much colour as compared to the 10-bit RAW format that is present on most smartphone cameras. The Hasselblad effect is there in the camera interface as well. OnePlus is known for its clean, clutter-free UI and the brand has taken this one step further by using an interface based on Hasselblad\u2019s image processing software called Hasselblad Pro Mode. it is incredibly easy to use for casual users and for those who want to push their photography boundaries, the interface offers professional-level controls like the ability to customise ISO, exposure time, white balance and much more.\n\n//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\n\nThe OnePlus 9 Pro might be phone but its sensors put it right into the camera category \u2013 you get 8k video, telephoto zoom, an ultra-wide sensor with no curving on the edges, a macro sensor, a main sensor capable of taking 12-bit RAW images, and all the controls you would expect in a professional camera. And much more. All with the assurance of Hasselblad. Other phone cameras should feel unsettled. The OnePlus 9 pro delivers the pro photography experience that we have been so far missing from our smartphones. And that makes it a pro in the truest sense."}

A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, Saturday (Source: PTI)\n\nBruised and battered after suffering a hat-trick of defeats, a desperate Sunrisers Hyderabad would seek inspiration from skipper David Warner to arrest any further slide when they take on Punjab Kings in an IPL match on Wednesday.\n\nSRH couldn\u2019t have asked for a worse start to the season as they slumped to three straight defeats, and in all occasions while chasing.\n\nPunjab are a tad better than SRH, having registered one win out of three games to be placed at seventh in the standings, a rung above their Wednesday\u2019s opponents.\n\nChasing has been Sunrisers\u2019 achilles\u2019 heel so far in the league. They failed to get past a low score against Mumbai Indians in their last match.\n\nSRH have been hit hard by the lack of depth in their playing XI and below-par Indian bench strength.\n\nIn these circumstances, the onus rests on Warner to do some magic and inspire his side to bounce back in the tournament.\n\nA big innings is due from the SRH captain as he has scored just 93 runs from the three matches he has played so far with the 54 against Royals Challengers Bangalore being the highest.\n\nHe also needs some serious introspection before deciding his playing XI on Wednesday.\n\nWarner and Rashid Khan are certainties in the foreign players\u2019 slots, but the absence of Kane Williamson has been badly felt as he can provide solidity to the middle-order, especially after they faltered in three consecutive chases.\n\nGoing by Wridhhiman Saha\u2019s poor form, Jonny Bairstow is the frontrunner for the wicket-keeper\u2019s position.\n\nBut what would be troubling Warner most is the lack of depth in the team\u2019s local batting resources.\n\nIt\u2019s high time the likes of Manish Pandey, Vijay Shankar, Abhishek Sharma and Abdul Samad pulled up their socks as the likes of seasoned Kedar Jadhav and Priyam Garg are waiting in the wings for their opportunities.\n\nSRH have also been hit hard by the poor show of Bhuvneshwar Kumar and T Natarajan.\n\nNatarajan was replaced by Khaleel Ahmed in their last match and the latter did a good job to restrict Mumbai. But Bhuvneshwar continues to be on the expensive side.\n\nRashid has been economical but didn\u2019t look menacing so far.\n\nPunjab too are on a losing streak after the win in their tournament opener over Rajasthan Royals. They lost to Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals.\n\nAfter a batting collapse against CSK, Punjab made a significant improvement and rode on skipper KL Rahul (61) and Mayank Agarwal (69) fifties to post a challenging 195 for four against DC.\n\nBut a below-par effort from their bowlers spoiled the hardwork of the openers.\n\nMohammed Shami has not been in his best form so far and leaked runs but what would be a concern for KL Rahul is the performance of Australian pace duo of Jhye Richardson and Riley Meredith.\n\nBoth Richardson and Meredith were expensive in all the matches they played without much success and it is time for Rahul to think of other alternatives like Chris Jordan.\n\nYoung Arshdeep Singh has been impressive for Punjab.\n\nThe Teams:\n\nSRH: David Warner (C), Kane Williamson, Virat Singh, Manish Pandey, Priyam Garg, Wriddhiman Saha, Jonny Bairstow, Jason Roy, Sreevats Goswami, Vijay Shankar, Mohammad Nabi, Kedar Jadhav, J Suchit, Jason Holder, Abhishek Sharma, Abdul Samad, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Rashid Khan, T Natarajan, Sandeep Sharma, Khaleel Ahmed, Siddharth Kaul, Basil Thampi, Shahbaz Nadeem and Mujeeb ur Rahman.\n\nPunjab Kings: KL Rahul (c & wk), Mayank Agarwal, Chris Gayle, Mandeep Singh, Prabsimran Singh, Nicholas Pooran (wk), Sarfaraz Khan, Deepak Hooda, Murugan Ashwin, Ravi Bishnoi, Harpreet Brar, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ishan Porel, Darshan Nalkande, Chris Jordan, Dawid Malan, Jhye Richardson, Shahrukh Khan, Riley Meredith, Moises Henriques, Jalaj Saxena, Utkarsh Singh, Fabian Allen, Saurabh Kumar.\n\nMatch starts at 3:30 PM."}

The easy availability of such devices has posed a problem.

Such boosters work by drawing in all the available mobile signals in the area with low connectivity. The signal is then redistributed in small and concentrated clusters such as buildings or a small group of buildings.\n\nWhen telecom service providers install such signal boosters or wireless signal repeaters, they ensure that it does not in any way impact the network strength and coverage for people where the signal strength is good. Telcos also ensure that these repeaters do not interfere with their own spectrum and airwaves.\n\nOn the other hand, illegal boosters and mobile signal repeaters, telcos say, deplete the network strength by drawing in more than necessary airwaves and then redistribute it in a haphazard manner.\n\n\u201cThe concern is that, such wide band devices draw in network signals to provide connectivity to a particular building or area in an unregulated manner, thereby depleting the network strength in other surrounding areas and results into call drops and depleted network quality,\u201d the COAI said in its letter to Prakash."}

(PTI Photo)\n\nA week-on-week analysis of the last one month shows the weekly growth rate in new Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra has slowed last week, a possible effect of partial lockdown across the state, though public health professionals said it was too early to see this as a lasting trend.\n\nIn Mumbai, the weekly growth rate of cases between April 11-18 stood at 11 per cent, a drop from 14.9 per cent between April 4-11.\n\nMaharashtra\u2019s growth rate dipped marginally\u2014 from 13.1 per cent between April 4-11 to 12.6 cent between April 11-18. On Monday, the state recorded 58,924 fresh cases, and 351 deaths due to Covid-19. Mumbai recorded 7,381 cases and 58 deaths.\n\nDr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer, BMC, said it is still early to predict a trend. \u201cWe need to wait till this weekend to see if new cases continue to drop this week,\u201d she said, adding that the weekend drop in testing also leads to fewer cases every Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe decline in Mumbai cases, even if slight, comes almost a fortnight after partial lockdown was introduced.\n\nOn April 4, the state government introduced a slew of restrictions including shutdown of malls, restaurants, theatres, night curfews, and allowed only construction work, public transport, take-aways from restaurants and deliveries. On April 13, more restrictions were imposed, including weekend lockdowns, closure of all non-essential shops, shutdown of private offices, and only home delivery from restaurants and hotels.\n\nDr Rahul Pandit, member of the state task force, said it takes 10 days for the lockdown impact to be seen on new cases. Mumbai recorded 53,957 cases between March 28 to April 4, which rose to 67,817 between April 4-11 and dipped to 58,988 between April 11-18.\n\nWhile Mumbai has shown a decline in weekly new cases, Maharashtra has shown a rise in absolute numbers although its growth rate has slowed. State recorded 2.96 lakh cases between March 28-April 4, which rose to 3.96 lakh between April 4 to April 11 and further rose to 4.32 lakh in April 11-18 week. Its growth rate in same period rose from 10.9 to 13.1 percent and dipped slightly to 12.6 percent last week.\n\n\u201cThere may be a slight decrease, but we need to wait until April 25 to see if there is a dip in the number of critical patients to see the lockdown\u2019s impact. Generally it takes a few days for symptoms to surface and 7-8 days before ICU is needed. If cases are reducing, the impact on ICU cases will be seen in the next few days,\u201d Pandit said.\n\nHe added that even if the city continues to see a dip, testing must not be reduced. \u201cIf overall cases go down, we should increase testing in areas where there are clusters of cases or more cases are found,\u201d he said."}

Besides, mouth and nose, it has been found that the coronavirus can spread through the eyes too. A study, published in the Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology, determined that conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis can also be a symptom of COVID-19 besides the usual symptoms including fever, dry cough, and tiredness, aches and pains, sore throat, headache and loss of taste or smell.\n\nAccording to Dr Maurya, as per available data, only three per cent of people with COVID-19 will get conjunctivitis. \u201cWhen the virus infects a tissue called the conjunctiva, which covers the white part of our eye, inside of our eyelids, that results in conjunctivitis. Some of the other related symptoms are: the eyes become swollen and itchy. One may even have excessive tearing or increased eye secretion,\u201d said Dr Maurya.\n\nAcademic studies at the outset of the pandemic also identified conjunctivitis as a secondary symptom in about 10 to 15 per cent of Covid-19 cases.\n\nIf possible, we have to protect our eyes with glasses, instead of contact lenses.

We must stay very careful regarding any kind of uneasiness in our eyes, he added.\n\nFew tips for keeping eyes safe during the pandemic\n\n*We must avoid gathering, wear a mask always whenever in public and maintain social distancing\n\n*We need to wash our hands and eyes frequently\n\n*We have to avoid rubbing our eyes or touching our face frequently\n\n*If possible, we have to protect our eyes with glasses instead of contact lenses.\n\n*\u201dAs it is a challenging time for all of us, it\u2019s best not to take any risk and contact the doctor as soon as we start observing any symptoms. Without consulting the doctor, we should not use any eye drops or medicine as sometimes wrong medication may affect us adversely,\u201d he said.\n\nFor more lifestyle news, follow us: Twitter: lifestyle_ie | Facebook: IE Lifestyle | Instagram: ie_lifestyle"}
