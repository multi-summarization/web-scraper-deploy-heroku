The February numbers also entail a reversal of the falling trajectory of inflation from November 2020 to January this year. What does this mean for the larger macro economy? Here are four charts that put the latest inflation numbers in perspective.</p><p><strong>1. Non-food prices were rising for a while, only food prices reversed their trend now</strong></p><p>39% of India\u2019s CPI basket comprises of food items. This means that the headline inflation number is extremely sensitive to what is happening to food prices. The recent fall in headline inflation; it fell from 7.61% in October 2020 to 4.06% in January 2021, before rising to 5.03% in February, was largely a reflection of a moderation in food inflation, which fell sharply from 11% in October 2020 to just 1.96% in January 2021. </p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/factoryproductioncontracts-in-january-inflation-hits-3-month-high-101615585145232.html\" target=\"_blank\">Factory production contracts in January inflation hits 3-month high</a></p><p>Prices of non-food items never really moderated during this period. The non-food basket of CPI grew at 5.39% in October 2020, moderated slightly to 5.23% in November 2020 and has been rising steadily in the last three months to reach 5.78% in February 2021. The February 2021 value of non-food inflation is the highest since October 2018.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. What led to a rise in food inflation?</strong></p><p>The more important question is what didn\u2019t.</p><p>Prices of cereals and products, vegetables and sugar and condiments \u2014 these three sub-groups account for almost half of the CPI food basket \u2014 were lower in Feb 2021 than they were in Feb 2020. This is the first instance since Jan 2012, the earliest period for which data is available under the current CPI series, that inflation for cereals and products has entered negative territory. Vegetable prices continued to fall, albeit at a slower rate, largely because of a tightening in onion and tomato prices. The commodity group which has really experienced a sharp spike in its prices in Feb is the (edible) oils and fat category. At 20.78%, the inflation in this category is the highest ever since January 2012. This group is experiencing uninterrupted double-digit inflation since April 2020. Prices of pulses and meat, fish and eggs also grew in double digit in February, again a continuation of a long-term trend.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. What is triggering non-food inflation?</strong></p><p>There is more to it than fuel prices. Core-inflation, which measures the trajectory of the non-food non-fuel basket of CPI, grew at 5.99% in February 2021, the highest since July 2018.</p><p>A look at the broad sub-categories of inflation shows that it is clothing and footwear and the miscellaneous category under the CPI; the latter has the largest weight of 28.32% after food, which show an increase in February compared to the previous month. A further disaggregation shows that prices of almost everything in the miscellaneous category, except personal care and effects, gained momentum in February. Transport and communication, which accounts for almost 30% of this category, re-entered double digit inflation zone. This basically means that transporters are passing on the pain of rise in fuel prices to the consumers. The trend in prices of these items is in keeping with what experts such as Pranjul Bhandari, the chief India economist of HSBC Securities and Capital Markets, have been saying about the possibility of a revival in services inflation once the economy opened up.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. These are the broad inflation trends. But what does it mean for the economy?</strong></p><p>It is bad news for rural demand.</p><p>For three consecutive months now, prices of non-food items have been rising at a faster pace than food items. This entails a worsening of terms of trade \u2014 ratio of prices of receivables and payables \u2014 for the farmers. As has been discussed above, the headline food inflation numbers do not capture the true picture of farmer headwinds for farmer well-being.</p><p><strong>Also Read: </strong><a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/costly-food-higher-fuel-prices-take-retail-inflation-to-3-month-high-of-503-101615558947292.html\" target=\"_blank\">Costly food, higher fuel prices take retail inflation to 3-month high of 5.03%</a></p><p>Cereals, vegetables and sugar (cane); the three food groups which have experienced disinflation in February actually account for more than half of the value of output in Indian agriculture. Whereas food items which have seen an increase in prices have a smaller weight in the overall production basket and a large import content. Simply put, farmers who grow cereals, vegetables and sugarcane have to shell out more money for buying things from the market, while they are getting a lower price for what they are taking to sell to the market. This is bound to put a squeeze on their purchasing power and hence demand.</p><p>Farm incomes are not the only variable to get hit by the current rise in inflation. We have rural wage data till December 2020. Average rural wages came out of contraction zone after four consecutive months in December 2020. This was largely due to a moderation in inflation. A simple comparison of annual real and nominal wage growth in November and December 2020 brings this out. Whereas real rural wage increased by 3.2 percentage point during these two months, nominal wage growth increased by just quarter of a percentage point. If inflation were to reverse its falling trajectory, like it has in February, it could generate strong headwinds for rural wages, and therefore demand as well.</p><p><br></p><p>Obviously, rural demand will not be the only sector which will suffer because of growing inflation. There is a large consensus across the board that India\u2019s post-pandemic economic recovery has seen a tilting of scales in favour of capital and away from labour, or what many have called a profit-led recovery. Private estimates such as the one by Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy suggest that labour force participation rates, which measures the share of working age people who are working or looking for a job, have not come back to pre-pandemic levels. India is also facing the possibility of a second Covid-19 wave at the moment. This has the potential to disrupt supply chains and trigger inflation once again. The Indian economy also faces international tailwinds to inflation; commodity prices, especially of crude oil, have been rising and expected to either maintain course or not come down anytime soon, as advanced country economies gather momentum, thanks to stimulus packages and vaccines. All these have a potential of putting a squeeze on real incomes and therefore aggregate demand.</p>"}

Now it is facing flak over the death of businessman Mansukh Hiran, whose SUV was found outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani\u2019s home with explosives last month. Hiran\u2019s death came at a time was Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis in the Assembly said that the businessman needed to be protected, as he could throw some light on the case. The issue has become the latest headache for Uddhav Thackeray after Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze was arrested for his alleged involvement by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday night. </p><p>The Palghar lynching case, in which two seers and their driver were beaten to death, as well as Rajput\u2019s death, led to an uproar in social media over the state\u2019s handling of the cases, with Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) accusing MVA it of suppressing the facts. </p><p>While the government kept insisting that the probe in both the cases was being conducted in an impartial manner, it was the allegations against its two ministers that caused it major embarrassment. </p><p>Social justice minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dhananjay Munde, in the second week of January, faced allegations of rape by a budding Bollywood singer, who was also younger sister of a woman with whom the minister had admitted to be in a relationship. Though the singer later withdrew her complaint amid much political drama, the minister had almost lost his chair. A month later, Shiv Sena leader and forest minister Sanjay Rathod\u2019s name cropped up in a case related to the suicide of a 23-year-old Pune woman. About a dozen audio clips of the mobile conversation related to the case went viral with the Opposition alleging that one of the voices in the clips was that of Rathod. The minister had to resign from the cabinet on the eve of the budget session that started on March 1. </p><p>The 10-day long session ended under the shadow of the controversy over Vaze\u2019s alleged involvement in the explosives case, with Fadnavis alleging that the cop was directly connected to Hiran\u2019s death. Buckling under Opposition\u2019s pressure, the assistant police inspector was shunted out of the crime branch, though chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had defended him by saying that Vaze should not be \u201changed\u201d before the trial. Fadnavis had taunted Thackeray and said Vaze does not need any lawyer as CM has himself taken up the job to defend him. </p><p><b>Three cases in two months </b></p><p>The three cases \u2013 two pertaining to the ministers and Vaze \u2013 have damaged MVA government\u2019s image, according to its own ministers. The government faced many controversies during its 15-month tenure, but these two months are believed to be really troublesome for it, they said. </p><p>\u201cThe wounded BJP left no opportunity to corner the Thackeray government ever since it was formed on November 28, 2019, after the decades-long Sena-BJP alliance came to an end. Be it Rajput\u2019s death case, the Palghar lynching, handling of the Covid-19 pandemic or loan waiver, power bills, BJP leaders were very aggressive while raising the issues. </p><p>However, in Rathod and Vaze\u2019s cases, the Opposition succeeded in pushing the government to the wall. Deputy CM Ajit Pawar had to admit that it was the pressure from the Opposition that led to Vaze\u2019s transfer, said a senior NCP minister. </p><p>The minister said that Munde could save his ministership because of the political strategy adopted to turn around the perception against him. </p><p>\u201cAt one moment, NCP chief Sharad Pawar had admitted it to be a serious case, hinting that the minister will have to resign. But as more people, including a former legislator, coming to Munde\u2019s rescue by claiming that the woman had blackmailed them too, helped the minister save his chair.\u201d </p><p>Some behind-the-curtain damage control was reportedly done by NCP and Munde, which helped him retain his position. </p><p>However, Rathod\u2019s damage control management was poor, and getting linked in a woman\u2019s death case proved to be problematic for him. </p><p>Political analyst Hemant Desai said, \u201cThe immoral relations of politicians outside their wedlock are not accepted by women in the society. Women voters have been playing a major role in elections, as was seen in Bihar and other states. These two [ministers\u2019] cases may cost dear to ruling parties in the coming elections. The Vaze case was mishandled by the state government. There was no reason for CM to give loaded statements like \u2018Vaze can\u2019t be hanged before trial\u2019. Secondly, in Rathod and Vaze\u2019s cases, the action appeared to have been taken only after Pawar\u2019s intervention. This has been creating a poor picture for Thackeray, who is behind the steering wheel.\u201d </p><p>Shiv Sena\u2019s south Mumbai parliamentarian Arvind Sawant said: \u201cI do not think the MVA government has suffered any setback because of these cases. There have been more serious cases in the country, be it Karnataka minister\u2019s latest sex scandal or Hathras-Unnao cases in Uttar Pradesh. Rathod and Munde\u2019s cases are their personal matters. In Vaze\u2019s case, NIA is conducting a probe. Let the truth come to the fore and action will be taken. Also, why are questions not raised on [MP] Mohan Delkar\u2019s suicide, which is a more serious case? We should also remember that there was ruckus created in Rajput\u2019s death case, but the CBI found nothing.\u201d </p><p>State minority affairs minister from NCP Nawab Malik said Munde\u2019s case was a family matter and it had nothing to do with public perception. \u201cThe case was withdrawn by the complainant. In Rathod and Vaze\u2019s cases, the investigations are on, and truth will come to the fore once the probes are completed. In a democracy, the Opposition has its own importance, but Vaze\u2019s transfer was not because of the Opposition\u2019s pressure.\u201d </p><p><b>Poor handling, lack of coordination </b></p><p>Insiders said that the major difference between cases related to Munde and Rathod was their handling and that the former forest minister\u2019s case was an example of the poor crisis management by the ruling parties. Leaders from the ruling alliance said that Munde responded to the allegations within hours and ensured that the charges were withdrawn in the next few days. </p><p>\u201cOn the contrary, Rathod sulked for two weeks after the controversy broke out and emerged only to commit another mistake by gathering a huge crowd at Poharadevi temple [a religious place of his Banjara community] when his party chief and CM Thackeray had banned social gatherings. BJP raked up the issue in these two weeks to a level that the general perception went against the government, said a former Sena minister.</p><p>The three ruling parties are also not found to be on the same page on many occasions, and it was made evident during Vaze\u2019s case. </p><p>When Fadnavis levelled allegations of Vaze\u2019s involvement in Hiran\u2019s case on Tuesday, NCP leaders had initially agreed for Vaze\u2019s transfer, but the CM put his foot down and refused any action against the officer. This led to several adjournments in the Assembly and pandemonium. The house proceedings resumed only after the government announced Vaze\u2019s transfer. </p><p>Insiders feel that the criticism and controversy could have been avoided had the officer been shunted out immediately after the issue came up. </p><p>\u201cThe ruling parties, in retaliation, raised the suicides cases of interior designer Anvay Naik and Delkar, who was Dadra and Nagar Haveli MP. In the 2018 Naik case, the victim\u2019s family had blamed the Fadnavis government of suppressing the case, while Delkar had named a BJP leader from Gujarat, holding him responsible for the suicide. This may have helped us in pushing BJP on the back foot, but the seriousness of the Hiran case does not recede,\u201d the former Sena minister said. </p><p>The leader said that ruling parties fail to pre-empt the controversies and plan accordingly. </p><p>\u201cBJP has an edge over us in picking up the issues. They miss no time in strategising and attacking the government. Be it Palghar lynching, Rajput or Rathod\u2019s cases, the Opposition has always been aggressive. But the over-aggressive approach seems to going against them, and is playing as an advantage of the MVA government,\u201d he said. </p><p>The Congress, the third MVA partner, has distanced itself from all these issues to avoid any embarrassment. A Congress leader said that the damage to MVA\u2019s image is unlikely to be reflected as there are no major elections anytime soon. </p><p>\u201cMoreover, these cases are mostly related to the other two ruling parties. By maintaining distance, we made sure that they directly do not hamper us,\u201d the leader said. </p><p>Malik said that the ruling parties will take more precautions for better coordination in future. </p><p>\u201cSome of the issues such as the one related to Rathod are to be tackled at the party level as it\u2019s their internal matter. But yes, when it comes to MVA, we need to have better coordination in future,\u201d he said. </p><p>Maharashtra BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, \u201cWe have been raising issues of public interest from beginning, be it Palghar lynching, SSR death or but till then the general public had sympathy for this government. Now, the people have realised the failure of the MVA government. They have realised that people here are not safe and the government is not interested at all to ensure it. Vaze\u2019s is not the only case to establish that the law and order in the state has completely collapsed.\u201d</p>"}

By providing real-time information to commuters about multiple public transport modes at bus stops, railway stations and public bicycle sharing stations, integration can be achieved,\u201d said Sharma.</p><p>\u201cCycle tracks should be set up in such a manner that they are well connected with work, entertainment, commercial and green areas, so that cyclists have a facility for smooth/easy/safe access to above spaces,\u201d reads the draft.</p>"}
