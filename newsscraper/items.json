AstraZeneca also said it had found no evidence of increased risk of deep-vein thrombosis.\n\nIrish authorities received some reports of clotting similar to those seen in Europe last week but nothing as serious as the cases in Norway, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Ronan Glynn said.\n\nGlynn said the fact that the Norwegian cases related to a cluster of four unusual clotting events involving the brain in 30 to 40 year-olds raised the higher level of concern.\n\nHe said that one of the reasons Ireland acted now was that it was due to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine to people of a similar age with serious underlying conditions next week.\n\n\"It may be nothing, we may be overreacting and I sincerely hope that in a week's time that we will have been accused of being overly-cautious,\" Glynn told national broadcaster RTE.\n\n\"Hopefully we will have data to reassure us in a few short days and we will be back up and running with this.\"\n\nAstraZeneca vaccinations make up 20% of the 590,000 shots administered among Ireland's 4.9 million population, mainly to healthcare workers after its use was not initially recommended for those over 70 and the firm supplied far fewer vaccines to the European Union than agreed.\n\nThere have been 4,534 COVID-19-related deaths in Ireland. The number of cases per 100,000 people in the past 14 days fell to 155 from a high of over 1,500 in January, although officials are concerned over a slight rise in new cases in recent days.\n\nNorthern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill also raised concerns over the suspension of AstraZeneca elsewhere. The region's assistant director of public health, Stephen Bergin, said the vaccine's rollout will continue.\n\nLike the rest of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland is much further ahead in its programme and has inoculated more than 40% of the adult population, relying heavily on AstraZeneca's vaccine.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"}

According to the alliance deal, the actor-politician's party will contest 60 of the state's 234 seats.\n\n\n\nAMMK, in a statement, said it will withdraw its candidates from the seats allotted to DMDK.\n\nDMDK has released its first list of candidates. Vijayakanth's wife Premalatha will contest from Virudhachalam, whereas ex-MLA P Parthasarathy will contest from Virugambakkam.\n\nThe ruling AIADMK has allotted 23 seats to Anbumani Ramadoss' PMK.

But the court heard that those weapons were never recovered.\n\nIt was with the assistance of witnesses and piecing together CCTV that officers were able to trace and arrest the suspects, who were subsequently charged with murder, the Met Police said.\n\nAll four convicted of the killing will be sentenced at Croydon Crown Court at a later date.\n\n(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)"}

But the answer to it is neither complex nor new. Indeed, that answer is even older than the Petition: the solution is from 1905.

He has visited five times, but has been unable to generate any wave,\" Ajmal claimed.\n\n\"By showing my face, by portraying Muslims as enemies, and making communal comments, the BJP wants to polarise Hindus, but unlike last time, they will not succeed,\" he said.\n\nOn its tie-up with the Congress and forming the ''Mahajot'' alliance, the Lok Sabha MP from Dhubri said after seeing that wherever opposition parties were coming together along with the Congress, results were good, his party decided to forge the alliance.\n\n\"I have been a part of the UPA for the last 15 years at the Centre, so it was important that we come together. Some people were not allowing it. But things fell in place. The Congress high command also gave the green signal and a grand alliance of seven parties has been formed, and we are confident of succeeding,\" Mr Ajmal said.\n\nThere is a wave against the BJP and that will benefit the grand alliance, he added.\n\nOn the recent controversy surrounding a \"doctored\" video of his doing the rounds on social media, Ajmal alleged that the BJP doesn''t have anything to say against his party so they are coming up with such tactics.\n\nWith the AIUDF expected to fight on 21 seats as part of the grand alliance headed by Congress, Ajmal said it could have contested 30-31 seats but decided to sacrifice for the sake of the alliance to prevent a division of opposition votes.\n\n\"Earlier, we lost seats between our party and the Congress. So, we thought that let us sacrifice this time but prevent a division of votes. We agreed to take fewer seats, but we expect to win 90-95 per cent of the seats we are contesting,\" he said, adding that the grand alliance taking on the ruling BJP will get a majority in the Assam polls.\n\nOn BJP leader and state minister Himanta Biswa Sarma''s repeated attacks on him and invoking the erstwhile Mughal rule, Ajmal said, \"He (Sarma) has lost it. He had done good work under the Congress, but now after going to the BJP he is talking completely opposite of what he earlier said.\"\n\nThe BJP doesn't have anything else to say, so it is using \"Badruddin Ajmal''s face, calling me a Mughal. What do I have to do with the Mughals?\" the AIUDF chief said.\n\n\"Sarma has no developmental issue to talk about on which he can create a miracle. So, he is attacking me thinking that by doing so they can polarise votes,\" he said.\n\nThe BJP has not been able to fulfil the promises made to the people and is lying continuously, he alleged, asserting that people's memories are not so weak that they can be duped easily.\n\nThe AIUDF and the Congress are contesting the forthcoming polls as a part of the ''Grand Alliance'' along with the Bodoland People''s Front (BPF), CPI(M), CPI, CPI-ML and the Anchalik Gana Morcha.\n\nElections to the 126-member Assam assembly will be held in three phases on March 27, April 1 and April 6."}

Today marks the 14th anniversary of the police firing incident there in which several villagers died protesting against land acquisition by the then Communist party-led government. The Trinamool Congress chief built on the momentum gathered from that movement to go on to topple the long-standing Leftist regime of the state in 2011.\n\n\"Those who have given promotion to officers responsible for police firing have no right to observe 'Nandigram Divas'.

He rhetorically vowed to quit politics if he was unable to beat by 50,000 votes his former boss, Ms Banerjee, who, too, is now contesting from there.\n\nMr Adhikari won the seat in 2016 as a Trinamool candidate with over 67 per cent of the votes.

It had taken place suddenly\", the source said quoting the report.\n\nAbout the injury to Ms Banerjee, who is the Trinamool Congress (TMC) chief, in the incident, the report said that \"the suddenness of the incident\" led to it. \"There was no conspiracy behind the incident.\"\n\nThe report took into account the details provided by eye witnesses present during the incident as well as the video grabs collected from them.\n\nIt also referred to the failure of the police personnel in-charge of the chief minister's security detail in controlling the crowd which came \"too close\" to her.\n\n\"The local police and Chief Minister's security failed to control the crowd and that led to the untoward situation,\" the source said referring to the report.\n\nFollowing the Nandigram incident, state Additional Director General (ADG) of police (Law and Order) and nodal officer Jagmohan on Saturday directed all district administrations to arrange for strictest security measures for the chief minister during her campaign tours in the districts for the eight-phase poll beginning on March 27.\n\n\"Security measures should be stringent for the Chief Minister.

He was taken into custody late last night at the end of around 12 hours of questioning at the agency's office in the state capital. He was brought to the premise again this morning.\n\nLater, he presented before an NIA special court which remanded him to custody till March 25.\n\nOther officials of the Mumbai police's Crime Intelligence Unit, which was till last week headed by Mr Vaze, too, were called in by the NIA. today He was on Wednesday moved out from CIU to the Citizen Facilitation Centre (CFC).\n\nMr Vaze is also under probe by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) in connection with two other related cases: The first involving the death of Mansukh Hiran, a Thane-based businessman to whom the car found on Mumbai's Carmichael Road on February 25 was traced. The second pertains to the same vehicle's theft as reported on February 17 by the auto parts dealer. The officer had allegedly borrowed the SUV for around four months till he returned it on February 5, according to Mr Hiran's wife who also alleged his involvement in her husband's death.\n\nReferring to the arrest, the Shiv Sena's Sanjay Raut backed Mr Vaze and said that there was no need for the NIA to get involved in the matter.\n\n\"I believe Sachin Waze is a very honest and capable officer. He has been arrested in connection with gelatin sticks that were found. One suspicious death also occurred. It's Mumbai Police's responsibility to investigate the matter. No central team was needed,\" Mr Raut told ANI.\n\nHe said the repeated interference by Central agencies demoralises the Mumbai police and \"creates instability\".\n\n\"We respect NIA but our police could've done it too. Mumbai Police and ATS are well respected but central agencies repeatedly enter Mumbai and demoralise Mumbai Police. It creates instability in the state and creates pressure on Mumbai police and administration,\" he said.\n\nOn Friday, Mr Vaze had filed an anticipatory bail plea at the Thane district sessions court and sought interim protection from arrest, terming the case against him \"baseless\" and a \"witch-hunt\". His plea for interim protection was rejected, with the court observing that his custodial interrogation was necessary. A hearing on his bail plea is now scheduled for March 19. The NIA then summoned him to its office yesterday where the ATS, too, joined in later.\n\nA day before Mr Vaze was moved to CFC at the police headquarters on Wednesday, former Maharashtra Chief Minister and leader of the opposition, Devendra Fadnavis, had sought his arrest. Following his transfer, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said, \"Sachin Vaze is not Osama Bin Laden. It is not right to target a person and hang him and then investigate.\"\n\nThe BJP today demanded that Mr Vaze be subjected to narco-analysis and alleged that the Uddhav Thackeray government was openly trying to protect him. Mr Vaze had, during an earlier period of suspension from service, joined the Shiv Sena which heads the state's Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi dispensation now.\n\n\"Is the government worried that if Sachin Vaze is questioned, the probe will reach the government with new revelations?\" state BJP spokesperson Ram Kadam asked today in a letter to Chief Minister Thackeray. \"Will the Maharashtra government have the courage to subject Sachin Vaze to a narco-test?\"\n\nThe explosives-laden Mahindra Scorpio was found near Mr Ambani's south Mumbai residence with a threat letter inside. The police traced the vehicle back to Mr Hiran, but he claimed it was stolen a week earlier. The case got murkier when the Thane-based trader himself was found dead in a creek near Mumbra town on March 5.\n\nMeanwhile, a message claiming responsibility for placing the vehicle was posted on Telegram late on February 27 night. It demanded a ransom in cryptocurrency, according to the police. The Telegram channel was later traced to a barrack in Delhi's Tihar jail where Indian Mujahideen terrorist Tehseen Akhtar is housed, police sources told NDTV."}

The Trinamool Congress repeated the allegations of conspiracy in its memorandum to the Election Commission. Whether the door was intentionally slammed or accidentally is now a hot button political debate.\n\nThe BJP has been accusing Ms Banerjee of feigning an attack to gain public sympathy in a losing battle ahead of state elections.\n\nMs Banerjee sustained \"severe bone injuries\" on her left foot and ankle as well as bruises and injuries on her shoulder, forearm and neck, according to the report of her initial medical examination.

The party alleged a \"nexus\" between the BJP's complaints against the sacked police chief and the police being absent at the time of the incident.\n\nOn Friday, as Ms Banerjee was discharged, the medical board of the SSKM Hospital in Kolkata told reporters: \"Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has responded well to the treatment. The six-member board has re-examined her health condition. We have opened the plaster cast. Fresh plaster has been applied. She has been discharged with appropriate instructions, after her repeated requests. She has been advised to revisit after seven days.\"\n\nMs Banerjee will contest against former aide Suvendu Adhikari, who is now with the BJP, in Nandigram.\n\nBengal will vote in eight rounds starting March 27 and the results will be declared on May 2."}

With millions displaced and hundreds of thousands killed, the Indo-Pacific region sounded a clarion call for help. Together, our four countries answered it.\n\nAustralia, India, Japan and the United States - a group of democratic nations dedicated to delivering results through practical cooperation - coordinated rapid humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to people in need. Our cooperation, known as \"the Quad,\" was born in crisis. It became a diplomatic dialogue in 2007 and was reborn in 2017.\n\nNow, in this new age of interconnection and opportunity throughout the Indo-Pacific, we are again summoned to act together in support of a region in need.\n\nSince the tsunami, climate change has grown more perilous, new technologies have revolutionized our daily lives, geopolitics have become ever more complex, and a pandemic has devastated the world. Against this backdrop, we are recommitting to a shared vision for an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, resilient and inclusive. We are striving to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is accessible and dynamic, governed by international law and bedrock principles such as freedom of navigation and peaceful resolution of disputes, and that all countries are able to make their own political choices, free from coercion. In recent years, that vision has increasingly been tested. Those trials have only strengthened our resolve to reckon with the most urgent of global challenges together.\n\nOur governments have worked closely for years, and Friday, for the first time in \"Quad\" history, we convened as leaders to advance meaningful cooperation at the highest level. To strengthen our quest for a region that is open and free, we have agreed to partner to address the challenges presented by new technologies and collaborate to set the norms and standards that govern the innovations of the future. It is clear that climate change is both a strategic priority and an urgent global challenge, including for the Indo-Pacific region. That's why we will work together and with others to strengthen the Paris agreement, and enhance the climate actions of all nations. And with an unwavering commitment to the health and safety of our people, we are determined to end the covid-19 pandemic because no country will be safe so long as the pandemic continues.\n\nThe pandemic is among the greatest risks to health and economic stability in recent history, and we must work in partnership to stop it in its tracks. Now, we are launching an ambitious effort to help end covid-19. Together, we pledge to expand and accelerate production in India of safe, accessible and effective vaccines. We will partner at each stage to ensure that vaccines are administered throughout the Indo-Pacific region into 2022. We will combine our scientific ingenuity, financing, formidable productive capacity and long history of global-health partnership to surge the supply of life-saving vaccines, in close collaboration with multilateral organizations including the World Health Organization and Covax Facility. Our vaccine initiative will be guided by a Quad Vaccine Experts Working Group that brings together the sharpest scientific leaders from Australia, India, Japan and the United States to meet the region's pressing needs. And though the pandemic prevents us from meeting in person, we will do so before the end of 2021. The promises we make today must translate into a healthier and more prosperous Indo-Pacific tomorrow.\n\nWe are proud to announce these bold steps - and eager to begin the work our countries must undertake to achieve them. Ending and recovering from the pandemic, standing up to climate change, and advancing our shared regional vision will not be easy. We know we cannot and will not succeed without coordination and cooperation. We will renew and strengthen our partnerships in Southeast Asia, starting with the Association for Southeast Asian Nations, work with the Pacific Islands, and engage the Indian Ocean region to meet this moment. The Quad is a flexible group of like-minded partners dedicated to advancing a common vision and to ensuring peace and prosperity. We welcome and will seek opportunities to work with all of those who share in those goals.\n\nOver the course of these past months, each of us has grieved the suffering that our people and the world have endured. But in this dark hour, our partnership offers a spark of hope to light the path ahead. Our foundations of democracy and a commitment to engagement unite us. We know we can provide for the safety and prosperity of our people at home by confronting global crises together, with purpose and resolve. We summon from tragedy the strength and resilience to unify and overcome. And we recommit ourselves, once again, to an Indo-Pacific region that is free, open, secure and prosperous.\n\n(Joe Biden is president of the United States. Narendra Modi is prime minister of India.

They should have reached agreement.\"\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer called the scenes \"deeply disturbing\" and also criticised the way the vigil was policed.\n\nCaroline Nokes, the conservative chair of the women and equalities committee, said she was \"truly shocked at the scenes from Clapham Common - in this country we police by consent, not by trampling the tributes and dragging women to the ground\".\n\nAnd feminist direct action group Sister's Uncut tweeted late Saturday that \"Metropolitan police officers waited for the sun to set before they started grabbing and manhandling women in the crowd.\"\n\n\"Unbearable pain\"\n\nWayne Couzens, 48, appeared in court earlier on Saturday charged with kidnap and murder following his arrest at his home in Kent, southeast England. The victim's body was discovered in a nearby wood.\n\nMany more joined in a virtual tribute, including prime minister Boris Johnson and his partner, who lit a candle for Everard.\n\n\"I cannot imagine how unbearable their pain and grief is. We must work fast to find all the answers to this horrifying crime,\" he tweeted.\n\n\"I will do everything I can to make sure the streets are safe and ensure women and girls do not face harassment or abuse.\"\n\nOrganisers of the vigil said they hoped to raise 320,000 pounds ($445,000) for women's causes.\n\nEarlier on Saturday Prince William's wife Kate visited the bandstand at Clapham Common, which has turned into a shrine for the victim.\n\nEverard had visited friends in Clapham and was returning home to Brixton, about 50 minutes walk away, when she disappeared around 9:30 pm.\n\nThe case has caused a political fallout, with MP Jess Phillips this week reading out the names of 118 women murdered last year.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}

(Representational)\n\nAuthorities in White Plains, N.Y., arrested a suspect they say spit on and punched an 83-year-old Korean American woman on a busy street in the New York City suburb this week, marking the latest high-profile case in a spate of violence targeting Asian Americans nationwide.\n\nThe victim was walking alone near a shopping center Tuesday evening when police say Glenmore Nembhard, 40, attacked her without provocation, striking her so hard that she hit her head on the ground and blacked out. When she regained consciousness, the suspect was gone, according to police.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how investigators identified Nembhard as the suspect, but police said they arrested him early Thursday morning in the vicinity of the attack. He was charged with second-degree assault on a person 65 or older, a felony that carries up to seven years in prison. Police described him as homeless, and court records show he has been arrested by White Plains officers on at least four other occasions in the past year.\n\nOfficials have not commented on what role race may have played in the attack, but Westchester District Attorney Miriam Rocah said her office was investigating whether the beating constituted a hate crime.\n\n\"Attacks like this one impact all of us. They create an atmosphere of fear and intimidation that keeps us from feeling safe and secure in our homes and communities,\" Rocah said in a statement. \"I urge everyone to report all hate crimes and bias incidents, even if you are not the victim, so that law enforcement can track and work to prevent these terrible acts.\"\n\nAttorneys representing Nembhard didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday.\n\nA wave of racist violence and harassment has shaken Asian American communities from coast to coast in recent months, prompting some residents to organize neighborhood watch patrols and launch campaigns urging officials to crack down.\n\nA report this week by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University at San Bernardino, found that anti-Asian hate crimes jumped nearly 150% in the country's largest cities last year, even as overall hate crimes fell 7%. In New York City, there were 28 reported hate crimes against Asians last year, up from three in 2019, according to the study.\n\nActivists say the violence is linked at least in part to anti-Asian sentiment stoked by former president Donald Trump and other leaders who have spread misinformation about the coronavirus. The reported attacks are likely an undercount, activists say, with language and cultural barriers deterring some victims from seeking help from police.\n\nPresident Joe Biden denounced violence against Asian Americans in his prime-time address Thursday, saying that members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community have been \"attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated.\"\n\n\"So many of them are fellow Americans. They're on the front lines of this pandemic, trying to save lives,\" he said. \"And still, still, they're forced to live in fear for their lives, just walking down streets in America. It's wrong. It's un-American, and it must stop.\"\n\nSpeaking to a local ABC affiliate, the victim in the White Plains attack said she was collecting bottles and cans to trade in for cash when she was attacked outside a Nordstrom store at the Westchester Mall. She said that although she was left bleeding, she didn't go to the hospital because she was worried about the medical bills.\n\nHer daughter told the station that the incident shocked the family. \"Now I'm afraid to go out, and my kid is afraid to go out,\" she said.\n\nThe attack appeared to be the first reported physical assault on an Asian American in Westchester County since activists started tracking the spike in violence, according to Robert Chao, an executive with the local branch of the civil rights group OCA Asian Pacific American Advocates.\n\nChao said his organization learned of the incident Friday morning. It immediately alerted the coordinator from the district attorney's hate crime group and the Westchester County Human Rights Commission.\n\nChao said he's pleased with the support from the local government so far, but stressed that the attack was an important reminder for the community to be vigilant.\n\n\"We need to let people know what they should do if this happens to them,\" he said. \"This is about awareness. I just want more people to speak up, keep their eyes out to protect their neighbors.\"\n\nThe incident mirrored other attacks on Asian Americans over 65 in recent weeks, reviving concerns that attackers prey on elderly people.\n\nIn January, Vicha Ratanapakdee was taking his regular morning walk through San Francisco's Anza Vista neighborhood when a suspect shoved him to the ground, causing him to lose consciousness. The 84-year-old, who was recovering from heart surgery, died days later. A 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to murder in the attack.\n\nJust weeks later, 75-year-old Pak Ho was strolling through a residential neighborhood in Oakland when a suspect shoved him to the ground and robbed him. He died of his injuries on Thursday.\n\nIn response to the violence, California lawmakers passed legislation allocating $1.4 million to help Asian Americans report hate incidents. The bill, approved late last month, will assist researchers at the Asian American Studies Center and other groups collecting data on violence and discrimination against Asian Americans.\n\nMeera Venugopal, associate director of development and communications at the Asian American Federation, said the attack in White Plains underscored the need for New York lawmakers to take similar measures to protect Asian Americans in the state.\n\n\"I'd love to see our legislators step up and meet the demand. This is now a time for people to say, 'We empathize, we stand with you,' \" she said. \"Look at the bold steps California took. I think New York needs to do the same.\"\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}

BJP ka nasha utar gaya hai (BJP's intoxication has ended) They have failed to deliver promises,\" said Mr Baghel.\n\nThe Chhattisgarh Chief Minister claimed that BJP is confused and Assam is going to slip out of their hands.\n\n\"They (BJP) don't have any agenda. They should first decide whether Sarbananda Sonowal or Dr Himanta Biswa Sarma has been the Chief Minister for the last five years in Assam. BJP is confused and Assam is going to slip out of their hands,\" the Congress leader stated.\n\nThe first phase nominations have been completed in Assam, and nominations for the second phase are now in full swing. All political parties have entered the electoral arena depending on their respective strategy.\n\nThe term of the 14th legislative assembly of Assam is up to 31 May 2021. The Assembly elections for 126 seats will be held in three phases starting from March 27. In 2016 Assembly polls were held in two phases.\n\nIn 2016, the BJP scripted history and formed the government for the first time in the state ending Congress's 15-year rule. BJP and its allies Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and Bodoland People's Front (BPF) won a combined 86 seats in the 126-member Assam Assembly. BJP bagged 60 seats, AGP 14 and BPF 12 seats. Congress, which ran the state for three straight terms under the leadership of Tarun Gogoi, could manage to win only 26 seats.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, BJP won nine of the 14 parliamentary seats while its allies the AGP and the BPF drew a blank. On the other hand, Congress bagged three seats and the AIUDF and an independent won one seat each.\n\nEarlier in January, the Assam Congress unit had announced that five political parties including Congress, All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), Communist Party of India (CPI), CPI(Marxist), CPI(Marxist-Leninist) and Anchalik Gana Morcha would contest the state Assembly polls together to oust the Sonowal government from power.\n\nThe BJP is relying heavily on central leadership to return to power again in the state. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, BJP chief JP Nadda visited the state and addressed the huge gatherings in different parts of the state.\n\nAssam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal is pushing the issue of insurgency in the state and has said that his government is working to make Assam a terror-free state. Five groups of Karbi Anglong surrendered in front of Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal at a function in Guwahati on February 23, ahead of the state's assembly elections. The development comes a year after the Modi government signed the Bodo peace accord -- bringing an end to tPM he long violent movement for a separate Bodoland.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}

If this is how they want to run the House, then the opposition will be left with no choice but to boycott the proceedings.\"\n\nHe also alleged that the opposition was being throttled since the issue involved a minister from the BJP \"before which Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is helpless\".\n\nEarlier, soon after the commencement of proceedings at 11 am, Mr Yadav had sought to draw attention of the Chair to an adjournment motion moved by an RJD MLA, which the Speaker said would be raised at \"the appropriate time\".\n\nOpposition leaders walked out in protest, but returned at noon when the Zero Hour began, and the legislator Rekha Devi's motion was rejected though she was allowed to read out the draft.\n\nBy the time the House re-assembled at around 3:30 PM, the dust seemed to have settled down and members from the treasury benches as well as the opposition expressed regret over the ugly turn of events.\n\nMinister for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Kumar Chaudhary came out with a conciliatory speech and also assured the House \"the government has no intention to dictate terms to the Chair\".\n\nMr Yadav started off, before leaving for the assembly, with a press conference at his residence where he came out with documents and photographs to establish that Mr Rai was actively involved in matters of the school where liquor had been recovered and hence could be held accountable.\n\nThe minister, who holds revenue and land reforms portfolio, did not speak inside the House but addressed a press conference in the afternoon, ostensibly to present his \"report card\" upon completing 100 days of his tenure.\n\nHe said: \"Tejashwi Yadav's father (Lalu Prasad) must be aware of the credentials of my late father Arjun Rai after whom the school is named. The property belongs to a brother of mine.

The strong collaboration we have seen between the UK and India in responding across the world, including through the COVAX facility which is helping the more vulnerable countries in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"Equally, we are looking forward to further cooperation with India in its tenure as a Security Council member. Environment and climate change, healthcare, technology - the relationship between the UK and India is an important one across all these sectors and more,\" he added.\n\nLord Ahmad's visit kicks off with ministerial meetings in Delhi and then covers Chandigarh, Chennai and Hyderabad before he flies back to the UK following trade and investment talks in Mumbai.\n\nThe minister said the tour would very much be \"touching upon the important matters\" of the planning for the visit of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which is expected in the coming weeks to finalise the much-anticipated UK-India Enhanced Trade Partnership.\n\nMr Johnson's visit to India is set to be followed up by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the UK in June for the G7 Summit in Cornwall, where India is one of the guest countries invited by host-nation Britain.\n\n\"My very intensive and full programme reflects the incredible diversity that is India, and all its fantastic and incredible states and reflects the wide nature of the relationship and the bilateral engagement we have with one of our close partners,\" said the minister, whose father's roots trace back to Punjab and mother's to Rajasthan.\n\nThe visit will also coincide with the release of the UK's major foreign policy statement in the form of an Integrated Review next week, which is widely expected to confirm Britain's decisive Indo-Pacific tilt in a post-Brexit era.\n\n\"It can be taken as read in as much as government policy is concerned, there is a very strong belief and focus on the Indo-Pacific tilt and it's right we do so. When you look at the countries within that part of the region, India is foremost in our minds,\" Mr Ahmad said.\n\nThough the visit comes against the backdrop of a UK parliamentary committee room debate on the issue of farmers' protests against India's agricultural reforms earlier this week, the minister ruled out the issue in any way overshadowing his itinerary because the British government''s longstanding stance on the matter has been clear.\n\n\"We've always been consistently clear on matters such as these protests, it''s an internal matter,\" he said.\n\nIndia had strongly reacted to the debate as \"gross interference in the politics of another democratic country\", after which foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla had even summoned British High Commissioner to the UK Alex Ellis, a meeting Lord Ahmad described as \"very cordial\".\n\n\"Our position as a government is that the protests have been taking place for several months now and India as a democracy has totally guaranteed and secured the right to protest, which we fully acknowledge. There have been occasions where people have sought to disrupt those protests and that should be dealt with in accordance with the rule of law,\" he said.\n\nFarmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at several Delhi border points, including Tikri, Singhu and Ghazipur, since November 28, demanding a complete repeal of the three farm laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price for their crops."}

We fight alongside those actively silenced by the masses and portrayed as 'voiceless', because it is easier for savarnas to call them voiceless. We take the easy way out and fund saviourism rather than amplify the voices on ground,\" she said.\n\nWhile expressing gratitude to those who supported her, the activist said she was concerned about \"all those still in jail whose stories are not marketable\" and \"the marginalized that are not worthy of your screen time\".\n\nCharged with sedition for her alleged role in the creation of an online \"toolkit\" that police said contained action plans used to foment violence during the farmers' protest, Disha Ravi was freed on February 23 by the court which said, \"Sedition cannot be invoked to minister to the wounded vanity of the government.\"\n\nThe judge said he did not find Ms Ravi's link to the toolkit or a Canada-based group called the Poetic Justice Foundation (PJF) objectionable.\n\nThe toolkit, which offered basic advice on joining the farmers' protest on the ground and information on how to show support on social media, had been shared by Swedish climate crusader Greta Thunberg. Ms Ravi is a founder of the local chapter of Ms Thunberg movement.\n\nRead her full statement here:\n\nAll that is real feels far too unreal: Delhi's infamous smog; the cyber police station; Deen Dayal Hospital; Patiala House Court; and Tihar Jail.

As I stood in that courtroom, desperately searching for my lawyers, I came to terms with the fact that I would have to defend myself. I had no idea whether there was legal assistance available so when the judge asked me if I have anything to say, I decided to speak my mind. Before I knew it, I was sent to 5 days in police custody.\n\nIt's no surprise that in the days that followed, my autonomy was violated; my photographs were splashed all over the news; my actions were pronounced guilty - not in the court of law, but on flat screens by seekers of TRPs. I sat there, unaware of the many abstractions made of me in order to satiate their idea of me.\n\nAt the end of the five days (19 February 2021), I was shifted to Judicial Custody for 3 days. In Tihar, I was aware of every second of every minute of every hour of every day. Locked in my cell, I wondered when it became a crime to think the most basic elements of sustenance on this planet were as much mine as theirs. Why were millions paying the ultimate price for the greed of a few hundred? Their interest in the lives of those millions is dependent on whether or not they profit and even that interest has a short shelf-life. Unfortunately, so does humanity, if we do not act in time to stop this endless consumption and greed. We are inching closer to our own expiry\n\nI also realized, during my time in custody, that most people knew little or nothing about climate activism or climate justice. My grandparents, who are farmers, indirectly birthed my climate activism. I had to bear witness to how the water crisis affected them, but my work was reduced to tree plantation drives and clean-ups which are important but not the same as struggling for survival. Climate Justice is about intersectional equity. It is about being radically inclusive of all groups of people, so that everyone has access to clean air, food and water. As a dear friend always says, \"Climate Justice isn't just for the rich and the white.\" It is a fight alongside those who are displaced; whose rivers have been poisoned; whose lands were stolen; who watch their houses get washed away every other season; and those who fight tirelessly for what are basic human rights. We fight alongside those actively silenced by the masses and portrayed as 'voiceless', because it is easier for savarnas to call them voiceless. We take the easy way out and fund saviourism rather than amplify the voices on ground.\n\nThe immense outpour of love from the people gave me strength. I am grateful for everyone who stood by me. The past few days have been beyond painful, yet I know that I am one of the privileged. I was lucky enough to have excellent pro bono legal assistance but what of all those who do not? What of all those still in jail whose stories are not marketable? What of the marginalized that are not worthy of your screen time? What of those who face the world's brazen indifference? Although their physical forms are trapped behind bars because of our collective silence, their ideas continue to live on as will the united resistance of the people. Ideas do not die. And, truth, no matter how long it takes, always reveals itself.\n\n\"We are threatened every day, our voices crushed; but we will continue to fight.\" - Soni Sori\n\nStill fighting for climate justice,\n\nDisha A Ravi"}

The government must discuss this in the house. When there are serious allegations against his minister, Nitish Kumar has been absent. The government is scared and nervous. They are not allowing the Opposition to speak. They fear that we will show the evidence. There is no such weak chief minister in the country as Nitish Kumar,\" Mr Yadav told mediapersons in Patna.\n\nHitting out at Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Tarkishore Prasad, Mr Yadav said, \"The deputy chief minister is not a constitutional post. When the speaker is allowing me to speak then why is he interrupting. Who does give him the right to dictate the speaker? This government has made those people ministers who do not aware of the constitution.\"\n\nThe RJD leader alleged that the state government has destroyed Bihar in every aspect.\n\n\"There is high inflation. Unemployment is at its peak. From farmers to students, all are unhappy. Women are not safe. The government is not allowing us to put our views in the House. It is a dictatorship. Vidhan Sabha has become the office of Janata Dal (United) and Bharatiya Janata Party,\" said Mr Yadav.\n\nEarlier in the day, Tejashwi, Tej Pratap Yadav and other RJD MLAs held a protest march towards the Raj Bhawan after walking out of the Bihar assembly. They met the Governor and raised the issue before him.\n\nNotably, there was a ruckus in the Bihar assembly regarding the allegations of smuggling of illicit liquor against state minister Ramsurat Rai. The controversy surfaced after illicit liquor was recovered earlier this week from a school in Muzaffarpur run by Mr Rai's brother.\n\nIn 2016, Nitish Kumar banned alcohol consumption in Bihar making it a dry state."}

That day, it was the occasion of Holi and the complainant and their children were hungry after celebrating the festival.\n\nShe further said that the pizza was delivered late as opposed to 30 minutes delivery time frame given by the company. However, she chose to ignore the same and took a bite of the pizza.

After lengthy rounds of talks, the two sides simultaneously withdrew troops from the Pangong Lake area last month while talks are on for the withdrawal of soldiers from the rest of the friction points along the LAC.\n\nIn a joint statement, the Quad leaders pledged to strengthen cooperation on the \"defining challenges of our time.\"\n\n\"We bring diverse perspectives and are united in a shared vision for the free and open Indo-Pacific.? We strive for a region that is free, open, inclusive, healthy, anchored by democratic values, and unconstrained by coercion,\" said the joint statement titled 'The Spirit of the Quad''.\n\nJake Sullivan said the four leaders also spoke to the competition of models between autocracy and democracy and expressed their confidence that despite setbacks and imperfections, democracy is the best system to deliver for people and to meet the economic, social, and technological challenges of the 21st century, he said.\n\nJake Sullivan said much of the focus during Friday's Quad summit was on pressing global crises, including climate change and COVID-19. With respect to COVID-19, the four leaders made a massive joint commitment, he told reporters.\n\n\"With Indian manufacturing, US technology, Japanese and American financing and Australian logistics capability, the Quad committed to delivering up to 1 billion doses to ASEAN, the Indo-Pacific and beyond by the end of 2022,\" said the top American national security advisor.\n\nThe leaders also launched a set of working groups, including an emerging technology group that will help set standards in key technologies like 5G and artificial intelligence, and another on cyberspace that will help the four countries meet this growing threat.\n\n\"These groups will deliver results by the time of the summit that will happen before the end of the year,\" Jake Sullivan said.\n\n\"The Quad is now a critical part of the architecture of the Indo-Pacific, and today's summit also kicks off an intensive stretch of diplomacy in the region,\" he said.\n\nSecretary of State Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin will travel to Japan and South Korea to meet with their counterparts in a 2-plus-2 format, he noted.\n\n\"Make no mistake; today is a big day for American diplomacy. This summit is a big deal for the president and for the country, and we are looking forward to the work ahead,\" Jake Sullivan said.\n\nResponding to a question, Jake Sullivan said that the four leaders discussed both the recent cyber-attacks and semiconductors in the course of the conversation.\n\nThe leaders agreed as part of the emerging technology working group to look at this supply chain question, including as it relates to semiconductors, to make sure that they don't have shortages of critical materials going forward, whether it's semiconductors or rare-earth.\n\nHe said the impetus behind the new cyber working group is not just the SolarWinds incident or the Microsoft Exchange incident, both of which the United States is responding to with urgency, but also cyber-attacks that have hit Japan, India, and Australia just in the past few weeks and months.\n\n\"This is a common challenge that we face from both state actors and non-state actors, and we do intend to make the Quad a central vehicle for cooperation on cyber,\" Jake Sullivan added."}

Our findings don''t necessarily mean that vaccines won't prevent COVID, only that the antibody portion of the immune response may have trouble recognizing some of these new variants,\" Balazs said.\n\nThe researchers added that understanding which mutations are most likely to allow the virus to evade vaccine-derived immunity is essential to develop next-generation vaccines that can provide protection against new variants.\n\nThey said this can also help researchers develop more effective preventative methods, such as broadly protective vaccines that work against a wide variety of variants, regardless of which mutations develop."}

It has also linked the recent injury sustained by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to the larger \"conspiracy\". Voting for the 294-seat House is scheduled in eight phases between March 27 and April 29.\n\nThe Trinamool Congress and the BJP have been involved in a visceral rivalry over the past many months. The ruling party has haemorrhaged considerably with a stream of leaders and cadres switching loyalties to the BJP, which hopes to topple Ms Banerjee's government. The Trinamool, on its part, has said those moving out were people aware that they wouldn't get tickets or were those who were denied tickets. Such people, the ruling party has said, won't affect its prospects.\n\nIn recent days, various Central agencies have tightened the screw in several cases of alleged scams, putting many ruling party leaders in the spotlight.\n\nFor instance, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has summoned state Education Minister Partha Chatterjee on March 15 in connection with a ponzi scam pertaining to the ICore group of companies. Similarly, former minister Madan Mitra, the party's candidate from Kamarhati, has been summoned by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the Saradha chit fund scam probe. He has been asked to visit the agency's Kolkata office before March 18.\n\nOn Friday, the CBI issued summons to two relatives of Menaka Gambhir, the sister-in-law of Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee. This is in connection with the multi-crore coal pilferage scam, sources said. Mr Banerjee is the Chief Minister's nephew.\n\nThe Trinamool says this spurt in activity on the agencies' part, coming right ahead of the election, was suspicious. It viewed this as an attempt to derail the party's campaign.\n\nA few days ago, the Chief Minister herself was injured in the leg while campaigning in Nandigram, her chosen constituency.

The legislation also directs the Attorney General to issue guidance to state and local law enforcement agencies on appropriate public education campaigns and the collection of data on COVID-19 hate crimes.\n\nThe ongoing anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents, especially against our elderly Asian Americans, is absolutely horrific, said Congresswoman Meng. \"Since the beginning of the pandemic there have been nearly 3,000 reported incidents of physical, verbal, and online attacks against Asian Americans,\" she said.\n\nActing US Attorney Tessa M Gorman and FBI Special Agent in Charge Donald M. Voiret said that currently federal prosecutors and the FBI are reviewing two cases involving assaults on Asian-American neighbours that have been charged by the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office.\n\n\"These crimes, and other acts of hate and bias, have no place in our community. I urge members of our community to report hate-based crimes to either local or federal law enforcement and to contact our office''s civil rights line with information about discrimination in areas like housing, employment, education, or public accommodations,\" Gorman said."}

His wife alleged that the vehicle was lent out to the cop for four months till February 5, a few days after which it was reported stolen. While the NIA is on the case of the threat to Mr Ambani, the state Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) is looking into the trader's death and the car's theft.\n\nFormer Maharashtra Chief Minister and leader of the opposition, Devendra Fadnavis, had on Tuesday demanded Mr Vaze's arrest for his suspected link to Mr Hiran's death.\n\nMr Vaze filed his anticipatory bail plea on Friday at the Thane district sessions court. He termed the case filed against him \"baseless and without any motive\" and a \"witch-hunt\". He further claimed that at the time when Mr Hiran went missing and was allegedly killed, he was at Dongri in South Mumbai.\n\n\"It is trite law that a bald suspicion of the first informant regarding the commission of a crime cannot justify arrest of a citizen,\" his plea said, according to a PTI report.\n\nThe court, however, refused him any interim relief on Saturday, observing that Mr Hiran was found to have spent time with the Mr Vaze on February 27 and February 28. The body was discovered on March 4.\n\n\"The custodial interrogation of applicant is necessary,\" the court said, adding that the ATS investigating officer's say in the matter is required, for which the hearing will now take place on March 19.\n\nThe NIA summoned him on Saturday to its office to question him in connection to the case involving the threat to the Ambani family. Later in the day, the ATS, too, reached NIA office.\n\nOn February 25, the Scorpio was found near Mr Ambani's south Mumbai residence with explosives and a threat letter inside. The police traced the vehicle back to Mr Hiran, but he claimed it had been stolen a week earlier. The case got murkier when he himself was found dead in a creek in Thane on March 5. His wife then accused Mr Vaze of being involved in his death.\n\nOn Wednesday, the officer, who had earlier joined the Shiv Sena during a period of suspension from service, was moved out of the Mumbai crime branch to the Citizen Facilitation Centre (CFC) at the police headquarters.\n\nThe ATS has recorded Mr Vaze's statement earlier this week, in which he has denied using the SUV."}

Latest Hotel Amenity In US Is A Free Coronavirus Test", "link": "https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/coronavirus-free-coronavirus-test-among-popular-hotel-perks-in-us-amid-pandemic-2389770", "content": "Several hospitality players have introduced free insurance policies.\n\nAs a senior manager of member services at Exclusive Resorts, Lambie Swenson assists vacation club members with choosing a destination and accommodations based on their interests and travel style. Since the coronavirus outbreak, her field of expertise has expanded, earning her a new title: covid navigator.\n\n\"It's an extra hat I wear,\" Swenson said from her Oregon home, \"but wouldn't it be fantastic if I didn't have to wear this hat later in the year?\"\n\nSince the onset of the global health crisis, Swenson has been spending about 20 hours a week handling members' queries and concerns about the pandemic and their travel plans. She addresses many issues in \"Know Before You Go,\" a dossier shared on the members-only site. The overview for Peninsula Papagayo in Costa Rica, for instance, includes guidance on coronavirus test sites, mandatory health insurance and capacity limits at national parks. She pulls the information from official government sources and laces it with anecdotes from staff on the ground plus feedback from members who have firsthand knowledge of the destination.\n\n\"Members want to know what's open and what's closed, are people wearing masks, and how many days will they need to quarantine,\" she said. \"People want to feel safe, but they also want everything to be open and feel like they're on vacation.\"\n\nThe idea of a covid specialist is still a novelty in the hospitality industry, but over the year, hotels have been introducing new amenities that speak to these anxiety-riddled times. In the early months of the pandemic, hotels were loading up guests with complimentary masks and hand sanitizer. A second wave of perks is now upon us, triggered by a January announcement that all air travelers entering the United States must provide proof of a negative \"viral test.\" (Acceptable tests include antigen tests and nucleic acid amplification tests, or NAAT, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)\n\n\"You have to make people feel absolutely comfortable when they stay with you,\" said Robert Cole, a senior research analyst at Phocuswright who specializes in lodging and leisure travel. \"The hotels need to communicate that they have a way to protect you. That they have your back.\"\n\nThe most popular perk of 2021 is the coronavirus test. A news release from January declared, \"On-site CORONAVIRUS TESTS Are Hotels' New Luxury Amenity.\" A public relations firm was pitching the feature at hotels in Miami Beach and Los Angeles, even though a negative test result is not required for domestic travel. However, some guests might find a test reassuring after sitting on a crowded plane or packed beach for several hours.\n\nThe particulars - cost, type of test, location - vary. Some properties have arranged free antigen tests administered on the hotel's premises; others offer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests conducted for a fee at a local clinic or hospital, with logistical assistance from the front desk. A few provide both. Meli\u00e1 Hotels International, for instance, set up complimentary antigen testing at 10 of its hotels in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. A current promotion featuring a barefaced couple frolicking on the beach includes a free fourth night and an antigen test. Meli\u00e1's staff can also help guests schedule a PCR test for an additional cost. Sandals and Beaches resorts in the Caribbean have two tests available to guests, both free: the antigen for American visitors and PCR for Canadians. Montage International, which runs Montage and Pendry hotels and resorts, has pushed the health care amenity even further by partnering with One Medical. Guests at its U.S. properties can sign up for a free 30-day membership. Now, you can get a coronavirus test and ask about that rash on your arm.\n\nAt Baha Mar in the Bahamas, Americans must undergo a trifecta of tests during their stay: one at arrival, a second on the fifth day (as mandated by the government) and a third before flying home (per U.S. law). Since December, when the Grand Hyatt Baha Mar reopened, the company has administered more than 42,000 free tests. The number will probably skyrocket: On March 4, SLS Baha Mar and Rosewood Baha Mar welcomed back visitors.\n\nTo safeguard tourists and residents, Jamaica established Resilient Corridors, zones that contain about 80% of the island's tourism businesses. More than 40 hotels residing in these areas - from Negril to Port Antonio in the north and the Milk River in Clarendon to Negril in the south - have on-site testing. The government also installed 15 testing operations in the corridors, for guests whose hotels do not offer the service.\n\n\"We had to step up our testing infrastructure,\" said Edmund Bartlett, the country's minister of tourism. \"We have not had any situation yet where Americans were stranded because they couldn't get a test.\"\n\nScheduling a test can be as easy as booking a spa treatment or in-room massage. At the W South Beach Hotel in Miami, guests reserve an appointment through the concierge desk or by scanning a QR code in their room. The test site, which is run by Sollis Health, resides in a former beauty salon adjoining the hotel. At Dorado Beach, a Ritz Carlton Reserve, in Puerto Rico, a doctor will make a house call - or, rather, a guest-room call - for $400. Blue Desert Cabo in Mexico has a similar arrangement: A test-kit-carrying medical professional will drop by your villa for a nominal fee. \"It's that simple,\" said Sean McClenahan, president of Blue Desert Cabo. In addition, the property's staff will schedule the appointment so that it falls within the 72-hour window required by the U.S. government.\n\nRest assured, the bellman is not sticking a cotton tip up your nose. The hotels are collaborating with medical facilities, such as hospitals and labs. But Robert Bollinger, a professor of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University's School of Medicine, said guests should make sure the health care workers are following safety standards and practices. (Bollinger does not advocate nonessential travel.) The test, for one, should come from an approved kit, and the professionals should be wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). He warned that if the steps are not conducted correctly, the patient could receive an incorrect result and inadvertently expose other travelers to the virus.\n\n\"The biggest challenge is when the person performing the test does not collect the specimen properly and you get a false negative,\" he said. Bollinger suggests taking a second test if you are concerned. He added that a negative result does not mean you have a pass to roam. \"If you have symptoms or have had a recent covid-19 exposure,\" he said, \"don't get on the plane, even if you test negative.\"\n\nSeveral hospitality players have introduced free insurance policies - or promises - that handle the worst-case scenario: a guest testing positive. Travel Safe with Melia and Sandals' Travel Protection Insurance, for example, cover the patient's medical costs and up to two weeks of lodging. Karisma Hotels & Resorts properties in Mexico's Riviera Maya, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica will also accommodate a quarantining guest free for up to two weeks. Baha Mar's Travel with Confidence initiative includes a $150 daily food and beverage credit with its courtesy convalescence suite. If the traveler would rather return to the States than recover in the Bahamas, the company will fly the guest and up to four family members sharing the same room to South Florida at no cost. A sign of the times: The aircraft is not a swanky charter plane but an air ambulance.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}

It is the TMC which is trying to drive a wedge between them with its appeasement politics,\" Mr Adhikari added.\n\nA senior Trinamool leader in the district conceded that only the Muslim votes can't ensure the party's victory in the seat.\n\n\"If Suvendu manages to consolidate Hindu votes given the communally charged atmosphere in Nandigram, things might get difficult (for TMC),\" he said.\n\nAccording to Trinamool sources, the soft Hindutva push by the party may be a new thing in Nandigram, but it has been the party's strategy following the electoral reverses in the 2019\n\nLok Sabha elections.\n\nThe party's decision to organise ''Brahmin Sammelan'', give allowances to Sanatan Brahmins and extend financial assistance to Durga Puja committees were all part of that carefully planned strategy, they said.\n\nElections in Bengal will be held in eight phases, beginning with polling for 30 seats on March 27. Votes will be counted on May 2.\n\nThe Trinamool leadership countered Mr Adhikari's claim, saying Ms Banerjee's temple visits were nothing new. Her government, the party said, has been helping Durga Puja committees in the state with generous financial assistance for years, with the chief minister personally inaugurating many pandals.\n\n\"Both the TMC and BJP are trying to communally polarise the voters of the state. We will resist it and fight for the rights of the masses,\" CPI(M)'s Purba Medinipur district secretary Niranjan Sihi said.\n\nBoth Trinamool and BJP leaders admit that Nandigram stands communally polarised.\n\nThe shoots first appeared after the 2013 panchayat polls when elected Muslim members were given prominent roles in Zilla Parishads and the ruling party's district unit, they said.\n\nA massive Ram Navami procession in the area in 2016, in which many Trinamool workers participated, widened the crack.\n\nThe BJP, which hardly had any presence in the area, made massive inroads by bagging over 1.96 lakh votes in the 2016 by-elections to the Tamluk Lok Sabha seat under which the Nandigram assembly segment falls.\n\nIn the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the BJP further consolidated its position, cinching over 5.34 lakh votes.\n\nLocal BJP leader Sabuj Pradhan claimed, \"Nandigram is sitting on a tinderbox, and only the TMC's appeasement politics is responsible for it. If you deny the majority community its rights, you will have to face the consequences.\"\n\nSheikh Sufiyan, deputy chairman of the Zilla Parishad and Ms Banerjee's election agent, described the charge of Hindus being denied government benefits as a \"disinformation and divisive\" campaign by the BJP.\n\nNandigram Block 1 Trinamool president Swadesh Das said the BJP will be taught a lesson in secularism in Nandigram.\n\n\"If the BJP thinks it will get the entire Hindu votes, they are living in a fool's paradise,\" he said.\n\nPolitical analyst Biswanath Chakraborty feels the BJP has, in a way, already become successful by making the Trinamool toe its line.\n\n\"The BJP may win or lose Nandigram but it has been successful in forcing the ruling TMC to follow its Hindutva line for votes,\" he said."}

It is relatively cheap, and easier to store than other jabs.\n\nBut it has been dogged by controversy in Europe, with some governments initially refusing to certify its use for people aged over 65 despite scientific advice finding no reason for limits.\n\nThis week Denmark, Norway and Iceland have paused its use as a precaution after isolated reports of recipients developing blood clots.\n\nItaly and Austria have also banned the use of shots from separate batches, while Bulgaria and Thailand said they would delay its rollout.\n\nHowever, the World Health Organization earlier Friday said there was no reason to stop using the Covid-19 vaccine, stressing there was no causal link between the jab and any clotting.\n\nA range of health authorities have also insisted it is safe, including the European Medicines Agency.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman told reporters on Thursday: \"We've been clear that it's both safe and effective... and when people are asked to come forward and take it, they should do so in confidence.\"\n\nBritain began the world's first mass vaccination drive against the coronavirus in December, underpinned largely by the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and another from Pfizer-BioNTech.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)"}
