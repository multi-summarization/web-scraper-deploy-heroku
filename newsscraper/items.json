But those pulling Russia back historically are doomed. There are more of us in any case.\u201d\n\nNavalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin \u2014 accusations that Russian officials reject.\n\nSoon after, a court found that the politician\u2019s stay in Germany violated the terms of his suspended sentence for a 2014 embezzlement conviction and ordered him to serve 2 1/2 years in prison.\n\nThe mass street protests in support of Navalny \u2014 which authorities had declared unlawful \u2014 swept dozens of cities and smaller towns across Russia. The largest crowds were seen in Moscow, where thousands marched down the city center amid a heavy police presence.\n\nYet unlike on past occasions, officers in riot gear didn't interfere with the rally in the Russian capital, allowing crowds to swarm streets and squares for hours. According to OVD-Info, a rights group that monitors political arrests, police detained only 31 people in Moscow, which usually accounts for the vast majority of arrests across the country.\n\nBut overall, OVD-Info tallied more than 1,900 arrests Wednesday night, with more than 800 in St. Petersburg. While some violent detentions, with police using stun guns, were reported in St. Petersburg, in many cities the demonstrations went on without clashes with law enforcement.\n\nLeonid Volkov, Navalny's top strategist and chief of staff, noted in the YouTube live stream that the number of arrests was significantly lower than during the nationwide protests in January after Navalny was arrested.\n\nIndependent political analyst Abbas Gallyamov believes the turnout at Wednesday's protests indicates that the harsh Russian crackdown on previous demonstrations hasn't scared off Navalny's supporters.\n\nHundreds were jailed after the January demonstrations and Navalny allies were slapped with criminal charges for allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions.\n\nNavalny\u2019s aides and associates in different Russian regions, in the meantime, were targeted with detentions and raids both before and after Wednesday's protests. Many were jailed, and one was reportedly brutally beaten by police who came to search his apartment.\n\nGallyamov said this indicated a change of tactics for the authorities, from sweeping crackdowns on all demonstrators to targeting suspected protest leaders.\n\nLast week, Russian authorities took the pressure on Navalny\u2019s allies and supporters to a new level, with the Moscow prosecutor\u2019s office petitioning a court to label as his Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his network of regional offices as extremist groups. Human rights activists say such a move would paralyze their activities and expose their members and donors to prison sentences of up to 10 years.\n\nNavalny began the hunger strike to protest prison authorities\u2019 refusal to let his doctors visit after he developed severe back pain and numbness in his legs. Officials insisted Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs. But Navalny's doctors said last week that the politician could be near death, as his test results showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicated impaired kidneys.\n\nNavalny was transferred Sunday from a penal colony east of Moscow to the hospital ward of another prison in Vladimir, a city 180 kilometers (110 miles) east of the capital.\n\nOn Thursday, Navalny's personal physician Dr. Anastasia Vasilyeva released a letter she signed with four other doctors, urging him to end his hunger strike.\n\nThe letter revealed that Navalny was taken to a regular hospital Tuesday in Vladimir, where he underwent tests and was examined by specialists \u201cin accordance\u201d with requests from his doctors.

I appeal to the Centre to allot more injections to Maharashtra as the situation here is grave. I will be writing to the Union Health Ministry in this regard,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Centre on Wednesday had detailed an allocation of 2.69 lakh vials for Maharashtra till the end of this month. This translates into less than 30,000 vials per day.\n\nLikewise, Mr. Tope appealed to the Centre to increase Maharashtra\u2019s oxygen allocation quota as well.\n\n\u201cThe oxygen distribution quota is in the Centre\u2019s hands. I humbly request the Centre to ensure safe transport by transporting the oxygen through a \u2018green corridor\u2019 to Maharashtra,\u201d said the Health Minister.\n\nRemarking that the pandemic situation in the State had spiralled out of control, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut urged the Centre to stop according \u2018step-motherly treatment\u2019 to Maharashtra in terms of supply of oxygen, vaccines and medicines.\n\n\u201cWe need 80,000 vials of Remdesivir per day. Yet, why is the State getting less from the Centre? Who are the people who are playing with the lives of the people of Maharashtra?\u201d said Mr. Raut.\n\nMeanwhile, the BJP\u2019s Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, Pravin Darekar, hit back at both the \u2018Maha Vikas Aghadi\u2019 government leaders (Mr. Tope and Mr. Raut), while remarking that it was high time the State government stopped pointing fingers at the Centre instead of doing something on its own to curb the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cIt appears that if anything happens, the Uddhav Thackeray government first begins to blame the Centre. The Central government has already raised Maharashtra\u2019s oxygen supply quota to more than 1,600 MT. Now, whose responsibility is it to get that oxygen for the State? The leaders of the MVA government cannot even arrange for tankers or special flights to procure that oxygen,\u201d said Mr. Darekar, accusing the State government of attempting to cutting corners instead of utilising the taxpayer\u2019s money to save lives."}

Spread over 30.6 hectares, the Thazhambur lake is a freshwater source for the locality that heavily depends on groundwater for its needs.\n\nThe waterbody can now store up to 22 million cubic feet of water after the restoration efforts of Care Earth Trust, a city-based biodiversity research organisation, with funding from Hinduja Leyland Finance.\n\nKannan Sethuraman, a resident of Thazhambur, noted that the size of the garbage dump had been increasing for the past four years and hospital waste, too, was often dumped there. Thick smoke emanating from the fire engulfed the area and often caused irritation in the eyes and throat.\n\nThe Arihant Heirloom Flat Owners Association and the Adroit District apartment association had represented the issue to the local body and the Kancheepuram district administration. Residents complained that the waste was dumped by private vehicles and those belonging to the panchayat. This affected nearly 800 apartments and houses around the lake.\n\nAnbu Vahini, a resident, said the lake was recently rejuvenated and was also now home to several species of birds. It was also major source of groundwater recharge. Frequent burning of garbage close to the lake may contaminate the freshwater body.\n\nShe recalled that the local body had promised to take up scientific disposal of waste through composting during the hearing of a case filed by Madipakkam residents at the National Green Tribunal, Southern Zone, in 2017. However, the panchayat was yet to adopt a solid waste management policy.\n\nResidents demanded that the local body shift the dumping yard to an alternate site.\n\nJayshree Vencatesan, managing trustee, Care Earth Trust, said the lake had been restored and fenced. Residents had planted saplings along the waterbody. Waste was being dumped on the outer periphery of the lake. Security personnel had been deployed to prevent the misuse of the waterbody, including the dumping of waste.\n\nSources in the Thazhambur village panchayat said the vacant plot was being used after approval. \u201cWe are unable to find an alternate site in the locality as it has become urbanised. We are planning to seek permission from Greater Chennai Corporation to convey waste from Thazhambur to its dumping site.\u201d"}

(name changed), a resident of Banaswadi, recalled the helplessness of trying to find an ICU bed for her husband whose oxygen saturation levels were dropping at alarming levels due to COVID-19.\n\nAs they rode in the ambulance knocking on the doors of hospitals, her husband\u2019s oxygen saturation levels dropped to 54. \u201cI did call the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) helpline and there were no ICU beds available in the government quota. So, I took him in an ambulance and went searching for a bed. The ordeal lasted three hours,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the clamour for hospital beds only increasing by the day, the BBMP is pushing for a common platform and booking system to be put in place that will allow people to monitor and book beds in the private quota as well.\n\nThis will bring more transparency to a system that citizens allege is opaque. Such a system already exists for beds available under government quota. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, BBMP\u2019s Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said, \u201cA common booking system may help COVID-19 patients and prevent them from going to multiple hospitals in search of beds. This has been discussed in high-level meetings with the State government.\u201d\n\nHowever, BBMP sources said there was some resistance from private hospitals in putting such a system in place.\n\nHowever, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes\u2019 Association (PHANA) president Prasanna H.M. said the bed management system for private quota was in the process of being readied. \u201cWe wanted to have this in place last year itself. But dropped the idea after the number of cases came down. We will now have a dry run of the system on Friday and launch it soon,\u201d he said.\n\nAn integration of the existing system and a platform for private quota beds is the need of the hour, said officials. It is a system that may ease the trauma of finding a bed for their loved ones.\n\nSoftware engineer Shubha Rao called over 30 private hospitals after her colleague\u2019s father-in-law tested positive with low oxygen saturation and was in need of an ICU bed.\n\n\u201cWe finally got a bed in a small hospital that I didn\u2019t even know existed. Most people turn to big hospitals. There is a need for a centralised database of beds available under the government and private quota that is updated in real time,\u201d she said.\n\nThe BBMP is coordinating with various private hospitals towards making a total of 11,000 beds available over the next two to three days. The State government too has directed all private hospitals and medical colleges to hand over 80% of beds in their facilities to the government.\n\nMr. Gupta acknowledged the limited number of ICU beds in the city. The 600 ICU beds that had been handed over had already been allotted under the BBMP\u2019s hospital bed management system.\n\n\u201cAs and when there is an availability, ICU beds are being allotted. Towards increasing the number of ICU beds, we have held discussions with private medical colleges and private hospitals. The total may increase by another 200,\u201d he stated.\n\nAt the government level, initiative is being taken to establish ICU temporary hospitals. \u201cIf this is done, an additional 1,000 ICU beds may be available,\u201d he added.\n\nHe urged citizens not to panic, and stated that nearly 90% of those who test positive do not require any serious medical interventions.\n\nCare centres\n\nThe BBMP will have in place 12 COVID-19 Care Centres (CCCs) for those who don\u2019t have the wherewithal to isolate themselves at home, said Mr. Gupta.\n\nApart from these facilities, step down hospital and private CCCs with certain medical facilities are being established by private hospitals in association with hotels."}

The last time it was above 10% was during the last week of July, when an average of 60,000 tests were being done and 6,500 cases reported daily.\n\nThe State had 120 labs then. Now, it has more than doubled the figure to 263, with a capacity to perform RT-PCR and other types of tests for COVID-19. This raises questions about whether Tamil Nadu can and should increase testing.\n\nChennai, in particular, has a daily TPR of over 20% now. Last July, when the city was reporting a high number of cases, it was testing around 11,000-12,000 people a day, while its TPR was at 10%. While the cases reported daily have more than doubled now, tests increased to an average 17,000 last week \u2014 only a 50% increase from last July.\n\nA comparison of Tamil Nadu with other States also highlighted the possible need for increased testing. For instance, among the 15 States that have over 50,000 active cases, Tamil Nadu stands ninth in terms of tests per million population performed every day.\n\nOfficials in Tamil Nadu have often highlighted the State\u2019s complete reliance on RT-PCR tests, calling it the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, unlike other States that have widely used rapid antigen detection tests too.\n\nDelhi and Karnataka, among the few States to provide a break-up on the number of RT-PCR and other tests performed on a daily basis, however, indicate the possibility of better utilisation of lab capacities.\n\nDelhi, with 81 RT-PCR testing labs, performed 60,022 tests on average every day. Karnataka, with 153 labs, performed 1.25 lakh tests. In comparison, Tamil Nadu, with 189 RT-PCR labs, performed just 1.05 lakh tests.\n\nPrabhdeep Kaur, Deputy Director, National Institute of Epidemiology-ICMR, stressed the need for increasing testing based on a focused and data-driven approach to proactively identify hotspots and contain the spread. She said that while Chennai had been doing it to a considerable extent, mainly through its fever camps, a similar approach could be followed across the State. \u201cThis can be particularly helpful in rural areas where people may have difficulties in getting themselves tested sooner,\u201d she said.\n\nK. Kolandaisamy, former Director of Public Health, Tamil Nadu, said tests had fairly stabilised in the State, and a sharp increase should not be undertaken to artificially bring TPR down. He, however, stressed the need for an increase in focused and proactive testing in containment zones, testing of antenatal mothers and others visiting hospitals.\n\nJ. Radhakrishnan, Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, said the government was following a principle of testing at least 10 persons for every person testing positive. \u201cThe tests needed for effective tracing are being done. We are also steadily increasing testing on a daily basis,\u201d he said."}

He said the government was providing the drug to private hospitals, which did not have enough stock, at \u20b9783 per vial, though the maximum retail price of each vial was \u20b94,800. Mr. Narayan said the State had a capacity to store 1,167 tonnes of oxygen and manufacture 400 tonnes a day. Additionally, 150 tonnes a day could be produced in Puducherry. However, the current usage in Tamil Nadu was only 250 tonnes a day; therefore, 65 tonnes of surplus oxygen was recently diverted to the neighbouring States, he said.\n\nThe court was told that 9,600 ventilators were available in government hospitals, and 5,887 of them had been earmarked for COVID-19 patients. The government also had many Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines and 2,440 high-flow nasal oxygen cannulas. Private hospitals had 6,000 ventilators, of which 3,000 had been earmarked for COVID-19 patients\n\nWhen the Chief Justice wanted to know the number of active cases, the Advocate-General said 84,361 was the latest figure available with him and sought time to submit the number of beds and vaccine doses available. After recording his submissions and observing that special regulations must be put in place for the counting of votes on May 2, the judges directed the High Court Registry to list the case again for Monday for submission of the data."}

Scared of their uncertain future, they find themselves a mere spent force and turn to listening to bhajans and puranas for solace.\n\nReports of those died of the virus getting \u2018orphan-like\u2019 funeral by the staff of the civic bodies, shortage of hospital beds, oxygen and blackmarketing of life-saving drugs and hefty hospital bills have left them shaken.\n\nMany of the elderly people are now seen at local temples, offering prayers, and spending time by doing bhajans and listening to puranas.

While the district is likely to get 30,000 doses initially, official sources said up to 65,000 doses could be expected.\n\nFollowing a lull caused by an acute shortage of vaccine doses, the vaccination programme is set to be on track with the health authorities scheduling the drive across 108 centres in the district on Friday. Barring three hospitals that will provide Covaxin, all the others will administer Covishield. These include 47 public institutions and 58 private hospitals.\n\n600 doses a day\n\nNotably, the Jimmy George indoor stadium, which has functioned as a mega vaccination centre, will rejoin the drive three days after the programme was suspended there owing to the paucity of vaccine. However, spot registration will no longer be entertained there with the government insisting on online bookings. Moreover, the vaccination drive at the stadium could be restricted to around 600 doses a day to prevent crowding.\n\nThe venue has earlier seen around 1,800 people getting inoculated in a day.\n\nOn Thursday, General Hospital (GH) witnessed some disorder when a large number of people queued up hoping to get registered on the spot for the vaccine. Despite having waited outside the hospital\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination centre from 5.30 a.m., they were informed of the decision to restrict vaccines to online registrees only by 8.30 a.m This led to tension with many senior citizens venting their ire on healthcare workers. Soon, the police streamlined the crowd by sending off those who had not booked online.\n\nA total of 2,931 vaccine doses were administered in the district on the day. Among those who received the vaccine, 1,704 were vaccinated with Covishield and 1,227 with Covaxin. Those who got the second doses include 712 front-line workers and 634 others who are aged above 45 years."}

The hospital apparently told him that they have been trying to manage cylinders for the last three days but were unable to arrange.\n\nWith other senior officers in tow, he rushed to the hospital and spoke to the management, who were panicking because lives of more than 350 patients were in their hands.\n\nThe first task was to identify where they could procure the oxygen from, as the hospital required liquid oxygen tankers. Teams then identified that one oxygen tanker was travelling to GTB Hospital. \u201cBut at that crucial point, the driver wasn\u2019t picking the call. We had to trace him and almost intercept him,\u201d he recalled. The team then went to GTB Hospital with the tanker before bringing it to the Batra Hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, police got another lead that an oxygen tanker was coming from Haryana\u2019s Samalkha. But the old hassle surfaced. The driver\u2019s traced location didn\u2019t match with what he was saying. He was finally found in West Delhi and brought to Batra Hospital.\n\n\u201cAmid all this, we were informed that the oxygen had completely run out and some patients were having seizures. The pressure was mounting. Around 12.30 a.m., Samalkha tanker reached and by 1 a.m., the one from GTB too came. We helped them with seven tonnes of oxygen,\u201d he said, adding that over 100 policemen were involved in this mission for five to six hours.\n\nOne hurdle after other\n\nReflecting on the situation, a senior officer termed coordinating as the toughest challenge, besides pointing out that supplies are disrupted as more oxygen is required but there is no arrangement to meet the demands.\n\n\u201cPlanning for the second wave was not conducted in terms of oxygen and hospital requirement. There is a huge lack of a tracking system, which would make oxygen supply smooth and check consignment,\u201d he said.\n\nProduction of oxygen has not been enhanced as it should have been and internal disputes of several stakeholders appears to have lead to this chaos, sources said of their opinion after observing ground situation. Sources said that many officers are infected in the force and for some, their families are infected due to which they need leaves which seniors can\u2019t deny.\n\n\u201cMuch of our resources are diverted to the healthcare situation while we have to ensure the lockdown is imposed and guidelines are followed,\u201d an officer said.\n\nAdditional DCP (Outer) Sudhanshu Dhama has been attending distress calls for the last few days. The latest was from Rathi Hospital, who were in a dire situation on Wednesday evening with lives of 78 patients at stake. Mr. Dhama, who was in the hospital till around 3a.m. on Thursday, along with his teams, managed to arrange 120 oxygen cylinders from Bawana, Kanjhawala, Mayapuri and even from another hospital.\n\n\u201cWe had to plead with other hospitals,\u201d he said, adding that hospitals are scared to help because of the fear of cylinders running out.\n\nThe police are stretched, but they keep on helping the city breathe. \u201cAt this point, one cannot say this is not my job because the situation is such. One cannot demarcate. Right now, we are providing help by whatever means we can,\u201d he said.\n\nDCP (North) Anto Alphonse, who had arranged oxygen for NKS Hospital from Mayapuri by going in person, said his control room has been attending to PCR calls from people calling for hospital beds, life-saving injections, oxygen cylinders and even ration. He said they are trying their best to meet their needs while adding that coordinating for oxygen with suppliers is a task at the moment, he said.\n\nCoordination pangs\n\nPranav Tayal, DCP (Rohini), also said that coordinating with gas agencies for oxygen and then providing it in that short span of time to the hospitals is challenging. \u201cWe arranged 50 oxygen cylinders for a private hospital and they were delivered in two hours. They were arranged from Bawana and Khanjhawala,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the data shared by Delhi Police, only 5-10 officials were testing positive till April 4. But the numbers soared to 263 on April 20. There was marginal respite, as it came down to 193 on Wednesday."}

{"source": "hindu", "headline": "Amplifying the written word", "link": "https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/amplifying-the-written-word/article34387129.ece", "cat": "Comment", "content": "The Internet has allowed easier communication between journalists and readers\n\nSome months ago, I received an email from a reader about an article I had written on current research on Friedreich\u2019s ataxia, a disease that causes damage to the nervous system as well as speech impairment and movement problems. Friedrich\u2019s ataxia starts during childhood and manifests later as impaired muscular coordination that worsens with age. It is caused by an inherited aberrant gene.\n\nWe all carry two copies of every gene, each inherited from a parent. Friedrich\u2019s ataxia occurs when both copies of the FXN gene have the defect. The defective FXN gene causes a problem in producing a protein called frataxin, which is found in cells throughout the body, with the highest levels in the heart, spinal cord, liver, pancreas, and muscles used for voluntary movement.\n\nThe article described how the researchers had identified a way to tag the defective part of the gene and bind it so that frataxin can be produced normally. This was done in cell lines in the lab, and treatment of people with the problem was still some distance away.\n\nI got a few emails after this article was published asking me for the contact details of the researchers. These emails mentioned that relatives were suffering from Friedrich\u2019s ataxia and that perhaps the research would hold the key. This was not surprising or new \u2014 research kindles hope for patients and their relatives who often reach out asking for more details.\n\nBut what did surprise me was the recent email I got, where the writer was emailing to know more \u2014 it came three years after the article was published.\n\nThis touched me on several counts. First, it brought home the thirst for scientific knowledge and the eagerness to probe and understand complex phenomena, among the readers. It was moving to think of the reader scouring the web for information that could help a loved one. Successful research, promising results and reactions of hope are what make it worth the while for science journalists who spend their time trying to make sense of the abstruse and simplifying it for the lay reader.\n\nSecond, the email underscored the reach of the medium of the Internet and the power of the published word. This reinforces in us journalists the need for rigour and commitment to facts in the reports we write. The role of the Internet in prolonging the life of stories is well known, but the ease with which a person can access an old story and also mail the writer for an update never fails to astonish.\n\nIn earlier days, when print was the dominant mode of communication, the combination of the short life span of stories and the time it took to establish communication with the writer worked to prevent such easy links between the reader, writer and the written. Back then, letters were the dominant mode of communication, and people travelled across the globe to confer, whereas now, instant messaging and Zoom conferences have made discussions easy to organise.\n\nThe Internet has taken us from daily, weekly and monthly schedules to round-the-clock planning. It has also played a role in amplifying and making immortal the written word. For reporters, it is an added responsibility to use the power of this medium in a manner consistent with journalistic values."}

Teachers, administrators and policymakers are all working, but the results are not encouraging. People at both ends of the classroom seem to be going through a mere exercise with precious little to show for their efforts. How much of learning is happening is anyone\u2019s guess. Exams have lost their credibility. The cost to health with continuous exposure to screens and the dent on financial resources are significant for both teachers and students. Online learning seems to be a case of working mindlessly, rather than working smart.\n\nWith physical classes out of the reckoning, access to education is now almost exclusively online. Internet penetration in India is 50% and that reveals one reason for the less-than-efficient achievement in the online education sector. Every single teacher-educator and student, even in the metros, has experienced poor connectivity. In the rural areas online access remains an aspiration. What happens to that child in the village government school, eager to learn but with no proper access to the Internet? Even if there is a selfless teacher who is willing to use his/her mobile hotspot, how much can he/she spend? The government has a solution right in its backyard.\n\nAlso read | Study highlights online education woes\n\nTwo influential agencies\n\nThe Government of India owns the airwaves. Prasar Bharati is India\u2019s broadcasting corporation handling both radio and television in India. All India Radio (AIR) is blessed with 470 broadcasting centres which cover 92% of the country\u2019s geographical area and 99.19% of our population. Doordarshan (DD) handles television, online and mobile broadcasting across our country and the world with 34 satellite channels, 17 well-equipped studios in State capitals and 49 studio centres in other cities. With such resources, AIR and DD can be used to broadcast lessons, given that education is one of the three functions of the two agencies under the Prasar Bharati Act. These two agencies can be reinvented to cater to the needs of the education sector.\n\nEducational broadcasts for classes 10, 11 and 12, to begin with, can be done over AIR and DD in the ratio 4:1 (four hours of radio and one hour of TV). Those courses which need demonstration and where seen/observed physical activity is important can be broadcast on TV. This calls for some training and some effort, but it can be done.\n\nThere are two benefits from this: one, we will be able to reduce for our teachers and students the strain of having to stare at their screens endlessly; and two, with AIR and DD being free, the heavy drain on financial resources will be drastically reduced.\n\nAlso read | Pros and cons of online education, from a student\u2019s perspective\n\nPolicymakers should make it a point to involve teachers in their planning. Training can be provided by a set of master trainers over a month for teachers who will turn into scriptwriters and programmers. These teachers can also be taught to create appropriate tools for evaluation over radio and TV. The Central and State educational boards should be roped in, to support, monitor and provide feedback to improve the system.\n\nIf regular radio is not enough, we also have digital radio spawning FM stations leased out to private players for a fee and several FM stations that are run by NGOs, universities and such agencies. My suggestion is this: let the AIR devote four hours (per class) to educational broadcasting and let DD undertake educational broadcasting for an hour (per class). With these two public broadcasting services combined in the ratio of 4:1 (per each class), we will be able to serve the entire student population of our country.\n\nAlso Read Amid online classes, schools devise digital detox routine\n\nFree hours of Internet\n\nAnother suggestion that the government could consider is to ask Internet Service Providers to provide many hours of free Internet usage to teachers and students. This will not be easy but the government should call the shots and take a decision that is in the interest of the people.\n\nJohn Varghese is Principal, St Stephen\u2019s College, Delhi"}

While the application on which it has been working has become obsolete, it has seen increased load over the years without any upgrade.\n\nWhen the system was developed in 2003, Kaveri application was meant to handle just about 10 modules, including document registration, property valuation, marriage registration, encumbrance search, and scanning archives among others. \u201cAs it successfully demonstrated its capacity, new tasks were imposed on it. In 17 years, about 20 more tasks that were not originally conceived have been added without any upgrade,\u201d a senior Revenue official told The Hindu.\n\nAlmost every day there is some technical issue in one of the integration applications belonging to other departments, which were not part of the original module, he rued.\n\nThe Kaveri system that is now critical in the land management system has been witnessing frequent shutdowns in the last few months with at least four reported Statewide shutdowns that brought registrations to a standstill.\n\nKaveri 1 is running on VB platform and Win XP operating system, both of which do not get the update support of Microsoft since they have become outdated. The decentralised system is further affected since the old hardware and inefficient power back up delays restoration of data due to maintenance efficiency of 282 local servers located in each office.\n\nSources pointed out apart from the original tasks, Kaveri now supports land related integrations from other departments such as Bhoomi, Mojini, e-Swathu, Upor, e-Aasthi, Sakala, Udyoga Mitra Portal, Khajane II, Moulya, Digilocker, BDA, BBMP, and PAN verification services. \u201cNot much focus is being given to upgrade the application or bring a new system that is robust and can handle newer integrations,\u201d said the source.\n\nOver the last five years, the Stamps and Registrations Department\u2019s transaction in over 280 sub-registrar\u2019s office alone has seen an increase. The number of documents registered has gone up from 19.71 lakh in 2015-2016 to 20.45 lakh in 2019-2020. In the same period, marriage registrations have increased from 1.21 lakh to 1.49 lakh, encumbrance certificates 27.75 lakh to 36.79 lakh, CCs from 6.86 lakh to 8.07 lakh.\n\nAnother officer said Kaveri was never meant to be interactive, but made partially interactive in the recent years. \u201cIt was meant to bring convenience in registrations. The number of steps used in registrations have gone from about 5 to 22 now. Ambitious plans such as sending OTP to the user during registrations has added pressure.

This automatic system delivers supplement oxygen based on the SpO2 levels and prevents the person from sinking in to a state of \u2018hypoxia\u2019, which is fatal in most cases.\n\nHypoxia is a state in which the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues is inadequate to fulfil all the energy requirements of the body. This is exactly the situation that a COVID patient may face leading to the current crisis, informed an official release.\n\nThe electronic hardware of the system is designed for functioning at extreme altitudes featuring low barometric pressures, low temperatures and humidity. The software safety checks incorporated into the system are critical in ensuring the functional reliability of the system in field conditions.\n\nThe system reads SpO2 levels of the subject from a wrist-worn pulse oximeter module through wireless interface and controls a proportional solenoid valve to regulate the oxygen supply. The oxygen is delivered from a lightweight portable cylinder through nasal prongs.\n\nThe system is available in various sizes from 1 litre and 1kg weight with 150 litres of oxygen supply to 10 litres and 10 kg weight with 1,500 litres of oxygen supply, which can sustain for 750 minutes with a continuous flow of two litres per minute.

The automatic usage has huge advantage in the household, as the oximeter would give an alarm for lower SpO2 value. It will automatically increase/decrease the O2 flow based on SpO2 setting, which can be auto adjusted at 2,5,7,10 litres per minute flow rate.\n\nThe simple-to-use facility greatly reduces the work load and exposure time of doctors and paramedics to monitor the SpO2 levels of patients.

Apart from a coherent plea to States to avoid total lockdowns and a romantic COVID-19 situational briefing of sorts, much of it was optimistic yet stultifying rhetoric that could hardly have any influence on mass behaviour towards COVID-19. Nonetheless, while much of the visual aspect of the Prime Minister\u2019s address was similar to the ones held last year, one conspicuous element was missing \u2014 that of a symbolic mask. While a number of alibis for the same are possible, it is an insignia that speaks volumes about our approach toward the second wave of COVID-19.\n\nAdministrative fatigue\n\nMedicine and social science are two essential pillars of public health. However, medical interventions have historically been the ones to usurp the public health space. Much to the detriment of public health, this has time and again resulted in a subconscious dismissal of social science-based approaches that hold the keys to the public health castle. The situation with the second wave is hardly different. In our besottedness with strategies such as mass vaccination, which although of unrivalled significance have considerable near-term limitations, the simplest yet most crucial behavioural interventions have been given a criminally light touch at a time when they were supposed to be accentuated.\n\nCoronavirus | Saving lives the bottom line, Delhi High Court tells Centre\n\nAnd this goes beyond the abomination of political rallies potentially spreading infection, or public representatives failing at crucial public messaging by not wearing masks themselves. Take the instance of a mofussil town that no longer sees honking vehicles traverse the streets every morning, airing social distancing and masking messages, unlike during the first wave. Or the near-disappearance after the first wave of rings drawn outside of a shopping store to encourage social distancing. Surmount these with counter-intuitive public policies at the grass-roots level, and you have a perfect recipe for a flaring pandemic.\n\nFor example, even before an official order was promulgated in Maharashtra, local police forced shops to remain open for only four hours during the day in certain localities, creating panic among customers and shopkeepers. The idea of limiting open-hours derives from the theoretical precept of rationing services to discourage over-consumption, much like waiting times. But the same fosters over-crowding, non-compliance with COVID-19-appropriate behaviour by both shopkeepers and customers, and is practically counterproductive when an infectious pandemic is in question.\n\nSimilarly, it is possible to locate beneficiaries lined up outside some vaccination centres from midnight till noon for physical tokens, while the politically well-connected get their way within minutes. All of these indicate that much like pandemic fatigue among the public, administrative and governance fatigue is real, and that the crucial lessons from the early days of the pandemic have been squandered rather than strengthened.\n\nAlso read | High Court concerned over Gujarat government\u2019s COVID-19 management\n\nPoor messaging\n\nAnother example of administrative fatigue, resulting from a subconscious dismissal of behavioural approaches, is the poor risk communication and public messaging that has accompanied the second wave. Health behaviours, once firmly embedded, are expected to be swiftly elicited on subsequent occasions. The concept is much like immunological memory where the body exerts a stronger response to a disease agent upon the second or third infection. Such embedded health behaviours in some East Asian countries have resulted in prompt and widespread public adoption of measures such as masking on the whiff of an infectious outbreak. The same cannot be expected for India given our lesser exposure to infectious pandemics. Nonetheless, a strong and subtle nudge was imperative during the second wave to quickly bring back COVID-19-appropriate behaviours with renewed vigour. This has failed, and that too during more pressing times than before.\n\nAlso read | SC wants national plan on COVID-19 situation\n\nAs is often humorously exclaimed, the worst way to calm someone down is by telling them to calm down. Reducing the risk communication strategy to simple messages such as \u201cplease wear masks\u201d is unlikely to work particularly in a setting of widespread pandemic fatigue, and where mixed signals are continuously disseminated by political representatives. Altering health behaviour, in addition to altering physical and social contexts, involves skilful and emphatic messaging that incentivises adoption of the right behaviours. Unfortunately, the public health messaging strategy during the second wave has been more generic, muffled, and far more equivocal than the first wave.\n\nA perspective\n\nAn over-medicalised public health emergency is a disaster superimposed on another. Multiple fundamental aspects of COVID-19 vaccines and the protection afforded by them still remain fuzzy. Further, there are non-negotiable aspects such as the lag between vaccination and protection, and the gargantuan challenge of vaccinating a large population as ours. Overcoming our preoccupation with medical solutions and looking at behavioural approaches as more than mere rituals will be imperative to combat this second wave.\n\nDr. Soham D.

After the tenure of former CJI Ranjan Gogoi, who oversaw the Ayodhya and Rafale verdicts, before retiring to join the Rajya Sabha, we thought the worst was behind us. We hoped that his successor, CJI S.A. Bobde would lift the Court out of this abyss and at least restore its independence from the executive. But, the nearly 18 months of his tenure has exposed a deep malaise in every aspect of dispensation of justice; from the administration of the Court; in the allocation of cases and benches; to presiding over matters related to the protection of civil liberties, securing the rights and the livelihood of the poor and marginalised; or in ensuring that the unconstitutional actions and policies of the executive are kept in check.\n\nMomentous months\n\nHis tenure began in November 2019 with many important cases before him. There were over 100 petitions challenging the dilution of Article 370 and the reorganisation of the State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) into Union Territories. Soon after he assumed office, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed, which led to another spate of petitions challenging its constitutionality. The CAA sparked widespread protests. We witnessed police confrontation at the Jamia University campus and the entry of gangs into Jawaharlal Nehru University who beat up students and teachers under the full gaze of the police. Thereafter, the city of Delhi witnessed engineered riots and the subsequent hounding of young students and other activists in the guise of an investigation by the Delhi Police. There were also other important cases pending before the Supreme Court, including the validity of electoral bonds, and the protection of Rohingya refugees. Then, early in 2020, COVID-19 overtook the country, and with it began the lockdown of the Supreme Court and thereafter other courts, and then the entire country \u2014 which led to the largest exodus of migrant labour from the large cities in India.\n\nAlso read | SC refuses to refer Article 370 matter to larger seven-judge Bench\n\nA powerful constitutional court like the Supreme Court of India must rise to these challenges, and it is in such challenging times that its mettle and independence is tested. It is here that the role of the Chief Justice of India \u2014 he is the master of the roster deciding the priority accorded to the hearing of cases, their allocation to Benches and setting the tone for the Court by his leadership \u2014 becomes critical.\n\nThe cases challenging the cataclysmic changes to the status of J&K remained unheard during his entire tenure as did the cases challenging the CAA. The main challenge to the electoral bonds and other changes to electoral funding, which have a fundamental bearing on our democracy, remained unheard. Applications for the stay of bonds being issued before every election, were never listed for hearing, and were eventually dismissed on the ground that the bonds had been around for several years; therefore, there was no need to stay them. Similarly, the main petition regarding the status of the Rohingya refugees and the protection to be accorded to them, remained unheard. An application to prevent their detention and deportation, was disposed of by Chief Justice Bobde, in complete disregard of constitutional and international law norms, on the basis that their fleeing genocide in Myanmar did not concern the Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court, under his stewardship, remained shut for physical hearing much of the time, resulting in fewer than 25% cases being heard in a Court, already reeling under a backlog and pendency of cases. Many habeas corpus petitions of people in detention were not heard for months, and thereafter summarily disposed of without deciding the main issue by relegating the petitioners to the High Courts.\n\nAlso read | Supreme Court refuses to order release of Rohingya refugees detained in Jammu\n\nMigrant labour exodus\n\nDuring the nationwide lockdown last year, the country witnessed unprecedented suffering by migrant labour; there was a mass exodus of them from the big cities, and they suffered a huge loss of livelihood and income. Without any public transport, they were forced to walk hundreds of miles to reach their villages. Their case for relief in terms of food, wages and transport was initially heard by the CJI\u2019s Bench. Unfortunately, the pleas on behalf of the migrant workers did not result in any relief to them with the Court saying it could not \u201csupplant\u201d the government\u2019s wisdom on providing relief to the lakhs of migrant labourers across the country. The CJI remarked infamously during one of the hearings, \u201cIf they are being provided meals, then why do they need money?\u201d It would be no exaggeration to say that the Court\u2019s inhumanity and apathy towards the distress of the poor and marginalised reached its nadir during this time.\n\nEditorial | Belated, but welcome: On Supreme Court move on migrant workers\n\nFar from being a custodian of citizens\u2019 rights, CJI Bobde, while hearing the Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan\u2019s habeas corpus petition (arrested while covering the infamous Hathras rape and murder case in Uttar Pradesh), noted that the Court had been discouraging people from approaching it under Article 32. Mr. Kappan\u2019s petition remained pending with repeated adjournments.\n\nIn the farmers\u2019 protest case, the CJI appointed a committee of people, whose political neutrality was suspect, to examine the issues and commence negotiations with the farmers. These committee members had publicly supported the farm laws in the past.\n\nAdministrative role\n\nApart from his role as the master of the roster, the CJI also plays a pivotal role in judicial appointments. Unfortunately, here too, he failed to carry the collegium with him, leading to no appointments to the Supreme Court during his tenure, and very few appointments even to the High Courts. He did not even order the government to issue notifications for the appointment of judges where the collegium had unanimously reiterated its recommendations, despite the government procrastinating over them for long. The law laid down by the Court says that these are binding on the government.\n\nThe Chief Justice of India also plays a critical role in dealing with complaints against judges. During his tenure, the CJI received a serious complaint made by a Chief Minister of a State against one of the Court judges, with considerable documentary evidence of questionable land purchases. For over six months, the people in the country were not informed how the complaint had been dealt with, and whether any in-house committee (as per the law) has been appointed to, who the members of the committee were, and what their report was.\n\nThe same lack of transparency was visible in another case, where he was chairman of a committee examining allegations of harassment made by a woman staffer of the Court against his predecessor. His report, purporting to give a clean chit to his predecessor, was never allowed to see the light of day and not even provided to the complainant.\n\nGreen cause\n\nI have tried to search for the redeeming features in the CJI\u2019s tenure. But to my dismay, the only positive intervention by CJI Bobde that I have been able to discover was his order in the West Bengal trees case, where he appointed an expert committee to examine the value of trees which are to be felled for any public project. In all other issues, the CJI has only caused disappointment with his silence, letting the executive have its way and even making strong remarks on sensitive issues and subjects. He has kept important matters pending, and has hardly intervened to provide any relief to the most marginalised or the weak in India.\n\nAs we bid farewell to Chief Justice of India Bobde, the Supreme Court must examine what has happened to what had once been called the most powerful court in the world and a beacon for many other courts across the world. As the Supreme Court turns the page on his tenure, let us hope that in the coming years, it can rebuild its legacy by asserting its judicial independence from the government and once again reclaiming its constitutional role as a citadel that establishes India\u2019s constitutional values, guards its democracy, and protects human rights and dignity.\n\nPrashant Bhushan is a senior public interest advocate practising at the Supreme Court of India"}

My symptoms are mild and am in home quarantine but my complaint is about inadequate testing facilities and the long time it takes to get the results, which I feel is causing more hospitalisations,\u201d he says.\n\nThe senior official, who also held key posts in the twin cities, wanted to get himself tested in a private laboratory after he realised the mild fever was refusing to go. \u201cI went to a diagnostic centre where I was informed that while the test could be done soon, the results can be expected in 72 hours only,\u201d he explains.\n\nHis question is \u2014 What should the probable COVID positive patient do in the meanwhile? \u201cIsn\u2019t there a danger of the virus spreading further in the body during this time with delayed medical assistance because of the late test result information?,\u201d he wonders.

If we can ramp up the RT-PCR testing facilities, ensure results in shortest possible time and begin medication as per doctors\u2019 advice, online or mobile too, we can not only save lives but prevent the rush to hospitals in critical stages. If private labs have managed to enhance their capabilities in the last one year, what prevents the government to scale them up?,\u201d he asks.\n\nThe official is of the opinion that more people are voluntarily coming forward for testing this year. So, the health department on its own or on a public-private partnership should open more testing centres and provide quicker results to cut the serpentine queues in government healthcare facilities.\n\n(Readers can share their own experiences or suggest healthcare improvements on our Twitter handle @THHyderabad or mail them to hyderabaddesk@thehindu.co.

He also pointed out to partiality towards Gujarat, and neglect towards Telangana.\n\nRemdesivir is manufactured by at least two companies in and around Hyderabad. Till Wednesday, the State was procuring it directly. Mr. Rajender said that the Central government had issued an order on April 21 stating that they would take control over Remdesivir injections, other vaccines and oxygen.\n\n\u201cThis is so saddening,\u201d he said. Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan was informed of the issue, but there was no response.\n\nHe said that while the State was allotted only 21,551 vials of Remdesivir, Gujarat was allotted 1.63 lakh vials, Maharashtra 2 lakh vials, 61,000 to Delhi, and 92,000 to Madhya Pradesh.\n\n60-70% from other States\n\nMr. Rajender said that around 60-70% of patients admitted in hospitals in Hyderabad were from other States. Usually, patients from Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Maharashtra get admitted to hospitals in the city.\n\nThe Minister mentioned this to drive home the point that patients from various States get treated in the city, and meagre allocation of the antiviral drug or other resources would create a crisis.\n\n\u201cWe cannot impose a condition to admit patients only from our State. As the entire nation is in crisis, it is our responsibility to treat patients from everywhere. They should not face any issues. We placed order for 4 lakh vials of Remdesivir. I will write a letter to Union Health Minister,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, Telangana requires around 260-270 metric tonnes of oxygen per day, and the demand may go up to 350 metric tonnes per day, he said. Mr. Rajender said that oxygen was procured from other States, not from Telangana.\n\nAround 20 metric tonnes of oxygen is procured from Bellary, 30 more from Hospet, 20 from Chennai and 84 from Odisha.\n\n\u201cGetting oxygen from places as far as 1,300 km is difficult. Special tankers are needed for that. We asked Dr. Harsh Vardhan to allocate oxygen from nearby places like Visakhapatnam, Sriperumbudur, and Bellary. If the Central government does not change its stance, it will have to take responsibility if there is any shortage,\u201d he said.\n\nVaccine crunch\n\nShortage of COVID vaccines too, was pointed out at the presser. The Health Minister said that had vaccine production been increased, we would not have seen the shortage. He said that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had asked for increase in production.\n\n\u201cOur suggestions were not considered,\u201d he said, calling out varying prices of vaccines for Central and State governments."}

Between 45,000 and 54,000 other casualties were \u201ccommemorated unequally.\u201d\n\nThe treatment of these soldiers, who served in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, contrasts with that of the men and women who died in Europe. It also violates the principle that all war dead should be remembered in the same way because they all made the same enormous sacrifice.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the government, both of the time and today, I want to apologize for the failures to live up to their founding principles all those years ago and express deep regret that it has taken so long to rectify the situation,\u201d Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said in the House of Commons. \u201cWhilst we can\u2019t change the past, we can make amends and take action.\u201d\n\nThe commission was created in 1917 to ensure that all who died in the service of the British Empire during World War I were identified and properly honored. Its responsibilities were later expanded to include those who died during World War II, and it now oversees the graves of 1.7 million men and women who died during the two wars.\n\nThe commission appointed an independent panel to investigate claims of unequal treatment following a 2019 TV documentary presented by David Lammy, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party, that focused on the way African casualties were commemorated. One researcher who worked on the documentary said she had forwarded information about her concerns to the commission more than a decade earlier but no action was taken.\n\nThe investigation found that tens of thousands of service personnel who died in Africa, Asia and the Middle East either weren\u2019t commemorated at all or were only honored anonymously on collective memorials. Others had their names recorded on paper registers rather than stone monuments. The battlefield graves of thousands more were abandoned without the remains ever being identified.\n\nIn Europe, the commission attempted to identify all of the dead and bury their remains under identical white headstones that still dot cemeteries from France to Turkey. The names of those who couldn\u2019t be identified were recorded on mass memorials.\n\n\u201cNo apology can ever make up for the indignity suffered by the unremembered,\u2033 Lammy said. \u201cHowever, this apology does offer the opportunity for us as a nation to work through this ugly part of our history \u2014 and properly pay our respects to every soldier who has sacrificed their life for us.\u201d\n\nDavid Olusoga, a professor of public history at the University of Manchester, said World War I changed British culture, in part because of the powerful way that the dead were remembered.\n\n\u201c(Yet) when it came to men who were black and brown and Asian and African, it is not equal. Particularly the Africans, who have been treated in a way that is \u2026 apartheid in death,\u2033 he told the BBC. \u201cIt is an absolute scandal.\u201d\n\nThe inequality was rooted in the \u201cimperial ideology\u201d of British and colonial authorities in the years immediately after World War I, the investigation found. For instance, the officer in charge of graves registration in East Africa asserted that central memorials were the most appropriate way to commemorate the dead because most Africans \u201cdo not attach any sentiment\u201d to the graves of their dead.\n\n\u201cSweeping judgements such as these, which chose to ignore the intricacies of faith, culture and customs in Africa outside Christian and Islamic traditions, played a significant role in shaping the (commission\u2019s) policies that led to unequal treatment,\u201d the panel said.\n\nThese attitudes were adopted at the highest levels of the British government. Winston Churchill, then-Secretary of State for the Colonies, in 1921 signed a document directing that collective memorials, rather than individual headstones, should be erected for African troops in Africa.\n\nIn response to the panel\u2019s findings, the commission said it would continue to search for the names of African, Asian and Middle Eastern casualties and add their names to its records. It also promised to be more flexible in the evidence required to support requests for commemoration in light of the panel\u2019s concerns about the availability of paper records.\n\nThe commission also said it would improve transparency about this issue on its website and set up an expert panel to advise it.\n\n\u201cWe apologize unreservedly for the historical wrongs found in this report and for failing to live up to founding principle, of `equality of treatment in death,\u2019\u201d the commission said."}

I know we got it wrong. I know we made a mistake and for that I'm sorry and sincerely apologize,'' said Ford, who appeared to choke back tears at one point.But Ford said he won't resign despite widespread calls for him to do so.He also suggested his government will offer province-paid paid sick leave for Covid-19 patients, but announced no details. The lack of such a program has led to widespread complaints.The pandemic restrictions Ford's government announced last Friday immediately ran into opposition. Police departments insisted they wouldn't use new powers to randomly stop pedestrians or motorists and doctors complained the rules focused on outdoor activities like playgrounds and golf rather than more dangerous indoor settings.Restaurants, gyms and classrooms across the province already had been closed. Most nonessential workers are working from home.On Saturday, Ford retracted the ban on playgrounds, though outdoor recreation activities such as golf remain forbidden in Ontario, the only jurisdiction in North America that now bans it.Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada, but health experts say more-contagious variants and a failure to take the right measures against the virus has led to a third wave of infections in Ontario.Ford himself is isolating after a staff member tested positive.``Ford chose to walk people into a catastrophic third wave. He chose politics over public health. Today, he offered nothing,'' opposition New Democratic Party leader Andrea Horwath tweeted. ``Ford must pass paid sick days, close non-essential businesses & send vaccines to hotspots. Today.''"}

The renewed jump in Covid infections in several parts of the country and the associated localised and regional lockdowns add uncertainty to the growth outlook,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the governor said in the minutes of the MPC (monetary policy committee) meeting, which was released by the RBI on Thursday.\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn such an environment, monetary policy should remain accommodative to support, nurture and consolidate the recovery. We need to continue to sustain the impulses of growth in the new financial year 2021-22. I vote to keep the policy rate unchanged and to continue with the accommodative stance as long as necessary to sustain growth on a durable basis, while ensuring that inflation remains within the target going forward,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Das had said.While the RBI expectedly kept rates on hold, it had surprised markets by announcing a Rs 1-lakh-crore government bond purchase programme, which helped bring down interest rates. While the RBI did reiterate its accommodative stance while announcing the MPC decision, a reading of the minutes emphasises the dovish stance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing forward, The RBI would continue to ensure ample surplus systemic liquidity and the system would remain in surplus even after meeting the requirements of all financial market segments and the productive sectors of the economy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Das had said in the MPC meeting.He had said that indicators suggest that the real GDP was evolving on the lines of the February MPC resolution.\u00e2\u0080\u009cImproving demand conditions, investment enhancing measures by the government and improving external demand impart an upside to growth prospects. The recent jump in Covid infections and its impact on economic activity, however, needs to be watched carefully,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Das had cautioned.Deputy governor Michael Patra had also expressed concern over recovery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMonetary policy has to remain supportive of the economy until the recovery is more sure-footed and its sustainability assured,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. He pointed out that risks to the recovery have become accentuated since the MPC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s February meeting with new waves of infections and the inexorably slow pace of vaccinations, moderation in several high-frequency sentiment indicators, global risks and spillovers.\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe economic recovery can come under risk if this new wave of infections is not flattened soon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mridul Saggar, executive director, RBI and a member of the MPC. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is especially so as monetary and fiscal policies have already used most of their space to considerably limit the loss of economic capital, though expansion of policy toolkits can still afford additional comfort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added."}

Lenders said, unlike last year when they got additional credit lines and relief in the form of a moratorium , small businesses do not have enough cash to see them through a prolonged shutdown.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhile it is too early to comment on the extent of the impact on the asset quality of retail loans due to the rising Covid cases, there is reason to be cautious. After the nationwide lockdown last year, we had witnessed a severe drop in collections for most asset classes though the availability of a moratorium provided a breather from an NPA-recognition perspective,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abhishek Dafria, VP and head (structured finance) at Icra.\n\nDafria added that while the current restrictions are localised and less harsh, the severity has been gradually increasing as the surge in Covid cases is yet to be brought under control. Pointing out that last year it was microfinance and unsecured SME loans that had the highest delinquencies after the lockdown period, he said that the risk categorisation would remain similar for areas that see stronger government restrictions.\n\nAccording to lenders, they would be helpless if the loans slip into non-performing asset ( NPA ) category as then no further relief can be given and they would have to initiate recovery proceedings. Last year, in addition to the moratorium and emergency credit line, a SC order had prevented banks from classifying delinquencies after the Covid outbreak as NPAs.\n\nSince default by small businesses could result in credit freeze to this segment, the RBI might be forced to look at a moratorium if the lockdown restrictions get extended geographically and extend for a longer period.The Finance Industry Development Council, which represents NBFCs, has written to the RBI seeking an extension of the one-time restructuring of MSME advances till March 2022, as the companies are yet to revive their businesses due to the surge in Covid cases.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDue to the severe second wave of COVID-19, the MSMEs as also the retail and wholesale trader industry have not been able to revive their economic activities and therefore are in urgent need of support from the lenders. Various surveys and reports are forewarning that the operating environment for banks will most likely remain challenging, as the second wave could dent the sluggish recovery in consumer and corporate confidence, and further, suppress banks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prospects for new business,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the council said in its letter to the RBI governor.\n\nAccording to bankers, the combination of moratorium and emergency credit line guarantee scheme in the previous year helped to protect banks, NBFCs and small businesses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLast year, the additional line of credit enabled some of the small business to clear expensive loans to NBFCs and the moratorium provided relief until business started. This time around, many small businesses will not have the capacity to remain afloat if the lockdown is extended,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a senior banker.\n\n"}

Realtors warned that expensive homes could become a permanent feature of the market, worsening inequality.\n\nEven as the economy is booming and the labor market scars are healing thanks to massive public aid from the government and increased Covid-19 vaccinations, there are still 17.4 million people collecting unemployment checks.\n\n\"We are seeing claims drop across most states, which shows the jobs recovery has become more geographically broad-based,\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.\n\n\"However, a growing number of Americans are out of work for longer, and it's those who are tougher to bring back into the labor force.\"\n\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 39,000 to a seasonally adjusted 547,000 for the week ended April 17, the lowest since mid-March 2020, the labor department said.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast 617,000 applications for the latest week.\n\nIt was the second straight week that claims were below the 700,000 level since March 2020 when mandatory shutdowns of non-essential businesses like restaurants and bars were enforced to slow the first wave of Covid-19 infections.\n\nThere were large declines in filings in Texas and New York, as well as decreases in several other states.\n\nClaims have remained elevated because of fraud, especially in California and Ohio. The enhancement of the unemployment benefits programs, including a weekly $300 subsidy, could also be encouraging some people to attempt to file a claim for assistance, though not every application is approved.\n\nThe latest labor department data on first payments show only a fraction of claims were successful over the past months.\n\nThe weekly subsidy and the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program will run through September 6. Claims jumped to a record 6.149 million in early April 2020. In a healthy labor market, claims are normally in a range of 200,000 to 250,000.\n\nIncluding the PUA program, 699,798 people filed claims last week, squeaking below 700,000 for the first time since the pandemic started.\n\nStocks on Wall Street were mixed. The dollar gained versus a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.\n\nBroad improvement\n\nThe United States has expanded Covid-19 vaccination eligibility to most American adults, and more than half that population has had at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A third of US adults are fully vaccinated, as well as 26% of the population overall, it said.\n\nThat, together with the White House's $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package, has allowed for broader economic re-engagement. The resulting surge in demand has left businesses scrambling for workers. Retail sales raced to a record high in March and factories are humming.\n\nLast week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of April's employment report. First-time filings have dropped from 765,000 in mid-March, boosting hopes for strong employment gains in April.\n\nThe economy created 916,000 jobs in March, the most in seven months. Employment, however, remains 8.4 million jobs below its peak in February 2020.\n\n\"Job growth in the spring of 2021 is receiving a boost as better weather allows for more outdoor activity,\" said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Job growth will remain very strong throughout 2021 and into 2022 thanks to vaccination efforts and stimulus payments that are supporting consumer spending.\"\n\nBut the housing market is backpedaling. Existing home sales dropped 3.7% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.01 million units last month, the lowest level since August 2020, the National Association of Realtors said in a separate report on Thursday.\n\nThe plunge reflected a supply squeeze, which boosted the median house price a record 17.2% from a year ago to an all-time high of $329,100.\n\nSales are skewed towards large and more expensive homes. The NAR reported intense bidding wars, which it said could lead to discrimination against some buyers.\n\n\"Without an increase in supply, the society wealth division will widen with homeowners enjoying sizable equity gains while renters will struggle to become homeowners,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the NAR.\n\nStill, housing remains supported by the recovering labor market. The claims report showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid decreased 34,000 to 3.674 million in the week ended April 10.\n\nThe so-called continuing claims have declined from 23.1 million at the height of the crisis. Part of the drop is likely because of people finding work and exhausting their eligibility for benefits, which is limited to 26 weeks in most states.\n\nAbout 5.6 million people were on extended benefits during the week ended April 3. Another 492,999 were on a state program for those who have exhausted their initial six months of aid. There were 17.405 million people receiving benefits under all programs in early April.\n\n"}

Brian Kemp on Wednesday announced that he had appointed the Rev. Abraham Mosley to serve as chairman of the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, the state authority responsible for overseeing Stone Mountain Park about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta. The park is a popular hiking and tourist site but is replete with Confederate imagery.\n\nMosley, pastor of Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church in Athens, Georgia, was previously a member of the association's board. His elevation to chairman comes as the park's Confederate symbols face renewed opposition, with some calling on park leaders to stop maintaining its signature feature - a colossal sculpture of Gen. Robert E. Lee, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gen. Thomas J. \"Stonewall\" Jackson that is carved into the mountain's northern face.\n\nAssociation CEO Bill Stephens told WSB-TV the board will hear ideas at a meeting on Monday about how to change the park in ways he thinks will balance its historical record.\n\nMosley urged patience.\n\n\"Certainly, there are mounting problems that have been brought before us. But we've got to handle them one at a time,\" he told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nKemp said in a statement that he was confident Mosley would \"continue to rely on his experience in bringing people together\" as chairman of the association.\n\nThe Stone Mountain Action Coalition, an advocacy group, last year proposed that the association remove Confederate flags at the base of the mountain, change the names of streets and other park features with Confederate affiliations and refocus the park on themes such as racial reconciliation and justice. Meymoona Freeman, a leader of the group, said it wanted to see the carving of Lee, Davis and Jackson transformed into a natural space. The sculpture has special protection enshrined in Georgia law, which calls on the Stone Mountain Memorial Association to protect the site as a \"Confederate Memorial and public recreation area,\" according to the association's website.\n\nThe Stone Mountain Action Coalition said in a statement it was \"encouraged\" by Mosley's appointment.\n\n\"It is our hope that the appointment of Reverend Mosley to this position of leadership is the first of many changes at this public park that will result in the immediate and complete removal of symbols, monuments, flags, street, place and building names, events and activities that honor and celebrate the Confederacy and the Ku Klux Klan,\" the Stone Mountain Action Coalition said in a statement.\n\n"}

Read More\n\nKABUL: The US military has begun shipping equipment and winding down contracts with local service providers ahead of the May 1 start of the final phase of its military pullout from Afghanistan , a US Defense Department official said Thursday.\n\nThe pullout under US President Joe Biden marks the end of America's longest war after a 20-year military engagement. Currently, some 2,500 US soldiers and about 7,000 allied forces are still in Afghanistan.\n\nIn February last year, the US military began closing its smaller bases. In mid-April, the Biden administration announced that the final phase of the withdrawal would begin May 1 and be completed before Sept. 11.\n\nSince then, the military has been shipping equipment and winding down local contracts for services such as trash pickup and maintenance work, the US official told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with briefing regulations.\n\nWhile preparations are under way, troops likely won't begin to depart for a few weeks, he said, adding that \"we won't see a coming down of the (troop) numbers\" until remaining bases close.\n\nThere have been indications that the pullout could be completed well before Sept. 11, which marks the 20th anniversary of the al-Qaida terror attack on the U.S. and the trigger for the US invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nOn Wednesday, Germany's Defense Ministry said discussions are underway among military planners with the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Kabul for a possible withdrawal of international troops from Afghanistan as early as July 4.\n\nIn the short term, America will likely increase its troop presence in Afghanistan, the Pentagon said last Friday. The additional troops would be in Afghanistan over the coming weeks and months to help with what the herculean task of wrapping up 20 years of war.\n\nWhile much of the equipment headed back to the US will be shipped by air, the military will also use land routes through Pakistan and north through Central Asia, the Defense Department official said.\n\nThe U.S. equipment that is neither shipped back to America nor given to the Afghan National Security forces will be sold to contractors, who will, in turn, sell it in the local markets.\n\n\"You'll most likely start seeing it eventually showing up in bazaars as scrap,\" said the official.\n\nThe Taliban, meanwhile, were non-committal when asked by the AP whether the insurgents would attack departing US and NATO troops. \"It's too early for these issues, nothing can be said about the future,\" said Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem.\n\nIn a deal the Taliban signed last year with former President Donald Trump , the final US withdrawal deadline was set as May 1. Under the agreement, the Taliban promised not to attack US and NATO troops but they also later promised \"consequences\" if Washington defied the May 1 deadline.\n\n"}

Read More\n\nWASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden on Thursday pledged to cut US greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 52 per cent by the end of this decade. With this, Biden reverses the hands-off policy of his isolationist and science-sceptic predecessor Donald Trump , restoring a global approach in an interdependent world in the throes of a pandemic.\n\nForty world leaders -- including heads from China, India, Russia, Japan, and UK -- pitched their views and ideas at a virtual summit where Biden, introduced by his vice-president Kamala Harris, called the need for addressing global warming \"a moral imperative, an economic imperative.\"\n\n\"The signs are unmistakable. The science is undeniable. The cost of inaction is mounting,\" he said in his opening remarks, vowing that US would do its part to cut its 2005 level emissions by 50 to 52 per cent by 2030. He further asserted that his approach will create jobs and boost economies.\n\nThe White House said the US President's goal roughly doubles a target set by President Barack Obama in 2015 as part of the Paris climate accord, and he plans to formalise the new goal in a submission to the United Nations.\n\nBiden's pledge will require a fundamental change in the \"American way of life\" cherished by the country's nativist base, premised on unsparing and uncaring use of fossil fuels and hydrocarbons. A $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan which includes a clean energy standard to achieve net zero emissions in the power sector by 2035 and money to electrify the vehicle fleet are among the steps the Biden administration had proposed. The plan triggered resentment in mostly Trumpian circle of climate change sceptics which believes Washington should not worry about the rest of the world and simply do what is best for the American economy that thrives on consumption.\n\nIllustrative of the common global concern on the issue despite severe differences on other matters, leaders of Russia, China, India, Japan, Canada, UK and others -- many with serious on-going bilateral spats -- joined the virtual summit to broadly align themselves with the overall goal of reducing emissions.\n\nBiden, who spoke from the East Room of the White House decorated with plants and greenery on the occasion of Earth Day , was later joined by Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and climate czar John Kerry as Washington returned to a leadership role to tackle a global crisis that has momentarily taken a backseat due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"No nation can solve this crisis on our own, as I know you all fully understand all of us, all of us and particularly those of us who represent the world's largest economies. We have to step up,\" he said in words that could well apply to the pandemic.\n\nIn his speech, Prime Minister Modi made no new commitments but announced an India-US climate and clean energy partnership to mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies, and enable green collaborations. He also maintained that India's per capita emissions are far smaller than other major emitters -- a pointed rebuttal to global powers often putting China, which has five times more emissions than India, in the same basket.\n\n"}

I know we got it wrong. I know we made a mistake and for that I'm sorry and sincerely apologize,'' said Ford, who appeared to choke back tears at one point.But Ford said he won't resign despite widespread calls for him to do so.He also suggested his government will offer province-paid paid sick leave for Covid-19 patients, but announced no details. The lack of such a program has led to widespread complaints.The pandemic restrictions Ford's government announced last Friday immediately ran into opposition. Police departments insisted they wouldn't use new powers to randomly stop pedestrians or motorists and doctors complained the rules focused on outdoor activities like playgrounds and golf rather than more dangerous indoor settings.Restaurants, gyms and classrooms across the province already had been closed. Most nonessential workers are working from home.On Saturday, Ford retracted the ban on playgrounds, though outdoor recreation activities such as golf remain forbidden in Ontario, the only jurisdiction in North America that now bans it.Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada, but health experts say more-contagious variants and a failure to take the right measures against the virus has led to a third wave of infections in Ontario.Ford himself is isolating after a staff member tested positive.``Ford chose to walk people into a catastrophic third wave.

However, later it was transpired that it was a split decision with Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, who had headed the bench, accepted his bail petition, while the other member, Justice Asjad Javed Ghural, had opposed it.\n\nOn this, the chief justice constituted a three-member bench to decide the matter.\n\nInterestingly, Justice Ghural had accused Justice Dogar of issuing the bail granting short order \u00e2\u0080\u0098unilaterally'.\n\n\"It is shocking for me to observe here that it has been mentioned in the beginning paragraph of the said order that unanimous order qua grant of bail to the petitioner was announced, which is against the ground reality,\" Justice Gural had said.\n\nOn Thursday, the three-member bench (a referee bench) issued a short court order granting Shehbaz bail against furnishing two bail bonds worth PKR 5 million each. Shehbaz is expected be be released from jail on Friday.\n\nShehbaz was arrested in September 2020 in both cases by the National Accountability Bureau .\n\nThe NAB had alleged that Shehbaz's family had assets of around PKR 16.5 million till 1990, which increased to over PKR 7 billion in 2018 which were disproportionate to his known sources of income.\n\nThe NAB has already filed a case against Shehbaz in the accountability court. Shehbaz's counsel told the court since no investigation was pending against his client in these cases as the NAB had already filed a case against him, he should be granted bail.\n\nShehbaz is accused of beneficiary of assets held in the name of his family members and benamidars who had no sources to acquire such assets. NAB says, \"Shehbaz and other suspects committed offences of corruption and corrupt practices as envisaged under the provisions of the National Accountability Ordinance 1999 and money laundering as delineated in the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2010.\"\n\nA total of 20 people had been nominated in the case. The other main suspects are Shehbaz's wife Nusrat, his sons Hamza (leader of opposition in Punjab assembly) and Suleman (who is absconding in the UK), and his daughters Rabia Imran and Javeria Ali.\n\nShehbaz's elder brother Nawaz Sharif has been in London since November 2019 on 'medical grounds'. The Imran Khan government has declared Sharif an absconder and cancelled his passport.\n\nNawaz left the country after the court granted him bail in the Al-Azizia Mills corruption case in which he was undergoing seven years imprisonment in Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore. He was also granted four-week bail on medical grounds to have his treatment abroad. The government declared him an absconder after he failed to justify prolonging his stay in London.\n\n"}

The rate of growth in Afghanistan could enhance by two per cent in a stable and connected Afghanistan, we have to work together.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo, there are two options\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 Connect to Central Asia through us, share in the joint prosperity through the partnership for peace, gain international credibility and support that they're all in need of, or opt for chaos,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nThe country that would be most damaged by insecurity or a renewed civil war in Afghanistan is Pakistan, and in that case, it would be a lose proposition, Ghani said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's a moment of choice for Pakistan. All its calculations have been wrong,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Afghanistan President said.\n\nAfghanistan has in the past accused Pakistan of providing safe havens for terror groups that target its territory, especially the Afghan Taliban , the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and the Haqqani group.\n\nResponding to a question, Ghani said that China is not an interventionist power.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does not want to get engaged with military or proxy wars, and Pakistan in terms of its foreign policy obviously is hedging between China and other countries, because it is still, its reliance on the rest of the region is quite significant. Pakistan can become an anchor of regional stability if it opts for peace in regional cooperation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nThe discourse of Pakistan has changed, he said, adding that there was a security conference in Islamabad where the talk was really significantly about harmony and cooperation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo expect that China, after the great COVID reset and the significant adverse impact will get involved in regional conflicts directly, I think is remote. Furthermore, we have a lot of positive relationships with China and the growth of China now is going to be the factor as growth of India for regional prosperity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of us are strong stakeholders not to get involved. And for Afghanistan, we do not want a replacement in terms of seeking to replace the United States and NATO with some form of patronage. We want to have a multi-aligned policy where we are friends with everybody and not part of their quarrels, and hence our agenda of permanent neutrality that will benefit everybody,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ghani said.\n\nResponding to a question on the withdrawal of US troops from his country by September 11, he said that this is a time of opportunity for Afghanistan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor the Taliban and for Pakistan, it's a moment of choice. Will they opt to become a credible international stakeholder, with rules of game for a peaceful part of Asia and connectivity, or for opting for chaos?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEqually for the Taliban, the major excuse that this is a war to get the international forces out of Afghanistan is over. There is no religious justification left for the war. Political settlement is a must. But the ball clearly is in the court of Taliban and their supporters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ghani added.\n\nUS President Joe Biden last week announced that the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan will start on May 1 and will be completed by September 11 this year, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in New York.\n\nHe said: \"It is time to end America's longest war. It is time for American troops to come home.\"\n\nBiden has said that India, Pakistan, Russia, China, and Turkey have a significant stake in the stable future of Afghanistan and these regional stakeholders should do more to bring peace in this war-torn country.\n\n"}

The India-UK relationship could play a significant role in the containment of these practices,\" it states. \"The potential for the UK to use the ETP, and even the launch of FTA negotiations to lock the Indian government into a broader coalition of willing partners could be a game-changer for the Indo-Pacific region.\"\n\nThe UK, India and the existing CPTPP countries constitute around half of the global economy.\n\n\"Many countries have sought to do a trade deal with India, but these have proved notoriously difficult to close. It is possible that the UK has the key to unlock the Indian puzzle,\" Singham writes.\n\nHe states an FTA would have commercial benefits to both countries. The UK would like to see Scotch whisky tariffs reduced and greater access for UK financial, legal and professional services in India. India wants the UK to be more accommodating of business and student visas, in particular for IT executives. If the UK lowers its tariff schedule further below the EU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Common External Tariff and diverges from EU bans on products, then Indian agriculture could substantially benefit too, it adds.\n\nBut the report warns that FTAs are \"irrelevant if the rule of law and contracts are flouted, or if anticompetitive market distortions are the order of the day\".\n\nCiting the cases of Vodafone, Cairn Energy and Devas Multimedia Pvt Ltd, the report raises concerns that the Indian government is \"systematically breaking bilateral investment treaties (BITs), ignoring court and arbitration rulings, cancelling contracts, expropriating private property and using state institutions to prosecute the very parties whose rights they should be protecting\".\n\nSingham urges Johnson in his talks with Modi to push the Indian government to recognise and respect its existing commitments under bilateral investment treaties.\n\n\"Future British investors in India will expect the Indian government to abide by the BIT, including arbitration judgments. If this cannot be certain, then why would any investor feel confident about the provisions of a future FTA?\" the report asks.\n\n"}

Read More\n\nMOSCOW: Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said in an emotional message from behind bars Thursday that he felt \"pride and hope\" after learning from his lawyer about the mass protests demanding his freedom that swept Russia the previous night.\n\n\"Here it is - the salvation of Russia. You. Those who came out. Those who didn't come out but supported it. Those who didn't support it publicly, but sympathized,\" Navalny said in an Instagram post.\n\nThe 44-year-old, who is in his fourth week of hunger strike, said he hadn't known \"what was really happening\" because he only has access to one TV channel in prison, but his lawyer visited him on Thursday and got him up to speed about the events on Wednesday. \"And, I will sincerely say, two feelings are raging inside me: pride and hope.\"\n\n\"People are marching in the street. It means they know and understand everything,\" said Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin 's most prominent opponent. \"They won't give up their future, the future of their children, their country. Yes, it will be difficult and dark for some time. But those pulling Russia back historically are doomed. There are more of us in any case. Russia will be happy.\"\n\nMass street protests in support of Navalny swept dozens of cities and smaller towns across Russia on Wednesday night. The largest crowds were seen in Moscow, where thousands marched down the city center amid a heavy police presence.\n\nUnlike on past occasions, officers in riot gear didn't interfere with the rally in the Russian capital, allowing quickly growing crowds to swarm streets and squares for several hours. According to OVD-Info, a rights group that monitors political arrests and offers legal aid, police detained only 31 people in Moscow, which usually accounts for the vast majority of arrests across the country.\n\nBut overall, OVD-Info tallied more than 1,900 arrests across the country on Wednesday night, with more than 800 occurring in St. Petersburg.\n\nIt was unclear whether the demonstrations matched the size and intensity of the nationwide protests that broke out in January after Navalny was arrested.\n\nLeonid Volkov, Navalny's top strategist and chief of staff, maintained in the YouTube live stream about the protests that Wednesday's turnout exceeded January's, while the number of arrests was several times lower.\n\nIndependent political analyst and former Kremlin speechwriter Abbas Gallyamov believes the turnout on Wednesday was somewhat comparable to that in January, indicating that the harsh crackdown that followed previous demonstrations hasn't scared off Navalny's supporters.\n\nHundreds of people were jailed in the aftermath of the January demonstrations, and a number of Navalny allies were slapped with criminal charges for allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions.\n\n\"In recent months, the authorities have made very serious attempts to (discourage protests) by tightening the screws, and many - including me - had serious concerns that much fewer people would turn up,\" Gallyamov told The Associated Press Thursday.\n\nNavalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin - accusations Russian officials reject.\n\nSoon after, a court found that the politician's stay in Germany violated the terms of his suspended sentence for a 2014 embezzlement conviction, and ordered him to serve 2 1/2 years in prison.\n\nNavalny began the hunger strike to protest prison authorities' refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and numbness in his legs. Officials insisted Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs.\n\nNavalny's doctors said last week that the politician's test results showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys. He \"could die at any moment,\" his physician Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin said in a Facebook post.\n\nNavalny's allies had called the Wednesday protest in light of the alarming news, saying his life was at stake.\n\n"}

Read More\n\nJERUSALEM: A Syrian anti-aircraft missile landed in southern Israel early Thursday, setting off air raid sirens near the country's top-secret nuclear reactor, the Israeli military said. In response, it said it attacked the missile launcher and air-defense systems in neighboring Syria.\n\nIsraeli media later described the Syrian missile as an \"errant\" projectile, not a deliberate attack deep inside Israel. In recent years, Israel has repeatedly launched air strikes at Syria, including at military targets linked to foes Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah militia, both allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad. Such strikes routinely draw Syrian anti-aircraft fire. Thursday's exchange was unusual because the Syrian projectile landed deep inside Israel.\n\nSyria's state news agency SANA said the exchange began with an Israeli air strike on Dumeir, a suburb of the capital of Damascus . Dumeir is believed to house Syrian army installations and batteries as well as bases and weapons depots belonging to Iran-backed militias. SANA said four soldiers were wounded.\n\nThe Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , an opposition war monitoring group based in Britain that tracks Syria's civil war, said the Israeli strikes hit an air defense base belonging to the Syrian military and destroyed air defense batteries in the area. It said the Syrian military fired surface-to-air missiles in response.\n\nSyrian media made no mention of an anti-aircraft missile landing deep inside Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military described the projectile that landed near the nuclear site as a surface-to-air missile, which is usually used for air defense against warplanes or other missiles. That could suggest the Syrian missile had targeted Israeli warplanes but missed and flew off errantly. However, Dimona, the Negev desert town where Israel's nuclear reactor is located, is some 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of Damascus, a long range for an errantly fired surface-to-air missile.\n\nThe Israeli army said it had deployed a missile defense system to intercept the projectile and that there had been no damage. The Israeli military later said in a statement that an initial investigation indicated that the Syrian missile was not intercepted.\n\nThe air raid sirens were sounded in Abu Krinat, a village just a few kilometers (miles) from Dimona. Explosions heard across Israel might have been the air-defense systems.\n\nApparent missile fragments were found in a swimming pool in Ashalim, a community approximately 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Dimona. Israeli troops arrived at the scene and collected the fragments.\n\nThe military said that in response to the incoming missile, it launched an air strike at the battery that launched the anti-aircraft missile and other surface-to-air batteries in Syria.\n\nThe exchange between Israel and Syria comes against the backdrop of growing tensions between Israel and Iran, a key ally of Syria. Iran, which maintains troops and proxies in Syria, has accused Israel of a series of attacks on its nuclear facilities, including sabotage at its Natanz nuclear facility on April 11, and vowed revenge. It also threatened to complicate U.S.-led attempts to revive the international nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n"}

Economic pressure, coupled with the growing uncertainty over when vaccines will be widely available in the Islamic Republic, have many simply giving up on social distancing, considering it an unaffordable luxury. That has public health officials worried the worst of the pandemic still may be yet to come.\"I cannot stop working,\" said Mostafa Shahni, a worried 34-year-old construction worker in Tehran. \"If I do, I can't bring home bread for my wife and two kids.\"Iran is now reporting its highest-ever new coronavirus case numbers - more than 25,000 a day. Its daily death toll has surged to around 400, still below the grim record of 486 it reached in November.During the peak of Iran's last surge, around 20,000 coronavirus patients were hospitalized across the country. Today, that figure has topped 40,000. The health ministry warns the number will climb to 60,000 in the coming weeks. Iran remains among the hardest-hit countries in the world and the worst-hit in the Middle East.Across Tehran, Associated Press journalists have seen signs of the pandemic's toll.At Tehran's Shohadaye Tajrish Hospital, orderlies pushed the bodies of two victims of the coronavirus across a parking lot to its morgue, one wrapped in white, the other in a black body bag. All of its wards on five floors of the hospital are reserved for coronavirus patients. One empty gurney held a bouquet of roses left for a recently deceased man. A heart-shaped balloon hovered over a still respirator.At the massive Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, already reeling from the pandemic, workers laid cinder-block rows of new graves. Mourners in black wept at a stream of funerals. Officials plan to open a new morgue at the site to handle the wave of death, much wrought by what Iranians simply call \"corona.\"Saeed Khal, the director of Tehran's main cemetery, said workers buried 350 bodies there on Tuesday alone - at least 150 had died of coronavirus. The cemetery had never processed that many burials in a single day, not even during Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s that saw 1 million people killed.It was \"one of the hardest and saddest days for my colleagues in the half-century-history of the cemetery,\" Khal told state TV.So much is the influx that some burials are being delayed by a day, unusual for Iran which follows the Islamic practice of immediately burying the dead.Outside the gates of Tehran's Imam Khomeini Hospital complex, where the capital's poor can receive free treatment at its 1,300 beds, scores crowded around one recent day as guards turned away routine cases and allowed in only test-confirmed coronavirus cases.\"They say the wards are full of corona patients,\" said Manijeh Taheri, who sought a regular thyroid treatment for her mother at the hospital. \"I have no idea where to take her when such a huge complex has no place for my mother.\"Field hospitals are being prepared in Tehran and other major cities. State TV has shown images at hospitals outside the capital with patients being treated in hallways.\"We are not going out of the red zone any time soon,\" Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi told state media.President Hassan Rouhani blames the current surge on the fast-spreading variant of the virus first found in Britain, which the government says arrived from neighboring Iraq. Travel between the countries has been restricted since March, though people and commerce continue to cross each day. Overall, Iran has seen 2.2 million reported cases and 67,000 deaths in total.Lawmaker Jalil Rahimi Jahanabadi blamed government mismanagement and continued US sanctions for the virus' spread.\"Sanctions, challenges and wrong decisions will continue. We do not have sufficient vaccines so protect yourself and your relatives through personal health measures,\" he wrote on Twitter.As of now, Iran has administered over 500,000 vaccine doses, according to the WHO. Supplies, however, remain limited. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has banned US and British-made coronavirus vaccines, saying their import is \"forbidden\" because he does not trust those nations. Khamenei has approved the import of vaccines from \"safe\" countries, such as China and Russia, and has backed national efforts to produce a homegrown vaccine with help from Cuba.But officials keep changing when they say the wider public will be vaccinated as it remains unclear when Tehran will have a promised 60 million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine.Amir Afkhami, an associate professor at George Washington University, said that over the past year, Iran's leadership could point to superpowers like the U.S. struggling to contain the virus. With vaccines rolled out in the West and economies reopening, this could become much more difficult to do, he said.\"Ultimately Iran is not self-sufficient when it comes to Covid-19 vaccine development, and it doesn't have the (intensive care unit) beds to absorb the patients it needs to so it really needs external help,\" Afkhami said.Authorities across Iran have closed mosques, restaurants and parks during Ramadan, the Islamic holy fasting month being observed by Muslims around the world. An evening curfew for private cars is in place and travel between cities is banned. Parliament has been suspended for two weeks.But the wider fatigue from the virus has seen people ignore warnings and host fast-breaking meals known as iftars indoors. Already, authorities blamed celebrations around the Iranian New Year known as Nowruz in March for contributing to this wave.Masoud Mardani, an infectious disease specialist on Iran's Covid-19 national task force, has demanded a public curfew. But none so far has come."}

The AstraZeneca vaccines will be part of a campaign aiming to vaccinate 20% of the country's population before the end of the year.Syria's government controls two-thirds of the country, with the rest held by rebels and Kurdish factions. Millions have fled the country or been displaced, and the war has killed some half a million people from the pre-war population of 23 million.Health Minister Hassan Ghabbash made the announcement during a news conference held in the capital Damascus.

Hundreds of thousands more are scheduled to arrive in the coming months.\"The priority for immunization will be frontline health workers who are the first line of defense against COVID ,\" said Ted Chaiban, regional director for the Middle East and north Africa at UNICEF. Speaking with The Associated Press from neighboring Jordan, Chaiban added that after health workers, older people will be vaccinated.The Syrian government has registered over 21,500 cases - including 1,483 deaths - in areas under its control since the first case was reported in March 2020. Over 21,000 infections and over 640 deaths have been recorded in rebel-held northwestern Syria, while the Kurdish areas in the northeast registered 14,400 cases including 477 deaths.Officials in government-controlled areas had already rolled out limited vaccinations following an announcement by Damascus in February that it received an undetermined amount of vaccine from an unnamed friendly country.Separately, the United Arab Emirates said it sent a shipment of Covid-19 vaccine doses that arrived Tuesday in Damascus to help Syria fight the pandemic. It didn't say how many doses or which vaccine.The WHO had said the vaccination campaign in Syria was expected to start in April. It aims to inoculate 20% of the population by the end of 2021."}

Read More\n\nJAKARTA: Indonesia's navy ships are intensely searching the waters where one of its submarines was last detected before it disappeared with 53 people on board, as neighboring countries are set to join the complex operation.\n\nThe KRI Nanggala 402 was participating in a training exercise Wednesday when it missed a scheduled reporting call. Officials reported an oil slick and the smell of diesel fuel near the starting position of its last dive, about 96 kilometers (60 miles) north of the resort island of Bali .\n\nIndonesia's military said that five navy ships and a helicopter were taking part in the search while a hydro-oceanographic survey ship equipped with underwater detection capabilities is on its way to the site around the oil spills. Officials said they had not yet been linked to the missing submarine.\n\nRescue ships from Singapore and Malaysia are expected to arrive Saturday. The military said Australia, the United States , Germany, France, Australia, Russia, India and Turkey have also offered assistance.\n\nSome worry that the area may be too deep to locate or retrieve the ship, suggesting potential challenges facing the search operation.\n\n\"There looks like a terrible tragedy and it's in a very deep part of waters, 700 or 800 meters (2,297 feet or 2,625 feet) deep potentially,\" Australian Defense Minister Peter Dutton told Sydney Radio 2GB .\n\n\"It makes it very difficult for the recovery or for location. But there's some assistance that potentially we can apply and the Chief of the Defense Force (Angus Campbell) obviously reached out to his counterpart to say whatever Australia can provide, we will,\" he said.\n\nThe submarine was carrying 49 crew members, its commander and three gunners, the Indonesian Defense Ministry said.\n\nThe navy said an electrical failure may have occurred during the dive, causing the submarine to lose control and become unable to undertake emergency procedures that would have allowed it to resurface. It said it believes the submarine sank to a depth of 600-700 meters (2,000-2,300 feet).\n\nThe German-built submarine, which has been in service in Indonesia since 1981, was rehearsing for a missile-firing exercise that was to take place on Thursday. Military chief Hadi Tjahjanto and other military leaders were to attend.\n\nIndonesia currently has a fleet of five submarines and plans to operate at least eight by 2024.\n\nThe world's largest archipelago nation with more than 17,000 islands has faced growing challenges to its maritime claims in recent years, including numerous incidents involving Chinese vessels near the Natuna islands.\n\nLast year, president Joko widodo reaffirmed the country's sovereignty during a visit to the islands at the edge of the South China Sea , one of the busiest sea lanes where China is embroiled in territorial disputes with its smaller neighbors.\n\nHis visit came a week after Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang insisted that Chinese fishermen are free to conduct activities in areas China claims as its traditional fishing grounds, which partly overlap Indonesia's exclusive economic zone.\n\nGeng's statement drew indignation in Indonesia and prompted the military to increase its forces at the islands. Although China has been making such claims for years, recently dozens of Chinese fishing boats, escorted by coast guard vessels, have reportedly made more aggressive moves in the area and ignored Indonesian warnings to leave.\n\n"}

(AP)\n\nCANBERRA: Australia has cancelled two Chinese \"Belt and Road'' infrastructure building initiative deals with a state government, provoking an angry response from Beijing.\n\nThe bilateral deals with Victoria state were among four vetoed under new laws that give the federal government power to overrule international agreements by lower-level administrations that violate the national interest, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said late Wednesday.\n\nThe \"Belt and Road'' deals struck with Beijing in 2018 and 2019 triggered the legislative response.\n\nVictoria Education Department pacts signed with Syria in 1999 and Iran in 2004 were also canceled.\n\n\"I consider these four arrangements to be inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adverse to our foreign relations,'' Payne said.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Australia said in a statement the decision \"further shows that the Australian government has no sincerity in improving China-Australia relations.''\n\n\"It is bound to bring further damage to bilateral relations, and will only end up hurting itself,'' the embassy said on Thursday, referring to the Australian government.\n\nThe Global Times , a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party , said in a headline: \"Australia faces serious consequences for unreasonable provocation against China.''\n\nThe move \"marks a significant escalation that could push icy bilateral relations into an abyss,'' the newspaper added.\n\nAustralia's bilateral relations with its most important trading partner are at their lowest point in decades. Chinese government ministers refuse to take phone calls from their Australian counterparts, and trade disruptions are widely seen as China imposing economic punishment.\n\nBut Payne said Thursday she did not expect China to retaliate.\n\n\"Australia is operating in our national interests. We are very careful and very considered in that approach.'' Payne said.\n\n\"It's about ensuring that we have a consistent approach to foreign policy across all levels of government, and it isn't about any one country,'' she said. \"It is most certainly not intended to harm Australia's relationships with any countries.''\n\nVictoria's center-left Labor Party government said the Foreign Relations Act, under which the deals were cancelled, was a matter for the federal government.\n\n\"The Victorian government will continue to work hard to deliver jobs, trade and economic opportunities for our state,'' the statement said.\n\nVictoria's opposition leader Michael O'Brien, who vowed to scrap the deals if he won elections next year, welcomed the federal government's decision.\n\nO'Brien, who belongs to the same conservative Liberal Party as the foreign minister, said the Victorian government had \"given away major infrastructure contracts to Chinese-owned companies'' under one deal.\n\n\"In return, the Chinese government has smashed our farmers with tariffs on barley. They have smashed our wine exporters with trade sanctions,'' O'Brien told Melbourne Radio 3AW.\n\nObservers have described the Victorian deals as vague and non-binding. Some suspect their value to the Chinese Communist Party was to exploit differences in opinion in Australia over \"Belt and Road'' deals, which critics argue can create debt traps for poor countries.\n\nAustralian Defense Minister Peter Dutton said his government would not allow the Chinese Communist Party to use such deals with Australian states as \"propaganda.''\n\n\"Our problem is with the values or the virtues or the outlook of the Chinese Communist Party ,'' Dutton told Sydney Radio 2GB.\n\nThe party had militarized ports in the Asia-Pacific region and Australian security agencies had reported an increased level of foreign interference across the region, Dutton said.\n\n\"We're worried about cyberattacks and we're worried obviously about state governments that enter into compacts with the Communist Party against our national interests,'' Dutton said.\n\n\"We can't allow these sort of compacts, these sort of arrangements and friendships to pop up because they're used for propaganda reasons and we're just not going to allow that to happen,'' he added.\n\n"}

Read More\n\nMOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday sternly warned the West against encroaching further on Russia's security interests, saying Moscow's response will be ``quick and tough'' and make the culprits bitterly sorry for their action.\n\nThe warning during Putin's annual state-of-the-nation address came amid a massive Russian military buildup near Ukraine, where cease-fire violations in the seven-year conflict between Russia-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces have escalated in recent weeks. The United States and its allies have urged the Kremlin to pull the troops back.\n\n``I hope that no one dares to cross the red line in respect to Russia, and we will determine where it is in each specific case,'' Putin said. ``Those who organize any provocations threatening our core security interests will regret their deeds more than they regretted anything for a long time.''\n\nMoscow has rejected Ukrainian and Western concerns about the troop buildup, saying it doesn't threaten anyone and that Russia is free to deploy its forces on its territory. But the Kremlin also has warned Ukraine against trying to use force to retake control of the rebel-held east, saying Russia could be forced to intervene to protect civilians in the region.\n\n``We really don't want to burn the bridges,'' Putin said. ``But if some mistake our good intentions for indifference or weakness and intend to burn or even blow up those bridges themselves, Russia's response will be asymmetrical, quick and tough.''\n\nAs Putin spoke, a wave of protests started rolling across Russia in support of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny , and a human rights group said over 1,000 people were arrested. Thousands marched in central Moscow, where police blocked off a square next to the Kremlin. Police in St. Petersburg blocked off Palace Square, outside the Hermitage museum, and protesters instead massed along Nevsky Prospekt.\n\nThe politician, who is Putin's most persistent critic and was poisoned with a chemical nerve agent last year, started a hunger strike three weeks ago to protest what he said was inadequate medical treatment and officials' refusal to allow his doctor to visit him. His supporters called the rallies as his health reportedly is in severe decline.\n\nIn his speech, Putin pointed to Russia's moves to modernize its nuclear arsenal and said the military would continue to build more state-of-the-art hypersonic missiles and other new weapons. He added that the development of the nuclear-armed Poseidon underwater drone and the Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile is continuing successfully.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the US and its allies, the Russian leader denounced those who impose ``unlawful, politically motivated economic sanctions and crude attempts to enforce its will on others.'' He said Russia has shown restraint and often refrained from responding to ``openly boorish'' actions by others.\n\nThe Biden administration last week imposed new sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2020 US presidential election and for involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies _ activities Moscow has denied. The US ordered 10 Russian diplomats expelled, targeted dozens of companies and individuals, and imposed new curbs on Russia's ability to borrow money.\n\nRussia retaliated by ordering 10 US diplomats to leave, blacklisting eight current and former US officials, and tightening requirements for US Embassy operations.\n\n``Russia has its own interests, which we will defend in line with the international law,'' Putin said during Wednesday's address. ``If somebody refuses to understand this obvious thing, is reluctant to conduct a dialogue and chooses a selfish and arrogant tone, Russia will always find a way to defend its position.''\n\nIn an emotional outburst, Putin chastised the West for acquiring a defiant stance toward Russia.\n\n``Some countries have developed a nasty habit of bullying Russia for any reason or without any reason at all. It has become a new sport,'' he said.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the US allies, he compared them to Tabaqui, a cowardly golden jackal kowtowing to Shere Khan, the tiger in Rudyard Kipling's ``Jungle Book.'' ``They howl to please their lord,'' he said.\n\nRussia this week engaged in a tense tug-of-war with the Czech Republic, following Prague's move to expel 18 Russian diplomats over a massive Czech ammunition depot explosion in 2014. Moscow has dismissed the Czech accusations of its involvement in the blast as absurd and retaliated by expelling 20 Czech diplomats.\n\nPutin also harshly criticized the West for failing to condemn what he described as a botched coup attempt and a failed plot to assassinate Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko , allegedly involving a blockade of the country's capital, power cuts and cyberattacks. Belarusian and Russian security agencies arrested the alleged coup plotters in Moscow earlier this month.\n\n``The practice of organizing coups and planning political assassinations of top officials goes over the top and crosses all boundaries,'' Putin said, drawing parallels to plots against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the popular protests that led to the ouster of Ukraine's former Russia-friendly president, Viktor Yanukovych, in 2014.\n\nRussia responded to Yanukovych's ouster by annexing Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and throwing its support to the separatists in the country's east. Since then, fighting there has killed more than 14,000 people and devastated the industrial heartland.\n\nPutin dedicated most of his annual address to domestic issues, hailing the nation's response to the coronavirus pandemic. He said the quick development of three coronavirus vaccines underlined Russia's technological and industrial potential. He called for a quicker pace of immunizations, voicing hope the country could achieve collective immunity this fall.\n\nHe put forward incentives to help the economy recover from the pandemic and promised new social payments focusing on families with children.\n\n"}

I think we are ready,\" the Italian said.\n\n\"It's true that we didn't have a good moment in the last month, but now we are much better.\"\n\n"}

How difficult are such selection decisions?\n\n(Veteran striker SV Sunil was ignored for the tour of Argentina - TOI Photo)\n\nDoes Tokyo weather call for selection of younger players, who can last longer in humid conditions while playing, for example, five games in 7-8 days?\n\n(Reid was named coach of the Indian team after the sacking of Harendra Singh following the 2018 World Cup - HI Photo)\n\nDo you consider postponement of the game vs Great Britain a setback or did you anticipate that considering the Covid graph?\n\nCovid has ruled the Indian team off-side once again. The rule was abolished by 1992, but a virus is still playing by it -- halting teams right when they seem to be building up pace.India set off on the road after a year and in their first two official internationals, the team got the better of Olympic champions Argentina . But the day they returned home from South America, the virus struck again.India's next away fixture of the Pro League , which was scheduled for May 8 and 9 against Great Britain in London, has been postponed. With the virus mutating and spreading like wildfire in India, the government of the United Kingdom has put India on its 'red list'. Hence, the team can't travel.While that's the unfortunate bit, it doesn't take the shine off of what the Indian team achieved in Buenos Aires.The visitors showed some steel to come back and level the first game at 2-2, before claiming the bonus point in a shootout. The second game saw India dominating the hosts. A 3-0 win was the kind of scoreline coach Graham Reid was looking for.Of the six matches in the Argentine capital, India lost just one, which left Reid chuffed about the outcome.In an interview with Timesofindia.com at the conclusion of the tour, the Australian shared his notes, while keeping Covid central to what lies ahead on the road.We were very happy with the results. Of course, we lost that fifth game. Sometimes you need those wake-up calls every now and then for the players to understand that they have to bring out their best every time. Sometimes as a coach you sort of think, 'Okay, you need those things as medicines.'We need to be a little more frugal in defence. That's still valid. It's always (a) work in progress. As we play against [top] teams, they will try and do things differently to try and beat us. So we have to constantly change our structure a little bit.That's the great thing about competition -- the ability to keep plugging the hole. So when a team [opposition] does that, this is what we do. So if you have experienced it before, you end up with better planning at the end of it.The other thing, of course, is we are trying to make sure we make the most of all the opportunities and try and convert those opportunities into better ones. We had a good number of circle penetrations, but we would like to create more quality opportunities. That's what we will be spending a bit of time on between now and Europe [Pro League tours]. We are working on that.One of things that we worked on was our ability to maintain (a) sustained attack -- what I have been trying to develop with the guys. If the gap is not there at the moment, we [should] move the ball, go to the other side, check. It gives you a bit more control.What we are chasing, of course, is more quality attack based on that. Those things take a while. You train for something and then you see it starting to come [happen] in a game until a little later on. We need to keep working on that, getting them [players] to understand when it's better to just hold the ball, wait for the right opportunity. Having said that, I still like to attack (laughs). So there has to be the right balance.I prefer not to talk about selection in public, to be honest. All I can probably say is it's going to be a really tough selection [for upcoming tours]. Every time you are selecting from this [core] group, it's hard because the quality is there.What I am really trying to do is develop the breadth of the squad, which means when it comes to picking a team, you have the best players available...options. Covid is still a real concern, so you perhaps need even a broader base than you need in a normal campaign, so that you have got quality players who can come in at any point in time.That's what we are trying to do, provide opportunities and also provide as much competition in the squad so that we are pushing ourselves to be better and better.Tokyo will be a tough environment, when we have back-to-back games. That's the good thing about [Pro League tours of] Europe. We will get opportunities to play consecutive games. Historically at the Olympics, there's been a nice gap between games but this time there are going to be back-to-back games. So it's an important skill to have for players to be able to maintain the high tempo of the game.It's good to have players who give you experience but also some youth to bring in the enthusiasm and the extra energy. That's again a constant balance that you try to achieve as a coach.I've said this before, that with the changing scenario world-over due to Covid, we have to take each day as it comes. That is why I always tell the team to not worry about things that are not in our control.For now, our focus is to utilise the facilities in SAI Centre Bengaluru to make the necessary changes to our game based on the Argentina tour analysis and continue as per [Pro League] schedule in Spain and Germany."}

He always remained rooted and identified with his roots, no matter where he travelled and what work he did. Whether he was doing an international or an Indian film, commercial mainstream or independent film or any other, he was intensely rooted to the person he was. That is the most special and endearing thing about him that everyone will remember him for.I was tremendously in awe of him. I got the opportunity to work with him at a time when my career was not flying high and he was an extremely celebrated actor, well known for his craft. For him to put his trust in me as a director and agree to do my film will be the most cherished moments of my life and career. Talvar was a rebirth for me as a filmmaker, and Irrfan sir being in the film was a big part of that. Apart from that, when we collaborated on Talvar, the relationship we shared was precious, it was extremely professional. It was a tricky subject. Not just as an actor, but even while discussing the case, he would throw questions at me, making me constantly question the knowledge I had and not get complacent at any given point \u2013 even though the script was locked and we were shooting. The way his mind worked, and therefore forced my mind to work and to question the alternative, was a precious learning experience for me.I can\u2019t say consciously which part of his personality rubbed off. Unfortunately, our conversations and our equation was limited to working on the film. There was no off-the-set equation with him, not because of anything else, but the sheer regard and awe I felt. I could never think I could have a friendly dinner or a heart-to-heart with him. What has stayed back with me is his questioning mind which I hope I can emulate when the time comes.I met Irrfan sir on and off on my father\u2019s ( Gulzar ) set when he was playing a part in an episode of Kirdaar. I met him in Vishal (Bhardwaj) sir\u2019s office intermittently. But the first one-on-one conversation I had with him was when I met him at his home for the first time after we had given him the script of Talvar. We spoke about the case; he asked me for my perspective and I asked him for his. It\u2019s ironic that he went through the film, played the CBI investigator and till date, I don\u2019t know what his stand on the narrative, the case is. I know he was proud of the work we had done and the product we had put out, but what was going on in his mind is still a mystery to me. And there was so much going on inside but it all looked simple when he executed it on screen. That is where the unassuming part comes into play. There was so much nuance and understudy that went into every role and when he performed, you could not say he was acting. The performance was natural, so much so that it made you believe this is how he laughs, gets angry or cries. That\u2019s the facet of him being unassuming as a person but there was serious hard work that went behind the small gestures, the twitches, the casual one-liners or repartees. It never came off the cuff. It all looked effortless and natural when it came out and one could never call it a performance. But it took a lot of research, deep thinking for him. That is what is special about him."}
